      "The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) began vaccinating ts personnel outside Metro Manila Friday, March 5, with the delivery of the first batch of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) jabs to soldiers based in Cagayan de Oro City.\n",
      "Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) (MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, AFP Chief of Staff, presided over the ceremonial vaccination of military health workers assigned at the Philippine Army’s 4th Infantry Division (4ID) using the CoronaVac vaccines from China’s Sinovac Biotech.\n",
      "A Philippine Air Force C295 aircraft transported 600 vials of Sinovac vaccines from the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City to Lumbia Airfield in Cagayan de Oro.The shipment was then escorted by military and medical personnel to its destination at the 4ID headquarters in Camp Evangelista.\n",

      "(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "PAO, an agency under the Department of Justice (DOJ), has been assisting families in the prosecution of those believed responsible for the deaths of persons inoculated with the anti-dengue Dengvaxia vaccine that is manufactured by French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi Pasteur.It has autopsied a total of 161 dead persons who were reportedly inoculated with Dengvaxia vaccine.\n",
      "In 2017, then Justice Seretary and now National Police Commission (Napolcom) Vice Chairman Vitaliano Aguirre II directed PAO to “extend free legal assistance in civil, criminal and administrative cases to all possible victims of Dengvaxia related injuries, illnesses and deaths.”\n",
      "It was alleged that one of the delays in the arrival of COVID-19 vaccinees is the reported demand for protection by pharmaceutical firms concerning from the possible adverse effects of their products.\n",
      "“Clearly, the Dengvaxia cases cannot be faulted because as shown… it has always been the thrust of vaccine manufacturers to lobby for indemnification programs granting them protection from lawsuits associated with vaccine-related adverse events, especially in the case of COVID-19 vaccines,” PAO said in a statement.It said “the newspaper editorial blaming the PAO and the Chief Public Attorney for the ‘sudden’ demand by vaccine manufacturers for a vaccine injury indemnity mechanism and the delay in vaccine procurement is not only misleading but a ‘Fake News’ intended to derail the Philippines’ response to the C0VID-19 Pandemic.”\n",
      "“Nevertheless, despite opposition attempts to politicize and discredit the government’s response to the pandemic, COVID-19 vaccines have arrived from China (Sinovac) and the Covax Facility (AstraZeneca), and hospitals have started vaccinating their healthcare frontliners,” it pointed out.

      "AstraZeneca’s coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine can give protection against the severe effects of the illness, an infectious disease expert said Friday, March 5.\n",
      "San Lazaro Hospital Infectious Diseases Head Dr. Rontgene Solante emphasized that it is important to get vaccinated against the disease, especially those in the priority sector such as the healthcare workers and the elderly people.\n",
      "A member of the OCTA Research Group Fr. Nicanor Austriaco on Wednesday, March 3, said that the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine against the South African variant of coronavirus “could be reduced from 70 percent to 10 percent.”Solante, meanwhile, cautioned the OCTA research team against giving such statements.\n",
      "“If you read the statements and in fact, I’m going to the hospitals — (some) are telling me, ‘should I receive the Astra vaccines since I do not want to get the Sinovac, but there is this issue on South African variant,’ but I always assure them we don’t have problems with the South African variant,” said Solante in an interview on ABS-CBN News Channel on Friday, March 5.\n",
      "“Just get the vaccine, the most important part is the willingness to get the vaccine.Yung mga variant na iyan doon na natin pag-isipan iyan later on (Let’s think about those variants later), just get the vaccine,” he added.\n",
      "Solante said that the South African variant of coronavirus “is not a variant of concern as of this moment in the Philippines.”“We still need this vaccine and this vaccine is still a good additional vaccine for all Filipinos especially the frontline health workers, those with comorbidities, and probably those who are 65 years and above,” he said.\n",
      "“The point there in the WHO (World Health Organization) findings in that particular trial, it did not prevent the influence of mild to moderate COVID for those who had a South African variant but nobody did develop a severe COVID even with that South African variant, Looking at immunological insights, there is still protection,” he added.\n",
      "“And that’s what we want, especially those for higher risk of mortality. The impact of preventing them from dying from hospitalization,” he furthered.WHO Country Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe also said on Thursday, March 4, that AstraZeneca’s vaccine is effective against this particular variant.\n",
      "“We still believe that the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective even in places where you have a large proportion of cases which could be attributed to the B1351 variant or the South African variant,” he said.\n",

President Duterte, along with top government officials and foreign dignitaries, welcomed the arrival of the plane carrying the 487,200 vaccine doses from the COVAX facility at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) past 7 p.m. on Thursday.\n",
      "The first batch of the vaccines, as well as the 40 million more doses to come, are part of the World Health Organization (WHO)-led COVAX facility allocation to which Team Europe is the biggest contributor. Véron said the Philippines will receive vaccines for 22 million Filipinos under the COVAX facility, aiming to inoculate 20 percent of the population and put an end to the acute phase of the crisis.To date, the EU has provided P130 billion (€ 2.2 billion) to help 92 low and middle-income countries, including the Philippines, to help gain access to COVID-19 vaccines. “The EU has both a responsibility and interest to make vaccines available to all”.\n",

      "CHICAGO, United States (Xinhua) — A research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis indicates that three new, fast-spreading variants of the virus that cause COVID-19 can evade antibodies that work against the original form of the virus that sparked the pandemic.\n",
      "A nurse prepares to administer the COVID-19 vaccine at a hospital in Tripoli, northern Lebanon, on March 4, 2021. (Xinhua / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "To assess whether the new variants could evade antibodies made for the original form of the virus, the researchers tested the ability of antibodies to neutralize three virus variants in the laboratory.\n",
      "The researchers tested the variants against antibodies in the blood of people who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or were vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine. They also tested antibodies in the blood of mice, hamsters and monkeys that had been vaccinated with an experimental COVID-19 vaccine, developed at Washington University School of Medicine, that can be given through the nose.The B.1.1.7 (found in Britain) variant could be neutralized with similar levels of antibodies as were needed to neutralize the original virus. But the other two variants required from 3.5 to 10 times as much antibody for neutralization.\n",
      "The researchers then tested monoclonal antibodies: mass-produced replicas of individual antibodies that are exceptionally good at neutralizing the original virus. When the researchers tested the new viral variants against a panel of monoclonal antibodies, the results ranged from broadly effective to completely ineffective.\n",
      "Since each virus variant carried multiple mutations in the spike gene, the researchers created a panel of viruses with single mutations so they could parse out the effect of each mutation. Most of the variation in antibody effectiveness could be attributed to a single amino acid change in the spike protein. This change, called E484K, was found in the B.1.135 from South Africa and B.1.1.248 from Brazil variants, but not B.1.1.7 from Britain.\n",
      "The B.1.135 variant is widespread in South Africa, which may explain why one of the vaccines tested in people was less effective in South Africa than in the United States, where the variant is still rare, said senior author Michael S. Diamond.“We don’t exactly know what the consequences of these new variants are going to be yet,” said Diamond, also a professor of molecular microbiology and of pathology & immunology. “It is clear that we will need to continually screen antibodies to make sure they’re still working as new variants arise and spread and potentially adjust our vaccine and antibody-treatment strategies.”\n",

      "“Pag every Filipino ganyan ang sitwasyon na magpabakuna na lang sila, wala nang kulang at walang maraming kutso-kutso, then I will open it immediately (When every Filipino can get inoculated without any more fuss, then I will open it immediately),” he said\n",
      "“For now pigil ako sa lalo na mga bata (For now, I am constrained especially when it comes to the children),” Duterte said.Duterte also gave an assurance that the government would exert all efforts to roll out the nationwide COVID-19 Vaccination Program “to enable us to reopen our schools and slowly resume our face-to-face learning.”\n",
      "“To our students, I hope that despite the challenges ahead, you will persevere and strive hard[er] to excel and reach your [full] potential,” he said.\n",
      "In an earlier Palace briefing, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said the President wanted a widespread vaccination effort before he considers the resumption of face-to-face classes in schools.He said the President would like to see around 2 million vaccines administered before deciding on the reopening of traditional learning in schools.\n",
      "The President made the latest statement a few days after the government started its free immunization program, initially offering the vaccines to health workers.\n",
      "After the delivery of the Sinovac vaccines last Sunday, additional doses of vaccines from AstraZeneca are expected to arrive in the country Thursday.\n",
      "More than 400,000 doses will come from the World Health Organization-led global vaccine acquisition scheme.\n",
      "The President is expected to attend the turnover ceremony at the Manila airport.The country is largely under the most relaxed community quarantine level after the government began easing the strict lockdown last year.\n",
      "The pandemic lockdown, first implemented almost a year ago, has weakened the local economy, crippled business operations, and left many people jobless. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "While Filipinos have been asked not to be choosy with the brand of vaccines, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque has invoked President Duterte’s position in government as well as his senior age in justifying his right to choose the brand.\n",
      "“Well you know, I think the President is the president and because he is over 70 years old,” Roque said during a televised press briefing when asked why the President can choose his vaccine brand despite not being a health worker.The country’s health workers, considered heroes for battling the pandemic in the front lines, are given the top priority to get the vaccine supply to enhance their protection against the illness. Next in the vaccination line will be seniors, poor and vulnerable citizens and essential workers.\n",

      "“Kung masusunod talaga, hindi talaga dapat magpabakuna pa si Presidente dahil hindi pa tapos ang mga medical frontliners (If the policy will be followed, the President must not really be vaccinated yet because the vaccination of medical frontliners is not yet complete),” Roque said.\n",
      "The President earlier passed up on getting the Sinovac vaccines despite the recent delivery to the country. The Chinese-made vaccines have not been recommended for health workers, and instead may be used for healthy persons age 18 to 59.The 75-year-old Duterte instead opted to wait for another Chinese brand upon the advice of his doctor. The Palace earlier said the President wanted to be injected with the Sinopharm vaccine and will wait for its emergency use approval by local drug regulators. The Chinese drug manufacturer has reportedly filed its application for emergency use authorization before the Food and Drug Administration. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "A senior citizen waits to receive a COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine at the Rajawadi hospital in Mumbai on March 3, 2021\n",
      "Questions had been raised by Indian medical experts about the effectiveness of Bharat Biotech’s “Covaxin” after officials authorised it for emergency use in January even though its Phase 3 trials — the last stage before regulatory approval — were not complete.\n",
      "“Covaxin (not only) demonstrates high clinical efficacy trend against COVID-19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants,” Bharat Biotech chairman Krishna Ella said in a statement.The company added that “severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events occurred at low levels and were balanced between vaccine and placebo groups”.\n",
      "It said interim phase 3 trial results for Covaxin — co-developed with the scientific agency leading the government’s response, the Indian Council for Medical Research — were based on 43 cases of COVID-19 among 25,800 participants.\n",
      "Of the 43 cases, 36 were recorded in participants who received a placebo and seven in those who were given Covaxin, pointing to an efficacy rate of 80.6 percent after two doses for those who had not previously been infected by the virus, the company added.\n",
      "The firm said it would share further interim analysis after 87 cases, with a final analysis planned for 130 cases.\n",
      "The data from the second and final studies would also be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication, it added.\n",

      "As the number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Metro Manila is feared to further increase due to the rapid spread of the UK COVID variant, the OCTA Research Team recommended that health care workers get themselves inoculated immediately to boost their immunity from the virus.\n",
      "(Photo by Phill Magakoe / AFP)\n",
      "In a virtual press conference on Wednesday, March 3, OCTA noted that the number of COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila could rise by 45,000 by the end of March to 280,000 cases from the current number of 234,754 due to the B117 or UK variant.\n",
      "The group also projected that the number of deaths could rise by about 990 cases “unless everyone especially the national and local governments and health authorities work together in ensuring the spread of the disease is curbed.”OCTA Research fellows recommended that health care workers inoculate themselves with any vaccine available to boost their immunity from the COVID 19 virus, especially with the discovery of the South African B.1.351 variant in Pasay City, as well as the rising number of the UK B.117 variant in certain cities in Metro Manila, including Pasay and Makati.\n",
      "In an online press conference staged for OCTA Research by BluePrint.PH, Dr. Nicanor Austriaco, OP, a molecular biologist from the Providence College in Providence, Rhode Islands, USA and a visiting professor in the University of Sto. Tomas, said.\n",
      "There is still a possibility of containing the spread of the so-called “super-COVID variants,” the South African B.1.351 in particular, if the Pasay City government will undertake quick steps along with the city’s residents in containing the infection from spreading, said Fr. Nicanor Austriaco, a molecular biologist from the Providence College in the US and a visiting professor in the University of Santo Tomas.\n",
      "“We still have a window to eliminate the B.1.351 from circulation. I am hoping that Pasay contain the spread. If the LGU can eliminate the B.1.351, then we are safe. Otherwise, we will have to talk about other options,” Austriaco said.In its March 1 report, OCTA Research said that the surge in cases of COVID-19 is already “inevitable” and that the only steps the government and the public could take is to reduce the potential number of cases by ensuring the containment of the disease through vaccination and practice of the minimum health protocols.\n",
      "OCTA Research chief Guido David of the University of the Philippines noted that Pasay City and Makati City have registered the highest rate of increase in cases in Metro Manila.\n",
      "“If this trend continues and the national reproduction number remains at around Rt 1.2, the country is projected to have 665,000 COVID-19 cases and 14,000 deaths by end of March. If the reproduction number is reduced to Rt 1, the total number of COVID-19 cases is projected to be 640,000 by month’s end, with 13,500 deaths,” David said.“On the other hand, if the reproduction number continues to increase and new COVID-19 cases continue to escalate especially in the NCR, the projection is 715,000 COVID-19 cases and 15,000 deaths by the end of March,” he added.\n",
      "“This trend has been reversed, with significant positive growth in new cases observed in some LGUs in the region. In this light, based on our analysis of the data and the past trends in the NCR, we believe that a surge in its early stages has already started in some LGUs,” OCTA said.\n",
      "However, it should be noted that this potentially serious surge in the NCR is still in its early stages and can still be mitigated, said OCTA Research fellow Ranjit Rye.\n",
      "He said the inevitable rapid increase in COVID-19 cases could still be managed with the “implementation of appropriate and timely responses to reverse this increasing trend quickly and to prevent this ensuing surge from becoming full-blown and potentially overwhelming the health care system in the NCR.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Molecular biologist and OCTA Research Team fellow Fr. Nicanor Austriaco said the detection of the South Africa variant of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Philippines is “most concerning” as it could lessen the efficacy and protection of the AstraZeneca vaccine against this particular variant.\n",
      "(Juan Carlo de Vela / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Citing data from an international study, Austriaco said “the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine against the South Africa variant could be reduced from 70 percent to 10 percent.”\n",
      "“If we do not eliminate the B1.351 (South Africa) variant in the Philippines, then the 17 million doses of AstraZeneca that we have bought, but are not here yet, will be ineffective,” he said in a virtual press conference on Wednesday, March 3.A person may need to have three doses of the remaining vaccines, “one extra just for the B1.351 variant,” instead of the normal two doses, Austriaco also said.\n",
      "The Department of Health on Tuesday, March 2, confirmed the detection of the first six cases of South Africa COVID-19 variant in the country, three of which were traced in Pasay City.\n",
      "Austriaco noted that the ongoing surge in the National Capital Region (NCR), particularly in Pasay City had the “hallmarks of a variant-driven surge.”\n",
      "“We still have a window to eliminate the B1.351 from circulation. I am hoping that Pasay can contain the spread. If the LGU (local government unit) can eliminate the B1.351, then we are safe. Otherwise, we will have to talk about other options,” the OCTA expert explained.Citing a yet-to-be-published data from Brazil, Austriaco said Sinovac could be effective against the B1.351 variant. “In terms of long-term goal, you may want to pick Sinovac over AstraZeneca. It will protect you against the variant, while AstraZeneca will not,” he pointed out.\n",
      "Austriaco cited that the detection of the B1.351 in country will not just be about pandemic control, but should also be about the “impact of this variant on our national vaccine strategy that we have just began.”\n",
      "“So we have just began (but) we have already been hit in the stomach by a variant that if it not is controlled or eliminated, will be more difficult for us to vaccinate the 75 million Filipinos in order to acquire herd immunity,” he said.Moreover, University of the Philippines professor and OCTA research fellow Ranjit Rye pointed out that “OCTA is not suggesting either not to take one vaccine or the other.”\n",
      "“There is a solidarity in OCTA to say that the best vaccine is the vaccine that is available now. We need to get our own health workers vaccinated. We need to get through our priority list as far as the vaccine is concerned,” Rye said.\n",
      "“Whether it’s AstraZeneca or Sinovac, it is still better than not getting vaccinated at all. There are differences and nuances to each vaccine but they can be used, they will be effective. We encourage most especially our healthcare workers to get vaccinated, given the window of opportunity that we have, and given the reality that there is a (COVID-19) surge evolving in NCR,” he added.

      "Senator Nancy Binay on Wednesday urged the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) and local government units (LGUs) to immediately come up with a comprehensive medical waste disposal plan now that the COVID-19 vaccination program has begun.\n",
      "Senator Nancy Binay (Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Binay said it is imperative to ensure that medical wastes would be disposed of properly in order to prevent harmful health risks, noting that while the Department of Health (DOH) has already provided “interim guidelines” for vaccine waste disposal, this might not be enough “because this isn’t a temporary problem.” “We’re dealing with infectious medical wastes here magnified in millions of used vials… yung basta na lang itatapon sa basurahan, kukunin ng truck ng basura at itatambak kung saan (the fact they can just throw it in the garbage bin, and collected by garbage trucks and would be left in some place) elevates public health risks,” Binay warned in a statement.\n",
      "What is worrying, she said, is the capacity and capability of LGUs, especially from geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas, to approach and tackle medical wastes concerns.“I’m worried about the LGUs. Does everyone have a local vaccination plan and comprehensive medical waste disposal plan? Are our LGUs ready to come up with one once they start rolling out the vaccination program?” she pointed out.\n",
      "“Without a local vaccination plan, these concerns could get out of hand, and we should be anticipatory rather than reactive regarding what threatens to be an environmental and public health hazard,” Binay said.\n",
      "She noted that the way infectious healthcare waste is being processed and handled at a snail’s pace since the pandemic started has been alarming.\n",
      "Binay has filed Senate Resolution No. 656 urging the IATF, in consultation with relevant stakeholders in the public and private sectors, to come up with a concrete plan on the proper handling and management of COVID-19 vaccination medical wastes in order to prevent harmful health risks.“Whereas, based on the Philippine National Development and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 Vaccines (Interim Plan, January 2021), waste generated at the health care facilities after vaccination may pose harm and risks to the health care workers and communities if not properly managed,” she said in the explanatory note of her resolution.\n",
      "In her resolution, Binay further emphasized that proper planning and implementation of managing wastes generated in the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination is required, considering the complexity of the nature of the vaccines.\n",
      "She noted that the cause of delay is due to the lack of capacity that waste treatment and disposal facilities have.“And partly because waste haulers need permits so the DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) can keep track of where hospital wastes go,” Binay said.\n",
      "She reiterated the Philippines cannot afford to play catch-up, especially as the plan to vaccinate around 60 to 70 million Filipinos would generate massive amounts of waste.\n",
      "“Our appeal then is for the IATF to make it part of the checklist for LGUs their comprehensive local vaccination plan and infectious medical/healthcare waste plan,” she said.\n",
      "“In a span of two to five years, we expect more than 70 million Filipinos to get vaccinated, because these are double-doses and that would mean over 140 million units for the vaccine paraphernalia alone. We haven’t counted how much tons of concomitant waste would be there,” she said.\n",
      "“I really hope that the IATF and LGUs are prepared once the vaccines start arriving. I hope the IATF would be serious on this too and not to forget it,” she added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“If the virus doesn’t choose its victims, then why should we choose who among the hospital workers should get the vaccine first? Private or public, basta nanggagamot ng Pilipino, at may supply, bigyan (Whether they are public or private hospitals, as long as they treat Filipinos, and there is supply, then we should given them the vaccines),” Villanueva said in a statement.\n",
      "“If there’s left from the allocation of public health workers because many of them aren’t taking it, then give the surplus to those who are willing to receive it,” he added.Villanueva made the comments after National Task Force against COVID-19 and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. disclosed on Monday that the St. Luke’s Medical Center has asked the government for an allocation of vaccines from Sinovac for its 5,000 workers.\n",
      "Galvez said there will be a “mini rollout” of the vaccinations in the hospital’s two branches.\n",
      "In appealing for the grant of vaccines to private health workers, Villanueva stressed that the government should avoid the “spoilage of a precious and scarce commodity”.\n",

Ang bakuna po ay mahalaga, huwag i-aksaya (Vaccines are important, let’s not waste them),” he added.Villanueva earlier called on the government to augment the country’s vaccine supply and allow health workers to choose which vaccines they want to receive.

      "The availability of the vaccine, she said, “will have a positive impact on our lives as we can slowly go back go our jobs, promote livelihood opportunities, open up our industries and the economy and navigate a new ‘normal life’.”The senator added that Filipinos, especially health frontliners, would finally be protected from the deadly infection.“The vaccine connotes hope and a much better future for Filipinos,” Villar said.\n",
      "The government started on March 1, its vaccination program among health workers in government hospitals as well as health personnel in the police and military.At least 756 health frontline health workers received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac, according to authorities.The Department of Health said at least 20 people experienced minor reactions to the vaccines.\n",
      "Still, Villar reminded the public not to be complacent despite the vaccine rollout.“Do not let your guard down,” she said, citing compliance to health protocols such as the wearing of face masks and face shield, as well the regular hand washing in physical distancing.

      "“We believe that we will be able to recover only if our workers are protected,” he explained. “Protected workers equals jobs,” he added.Government data showed that up to 17 million workers lost their jobs at the height of enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) from March to April in 2020.Villanueva said millions of families suffered economically because of the pandemic.\n",
      "“This is unacceptable,” he stressed.\n",
      "Villanueva said there was only one thing needed for the country to get back on its feet: “Work, work, work.”The vaccination program, according to Villanueva, has been stripped of obstacles in sourcing and procurement of supplies by the law that Congress passed and which President Duterte signed recently.\n",

      "Anakalusugan Party-List Rep. Mike Defensor\n",
      "(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Instead, Defensor said portions of the slashed funding went to pork barrel funds, apparently for lawmakers.\n",
      "Defensoraired these claims as he accused ACT-CIS Partylist Rep. Eric Go Yap, chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations,of lying before their Lower House colleagues for claiming that the P20 billion slashed from the military and police retirees’ pension fund went to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) fund.Defensor said Yap’s claim is simply “not true”The former made this claim a day after the two solons debated on the floor in connection with Defensor’s allegations about the slashed funding.\n",
      "“The claim of appropriations committee chairman Rep. Eric Yap that P20 billion in military and police retirees’ pension money was diverted to Covid-19 vaccine procurement is not true,” said Defensor.\n",
      "In a privilege speech on Monday, Defensor, former chairman of the House Committee on Public Accounts, accused Speaker Lord Allan Velasco of denying retired personnel of uniformed services at least P20 billion from their pension fund to boost congressional allocations for infrastructure projects.\n",
      "Yap quickly rose to defend Velasco, saying that Defensor was mistaken about his accusations.Yap said it was he who decided to realign the fund to finance the procurement of COVID 19 vaccine.Defensor’s revelation opened a can of worms in the Lower House as Yap accused the administration of former Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of slashing P70 billion in proposed budgetary allocation for the same pension fund when the 2020 GAA was passed.\n",
      "Yap also blamed Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab, his predecessor as appropriations chief, for the re-aligned pension fund.\n",
      "Ungab swiftly belied Yap’s claim, saying that what the Cayetano speakership re-aligned was P209 billion and not P70 billion.He also decried Yap’s accusations, saying that the re-alignment was decided by Cayetano and then Deputy Speaker LRay Villafuerte behind his back.In his press statement, Defensor said Yap was wrong in claiming that the P20-billion in the 2021 budget was re-aligned for vaccine procurement.“To set the record straight, the vaccine procurement fund approved by Congress, as recommended by the bicameral conference committee (bicam) and carried in the 2021 budget, was P2.5 billion, which is good for just a few thousand doses and which was the amount recommended by the executive branch at the beginning of the pandemic,” Defensor stressed.\n",
      "“That is the amount that is sure of funding, as it is part of the “programmed” portion of the national budget,” he pointed out.\n",
      "According to Defensor an additional P172 billion was allocated by Congress but placed it in the ‘unprogrammed part of the outlay.”This means that the budget will be made available only if there are excess revenues.\n",
      "Instead of relying on excess revenue collection, the Duterte administration decided to resort to “borrowing to finance the COVID-19 response measure”.“Through the bicam, Congress juggled at least P182 billion in appropriations recommended by President Duterte in his version of the budget. None of that, not even a centavo or peso, was added by the two chambers to the Palace-recommended P2.5-billion vaccine procurement fund,” said Defensor. He added: “The huge amount of realignments, including the P20 billion for military and police retirees, went to “pork” and other things, but not vaccine.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“Hindi ako puwedeng magsinungaling bobolahin kayo eh (I cannot lie to you or deceive you),” Duterte said during a televised address Monday, March 1.“Wala talagang supply (There is really no supply). I’d like to say it in — my dear countrymen, ginusto ko man, sabi ko, buy, steal, or borrow, wala akong makuha (I can’t get anymore),” he added.\n",
      "Given the limited global supply of vaccines, the President pointed out that country was in the same boat as most nations facing difficulty in vaccine procurement.\n",
      "Duterte previously said the nation would just have to wait for the vaccines after 10 rich countries have acquired 75 percent of the world’s supply of coronavirus vaccines.United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres earlier criticized the unfair distribution of the vaccines, after 10 nations administered most of the supply.\n",
      "“Walang bakuna ngayon available, either hingiin mo, nakawin mo o bayaran mo (There is no vaccine available — either you beg, steal or pay for it),” Duterte said.\n",

      "Among the suppliers are Novavax and AstraZeneca. By the third quarter, Galvez said the country could expect the arrival of 68 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. An additional 69 million vaccines doses will be delivered to the country by the fourth quarter of the year.\n",
      "“All in all po, Mr. President, Mr. Mayor, ay mayroon po tayong 161 million doses kasama na po iyong 44 million na COVAX (All in all, Mr. President, Mr. Mayor, we have 161 million doses including 44 million from COVAX),” Galvez said during a meeting with the President and other government officials on pandemic response.\n",

      "Other regions, especially those with reported increase in cases of infections, will also receive vaccine allocation from the government.\n",
      "The government has launched its vaccination campaign Monday in a bid to boost public protection after the pandemic infected over half a million people and weakened the local economy in recent months.The first batch of the Sinovac vaccines donated by China arrived in Manila last Sunday.\n",
      "The government aims to vaccinate 70 million citizens this year to attain herd immunity but recent polls indicated vaccine hesitancy among some peopleover safety concerns.The President earlier assured the public of the government’s resolve to ensure a timely vaccine rollout to overcome the health crisis and “enables us to confidently reopen our society.”“We cannot afford to waste time or resources in the distribution of these vaccines because we are dealing with precious lives,” he said in his remarks after welcoming the vaccine arrival over the weekend.

These vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1.“Although AstraZeneca was tentatively scheduled on Monday, this was not possible and we now believe that we will hear of a possible date…I don’t want to create any expectations until we have a firm date. So when we know of a firm date and which we believe will be very soon, we will announce that,” said Abeyasinghe.\n",
      "“The consignments are ready and just logistics arrangements are being made. So once we have a finalization and a confirmed itinerary of the delivery, we will share that information,” he added.\n",
      "At the global level, Abeyasinghe said that they are facing two bottlenecks in the delivery of the essential vaccines around the globe.“The (first) bottleneck that we are talking of was the manufacturers unable to meet the manufacturing targets because these are biological processes and they could not produce the quantities that they anticipated that they could early on,” said the WHO official.“We are now seeing a second bottleneckthat is the delivery processes because these vaccines need to be transported: maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world,” he said.\n",

      "The government poses “no objection” if the country’s medical frontliners would prefer to take coronavirus vaccines developed by western manufacturers instead of Chinese suppliers, President Duterte said Monday.\n",
      "President Rodrigo Roa Duterte\n",
      "As the government kicked off the vaccination drive, the President said he respects the “right” of health professionals to choose the vaccine brand.\n",
      "At least 600,000 doses of vaccines developed by Sinovac Biotech have been donated by China to the Philippines. The country’s immunization drive kicked off Monday, a day after these Chinese vaccines, the country’s first supply, arrived in Manila.“Even the doctors, some are not quite keen sa Sinovac but that’s their right. They want maybe the US. It could be AstraZeneca, it could be Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson is US talaga ‘yan. It could be Moderna…Wala kaming objections diyan kung ayaw ninyo (We have no objection to that),” the President said during his televised address Monday, March 1.\n",
      "According to the President, the health workers could wait to get inoculated if they refuse to take the Sinovac vaccine.“Maghintay na lang kayo pag magdating ng bakuna (You may wait for the arrival of the vaccine) of your choice and not the ones being applied now to the people,” Duterte said.\n",
      "“We respect your decision on the matter,” he added.The country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier allowed the emergency use of the Sinovac vaccines in the country. The vaccine however has been not been recommended to health workers exposed to COVID-19 patients due to its varying efficacy levels.The local drug regulator later clarified that this was only a recommendation, adding the health workers may still receive the vaccine if they want.\n",
      "The Palace earlier disclosed that the President was “perplexed” after the FDA advised against the use of the Sinovac vaccine on health workers.Duterte even summoned FDA chief Rolando Enrique Domingo to the Palace to explain such “colatilla” on the Sinovac vaccine even though the World Health Organization laid down the 50 percent minimum threshold of vaccine efficacy.\n",
      "The President has passed up the chance to get vaccinated with Sinovac drug and decided to wait for the arrival of another Chinese-developed brand. Duterte, 75, said his doctor advised him on the vaccine brand suitable for his advanced age. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“We hope the national government, in coordination with the LGUs, will ensure that our health workers in the NCR and nearby provinces would be vaccinated together with the other front liners identified as a priority by the national vaccination program,” it added.Moreover, given that a surge of new cases in the NCR is anticipated in the next few weeks and could possibly overwhelm its health care system and its workers, the OCTA Research Team encouraged health workers in the NCR and in the adjacent provinces, together with the other front liners identified as a priority by the national vaccination program, to get themselves vaccinated.“There is a very small window of opportunity for health workers in the NCR to get vaccinated while the surge is still in its early stages and hospital occupancy in the region is still manageable,” it said.\n",

      "The government earlier disclosed plan to vaccinate up to 70 million people this year in a bid to reach herd immunity against the new coronavirus disease.“Notwithstanding the provision of Section 4 (g) of Republic Act No. 10918, otherwise known as the ‘Philippine Pharmacy Act’, and Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7392 otherwise known as the ‘Philippine Midwifery Act of 1992’ and in furtherance of the COVID-19 Vaccination Program, licensed pharmacists and midwives who are duly trained by the DOH may administer COVID-19 vaccines,” the law read.\n",

      "RA 11525, signed by the President on Feb. 26, also included the creation of a P500-million COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund that will be administered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.The same law provides “immunity from liability” of public officials and employees, contractors, manufacturers, volunteers, and representatives of private entities involved in the vaccination program in case of claims from vaccine administration or use except arising from “willful misconduct and gross negligence.”Some vaccine makers earlier sought legal protection from any lawsuit in case a person suffers adverse side effects after taking the COVID-19 shot. The indemnity requirement resulted in the delay in the delivery of the Pfizer vaccines under the COVAX facility to the country. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“Sabay po kami magpapabakuna, in public po, at inaantay nalang namin, pinagpipilian ng kanyang doktor kung ano pong bakuna ang pwede sa kanyang edad na pwede sa kanyang kalusugan (We will be inoculated together in public, we are just waiting for his doctor’s advice on what vaccine should be used considering the President’s age and state of health)” he added.Go said that once the President’s physician has recommended a vaccine, they would be inoculated together in public.\n",
      "He also stated that several public officials, led by Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. and Secretary Vince Dizon, have agreed to be vaccinated in public to allay apprehensions about getting inoculated due to safety concerns.\n",
      "Go said that vaccine czar Secretary Galvez and Deputy Chief Implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19 Vince Dizon are willing to be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine.Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chair Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos Jr. has likewise volunteered to be inoculated.\n",
      "Go, who chairs the Senate health committee, said that only the success of the vaccination program could restore normalcy in the country. “‘Wag po kayong matakot sa bakuna, matakot po kayo sa COVID-19 (Do not be afraid of the vaccine, be afraid of COVID-19.)\n",
      "“Kailangan natin ipakita sa publiko na ang bakuna ay dapat pagkatiwalaan. Ang bakuna ang tanging susi o solusyon sa ating pagbabalik sa normal nating pamumuhay (We need to show to the public that the vaccine should be trusted. The vaccine is the only key or solution for us to return to our normal way of living),” Go added.He acknowledged that many frontliners remain hesitant but stressed that medical and other frontline workers must be prioritized in the vaccination in order to preserve the healthcare system.Yesterday, Go joined President Duterte at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City to personally witness the arrival of the 600,000 Sinovac vaccine doses donated by the Chinese government. He said that the arrival of vaccines is also a testament to the Philippines’ strong diplomatic relations with other countries and multilateral organization. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Glovax Biotech, a Filipino-owned vaccine distributor and proponent of the P7-billion vaccine manufacturing venture, is looking to supply 40 million doses of next generation COVID-19 vaccines from Korea 50 percent cheaper than what is currently being offered by vaccine producers.\n",
      "Glovax Biotech President Giovanni Alingod announced during a briefing that he has already informed government officials, including Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the Philippines’ Declared National Policy Against COVID-19, of the available vaccine supply called EuCorVac-19 of Eubiologics from South Korea.\n",
      "Glovax Biotech President Giovanni Alingod\n",
      "He explained that the EuCorVac-19 of Eubiologics was developed in Western New York, USA by POP Biotechnologies and has been approved for Human Clinical Trials. The South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety also approved the combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials last January 2021. The firm is just awaiting the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Authority (EUA) for the mass production of the next generation vaccines in South Korea.\n",
      "For the Philippine supply, Alingod said Glovax and Eubiologics are also in the process of applying for an EUA from the Food and Drugs Administration. Should they get the EUA by May this year and successfully convince the government to order the 40 million doses, Alingod said they can bring in the next generation EuCorVac-19 vaccines over a period of six months.He said Eubiologics can only produce 100 million doses annually in South Korea but because of its long established partnership, Glovax was able to secure 40 million doses. In fact, he said, other countries are asking South Korea to supply them with the vaccines at higher prices.\n",
      "But for the Philippines, he said, “It will be 50 percent cheaper than the first generation COVID-19 vaccines.” While the price is not yet revealed, Alingod noted that the vaccine being offered now by the first generation manufacturers costs between P3,600 to P3,900 a dose.Glovax, the only vaccine-focused Filipino pharmaceutical distributor in the country, has partnerships with Korean firm Eubiologics since 2017 and LG Chem in 2005. These two firms are World Health Organization (WHO) Pre-Qualified Vaccine manufacturers.\n",
      "Alingod said they have approached the SM Group for a partnership that will allow the use for free a space in their malls as vaccination centers for their host local government units.\n",
      "Alingod, however, said that the proposed vaccine manufacturing plant announced last Feb. 22, is tied with the Philippine government’s purchase of 40 million doses of EuCorVac-19 vaccines. This means the ambitious project may only be pursued if government purchases the 40 million doses of EuCorVac-19.\n",
      "According to Alingod, the vaccine plant will produce the next generation COVID-19 vaccine and the Pentavalent Vaccine in partnership with Eubiologics and LG Chem, respectively. The plant will ensure that the Philippines has a vaccine manufacturing capability and a facility that could be used for vaccine production in case of new pandemics in the future.\n",
      "They are reportedly in talks with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Board of Investments and the National Development Company, the investment arm of the DTI, for possible funding or minority equity share in the construction of the first ever vaccine plant in the Philippines.\n",
      "There are also other foreign groups interested to help put up the facility, which should be in an economic zone near an international airport. They are initially looking at Clark Special Economic Zone.Alingod, who reportedly started his company by selling his wedding gifts, justified the P7 billion Next Generation COVID Vaccine plant. He said the P7 billion investment includes the construction and the technology transfer costs.The planned vaccine manufacturing plant, he said is a complete technology transfer from Korea and the US from active pharmaceutical ingredients up to formulation and capable of producingany vaccine for new pandemics that may come in the future and make the Philippines self reliant.\n",
      "“Hopefully Eubiologics can help in vaccinating Filipinos and if takes years to vaccinate we can shorten the timeframe if can have own vaccine plant,” he stressed. Should the plan push through, he expects start of construction within the year.“It is estimated that the world could vaccinate all its population in 7 years and the local vaccine plant can help reduce that timeframe especially for the Philippines. This will be the legacy of our President Rodrigo Duterte as it will be in partnership with the DTI, BOI, NDC, Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology, and IATF, among different government agencies.”\n",
      "As traditional vaccine manufacturers, Alingod said that Eubiologics and LG Chem have already produced vaccines in the past that were used by UNICEF, unlike other COVID vaccine manufacturers.\n",
      "And as producer of Next Generation COVID vaccine, he said EuCorVac-19 would be more effective to fight the newer COVID strains and other mutations unlike the first generation COVID vaccines which are only 22 percent effective against the new South African strain and other new strains found around the world.\n",
      "The next generation COVID vaccine can also be stored up to 25°C or room temperature up to 3 months and 2°C to 8°C for longer period, unlike the first generation of COVID vaccines which requires freezing temperature that the Philippinesis not well-equipped with.\n",
      "According to Alingod, Glovax is the first and only vaccine company to bring in the first pandemic vaccine in 2009/2010 during the AH1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic.“If anyone could remember, there was also a shortage of the Pandemic Vaccine during the AH1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic,” he said. “With this experience, the proposed vaccine plant can avert the current and future pandemic.”\n",
      "Since 2003, Glovax had brought in more 5 million vaccine doses of various types of vaccines, including Polio, Tuberculosis, Measles, Tetanus, Pentavalent, and Rabies. It is the only vaccine-focused company in the Philippines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Dr. Alfonso Famaran received the first dose of China’s Sinovac vaccine shortly after 9:30 a.m. and said he did not feel any pain while being inoculated.\n",
      "“The best comparison dito is…pneumococcal vaccine. Yung pneumococcal vaccine, 30 minutes after, meron ng pain sa injection site. Itong Sinovac, wala eh (With the pneumococcal vaccine, after 30 minutes, I felt pain in the injection site. But with Sinovac, none),” Famaran told reporters after his inoculation.“Tapos yung entry ng vaccine…itong Sinovac [di ko napansin]…tapos na pala. Wala akong naramdaman kasi nilagyan nalang ng band-aid (I also didn’t notice the entry of the Sinovac needle. I was surprised that it’s already done. I did not feel anything until I realized that they were already putting band-aid on my shoulder),” he added.\n",
      "Since he is allergic to penicillin and seafood, the hospital’s medical chief said, he had to be monitored for 30 minutes until he was cleared of possible adverse effects.\n",
      "Testing Czar Sec. Vince Dizon, who also was present in the rollout and received a vaccine shot, agreed with Famaran.\n",
      "“Lahat ng sinabi ni Doc, ‘yun din naramdaman ko (I also experienced what Dr. Famaran experienced),” he said, “Mas masakit yung flu vaccine. Doon, medyo nakaramdam ako ng sakit. Dito wala akong naramdaman at all (Flu vaccine, for me, is more painful. When I got vaccinated against the flu, I felt a bit of pain. But with COVID, I didn’t feel anything at all).”Famaran and Dizon were only among the dozens of frontliners from DJNRMC who received the first dose of vaccine against COVID-19, which arrived in the country on Sunday, Feb. 28.\n",
      "The rollout, which was also led by Caloocan Mayor Oca Malapitan and Department of Health Assistant Secretary Elmer Punzalan, started at around 9 a.m. But by 12 noon, there were hardly any frontliners lined up for vaccination.\n",
      "A personnel at the registration site told reporters that more were expected to come by late afternoon.178 Sinovac volunteers\n",
      "In an interview with reporters, Famaran said that only 178 of the hospital’s 1,111 priority workers volunteered to get the Chinese vaccine.\n",
      "Asked why only a small number of the hospital’s workers wanted Sinovac, Famaran said, this is because the vaccine has less acceptance rate among their employees.\n",
      "“Ang expected kasi namin is Pfizer-BioNTech, so…mataas yung vaccine acceptance noon sa hospital na ‘to: 95 percent (We were expecting that Pfizer-BioNTech would arrive first. So it has a high acceptance rate of 95 percent),” he said.\n",
      "“Well informed sila sa data eh (Because workers here are well-informed with the data), when it comes to Pfizer-BioNTech,” he added.But both Famaran and Dizon maintained that the Chinese vaccine has “100 percent” efficacy rate or “percentage of protection,” particularly against getting severe cases of COVID-19.\n",
      "“Ang healthcare worker, kapag sya’y nabakunahan ng Sinovac, 100 percent or sigurado syang hindi magkakaroon ng severe COVID-19 (If a healthcare workers is already vaccinated with Sinovac, it os 100 percent sure that he will no longer experience severe COVID-19 case),” Dizon said.\n",
      "Sinovac has 60-70 percent protection against moderate cases, and 50 percent against mild cases, the testing czar added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.\n",
      "(NTF AGAINST COVID-19 / FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Galvez, the vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19, led the symbolic vaccination at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) in Manila where he vowed to take the Sinovac jab himself after all healthcare workers were vaccinated against COVID-19 in adherence to the government’s priority list.\n",
      "“We will not be able to go to the ‘new normal’ way of our lives and our economy will not recover if we won’t be vaccinated. Getting vaccinated is a moral obligation of all people,” he said.Galvez said that the public should no longer wait for the “best vaccine,” seemingly referring to other brands with higher efficacy ratings.\n",
      "“There is no such thing as ‘best vaccine’ because the best vaccine is the one that is safe, effective, and readily available to us now. What importance will it be if there is a vaccine that has a high efficacy rating but will come in the third quarter? We should get whatever vaccine arrives first,” he noted.\n",
      "Sinovac reportedly registered an efficacy rate of 65.3 to 91.2 percent based on vaccinations in Indonesia and Turkey although it had a lower rating of 50.4 percent when administered to healthcare workers in Brazil.\n",
      "In the first quarter of 2021, Galvez said around 5.1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be delivered in the country including one million doses of Sinovac jabs that are set to arrive in March alone.Also included in the shipment are 3.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines from the Covax facility, of which the first batch consisted of 525,600 doses was originally scheduled to be delivered on March 1 but was delayed by one week due to supply shortage and logistical problems.\n",
      "“After this [rollout], the supply of vaccines will start coming in. We will try to get all the available vaccines that we can and give it to our healthcare workers. Our pledge is to finish the vaccination of all healthcare workers in March,” Galvez said.\n",

I asked for vaccines for family and me),” Duterte said during a press conference Sunday, Feb. 28, after welcoming the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by China to the country\n",
      "“I don’t know if we would have enough vaccines for everybody but I think I can accommodate the — itong Cabinet members,” he added during the turnover ceremony held at the Villamor Airbase in Pasay City.\n",
      "The President is not among the first recipients of the Sinovac vaccines given by China as he waits for the other Chinese brand recommended by his doctor.\n",
      "“My doctor has in mind. It’s a Chinese brand still pero hindi ito. Siya ‘yong nakaalam ng constitution ng katawan ko (It’s a Chinese brand but it’s not this. My doctors know the constitution of my body),” he said.The President made the remarks a few days after former special envoy to China Ramon Tulfo revealed Duterte’s preference for the Sinopharm vaccine. The newspaper columnist also bared he arranged a phone call between the President and a Sinopharm representative and that the former asked for vaccines for him and his family.\n",
      "Sinopharm has yet to secure an emergency use approval for its vaccines in the country. The Food and Drug Administration however allowed the Presidential Security Group to secure Sinopharm vaccines under a compassionate use license. The Palace earlier said the legal team was studying if the President can get the Sinopharm vaccine under such compassionate use permit.\n",
      "Even though he won’t get the Sinovac vaccine, the President tried to assure the public that such a vaccine is effective in preventing coronavirus illness.“I am giving the guarantee that it is effective. That efficacy is good,” he said.\n",
      "Duterte also encouraged people to get vaccinated, telling them to get their doctor’s advice on which vaccine to take.\n",
      "“Ngayon, ‘yong ayaw magpabakuna, wala akong magawa para sa inyo (Now, to those who refused to be vaccinated, I can’t do anything for you) or you might want at least you know in your lifetime, may kilala kang doktor, magtanong ka na lang sa doktor kung anong mabuti sa iyo (if you know a doctor, ask the doctor what will be good for you),” he said.\n",
      "He noted that although senior citizens like him are “discouraged” from getting the vaccine, he is prepared to get vaccinated. “Pero ako, since I get to go around and meet people to travel, baka kailangan ko (I might need it),” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "In his speech, Roque pointed out that March 1, 2021, was a historic day for the Philippines.“Ang gagawin po natin dito sa PGH at iba pang pampublikong hospital dito sa Metro Manila ay pagsimula po ng pag-asa na matapos po ang halos isang taon ng kadiliman dahil sa COVID-19, narito na po ang liwanang (What we will be doing here at the PGH and other public hospitals in Metro Manila is the start of our hope that after almost one year of darkness due to COVID-19, here comes the light),” he said.\n",

This is our way of showing gratitude to our healthcare workers),” he added.The Philippines rolled out the vaccination program with the CoronaVac vaccine manufactured by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac.

      "The United States on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson’s Covid vaccine for emergency use, boosting President Joe Biden’s plan to battle the outbreak that has killed more than 500,000 Americans.\n",
      "The single-shot vaccine — the third type to be authorized — is highly effective in preventing severe Covid-19, including against newer variants, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said before giving it a green light.“Starting tonight, 3.9 million doses of J&J will be distributed across all channels — states, tribes, territories, and pharmacies and community health centers. Those J&J doses will be delivered as early as this Tuesday morning,” the administration official said Sunday on a call with reporters.\n",
      "“That’s the entirety of J&J’s current inventory,” the official added. “J&J expects to deliver approximately 16 million additional doses by the end of March. So that’s a cumulative 20 million.”\n",
      "The J&J vaccine is the third to be greenlighted in the United States after Pfizer’s and Moderna’s were provisionally approved in December.\n",
      "Over 65 million people in America have so far received at least one shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines — but unlike those, the J&J vaccine requires just one dose, and is stored at fridge temperatures, offering logistical and practical advantages.The J&J shot appears less protective than Pfizer and Moderna’s two-shot regimens, which both have an efficacy of around 95 percent against all forms of Covid-19 from the classic coronavirus strain.\n",
      "In large clinical trials, the J&J vaccine’s efficacy against severe disease was 85.9 percent in the United States, 81.7 percent in South Africa, and 87.6 percent in Brazil.\n",
      "Overall, among 39,321 participants across all regions, the efficacy against severe Covid-19 was 85.4 percent, but it fell to 66.1 percent when including moderate forms of the disease.All three vaccines have been shown to fully protect against hospitalizations and death, however.\n",
      "J&J had earlier announced it aims to deliver 20 million doses by the end of March, with 100 million by June — though the US is pushing to expedite that timeline. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

I know we are desperate for a vaccine but not at the expense of our workers),” Robredo said during her weekly radio show, “BISErbisyong Leni.”\n",
      "Fortunately, both countries already said they will not enter into an agreement that will send Filipino nurses in exchange for COVID-19 jabs.Various health workers’ groups criticized Bello over the week over his offer to deploy more nurses to the United Kingdom and Germany in exchange for COVID-19 vaccines.This was after British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce requested to hire more Filipino nurses because of the pandemic. The Philippine government has set a 5,000-cap on the number of nurses who can be deployed overseas due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n",
      "Germany made a similar request to hire more Filipino nurses, but Bello said he hasn’t talked to the German ambassador in Manila yet.“Our target should be to improve the environment here for our health workers so they won’t need to leave,” Robredo said in Filipino.\n",
      "Although a lot of people agree that health workers are the “heroes” of the pandemic, Robredo asked how the government is treating them.\n",

      "According to Maronilla, customs agents will first get an opportunity to count the number of vaccines received by the country from importers during then handling of the jabs at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City.“Pagdating po ng RITM nandun po mga customs officers namin para lang po tignan yung paglipat niya sa doon cold storage facility. Makikita na namin kung ilang boxes or ilang pieces per box yung laman para ma-confirm namin sa papeles na binigay sa amin (Our customs officers will be at the RITM to watch the transfer of the vaccines to the cold storage facility. We will see the number of boxes and how many pieces there are per box and from there we can confirm the figure on the papers given to us),” he said.\n",
      "“Kung sakaling hindi mag-tally yung mga dokumento, bibigyan lang po namin ng pagkakataon yung importer na i-correct yung mistake na yun and at the same time inform yung FDA (Food and Drug Administration) na ito yung totoong numbers na dumating (In case the numbers don’t tally with the documents, we will just give the importer the opportunity to correct the mistake and at the same time inform the FDA as to the actual number of vaccines that arrived),” he explained.\n",
      "Some 600,000 doses of CoronaVac vaccines made by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech Ltd. are expected to arrive Sunday. This will have been the first batch of jabs to arrive in the country.\n",

This will allow the items to forego the usual process of opening the boxes for inspection and even x-ray examination.“Hindi po pwedeng buksan yung shipment na ito, hindi rin po siya pwedeng idaan nga sa x-ray kahit ano klaseng examination (We aren’t allowed to open this shipment, and we can’t conduct x-ray or any type of examination on it),” he said.

      "FDA said local clinical trial data showed that the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 65.3 to 91.2 percent when used on clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59, however, it has a lower efficacy rate of only 50.4 percent on healthcare workers.\n",

      "“But we cannot let our guard down now or assume that victory is inevitable,” he said.A third vaccine is seen as a vital means to ramp up the immunization rate in the United States, where more than 500,000 people have lost their lives to the coronavirus.In large clinical trials, the J&J vaccine’s efficacy against severe disease was 85.9 percent in the United States, 81.7 percent in South Africa, and 87.6 percent in Brazil.Overall, among 39,321 participants across all regions, the efficacy against severe COVID-19 was 85.4 percent, but it fell to 66.1 percent when including moderate forms of the disease.\n",

      "The J&J vaccine is the third to be greenlighted in the United States after Pfizer’s and Moderna’s were provisionally approved in December.Over 65 million people in America have so far received at least one shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines — but unlike those, the J&J vaccine requires just one dose, and is stored at fridge temperatures, offering logistical and practical advantages.\n",
      "The J&J shot appears less protective than Pfizer and Moderna’s two-shot regimens, which both have an efficacy of around 95 percent against all forms of COVID-19 from the classic coronavirus strain.\n",
      "All three have been shown to fully protect against hospitalizations and death, however.\n",
      "Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Washington Post the two earlier vaccines were tested months before the emergence of “variants of concern” that could affect the efficacy, meaning the Pfizer and Moderna results were not an “apples to apples” comparison with the J&J shot.There was a hint, based on preliminary data, that the J&J vaccine might be effective against asymptomatic infection — though the company said it needs to do more research.The company has announced it aims to deliver 20 million doses by the end of March, with 100 million by June — though the US is pushing to expedite that timeline.\n",

      "Senator Sonny Angara\n",
      "According to February 24 Bloomberg data, some 213 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have already been administered in 95 countries. And with an average inoculation rate of 6.1 million a day, it was estimated that it will take 5.1 years before global herd immunity — where at least 75 percent of the world’s population is vaccinated — will be achieved.\n",
      "Attaining this herd immunity to finally end the pandemic entails surmounting the greatest logistical challenge humanity has ever faced in modern history. It also involves navigating some of the deepest inequalities between and within nations.At a recent virtual meeting of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres decried that current COVID-19 vaccination trends to be “wildly uneven and unfair.” He pointed out that while only 10 countries account for as much as three-fourths of all the vaccines that have already been administered, more than a hundred other countries, like the Philippines, have yet to receive a single dose.\n",
      "In late January this year, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) reported that of the 12.5 billion doses that the main vaccine producers have pledged for 2021, 6.4 billion were pre-ordered mostly by high-income countries. Having purchased such high volumes, richer countries like Canada and the United Kingdom could reportedly inoculate their entire populations many times over.\n",
      "One article in the South China Morning Post put it succinctly: “If the big problem of 2020 was the coronavirus, the big one of 2021 is shaping up to be vaccine inequality.” Leaving this issue unaddressed will surely prolong the pandemic and the economic recovery. In fact, a study commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce Research Foundation even estimated that vaccine inequality could cost the global economy up to US$9.2 trillion.\n",
      "Of course, this is where the COVAX facility of the World Health Organization (WHO) comes in, as it aims to provide every country — especially the ones with limited resources — with doses to inoculate at least 20 percent of their populations.By and large however, low-income countries will still need to fight tooth and nail to purchase the doses they need, or attract donations from other countries.Having fallen behind, they will still be hard-pressed to scrounge up the resources, hasten the procurement process, and ensure the unhampered delivery and distribution of vaccines.\n",
      "The National COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act — which we recently sponsored, and which both Houses of Congress passed upon certification by the President — aims to provide some solutions to this problem.\n",
      "For one, it provides legal cover for our Local Government Units (LGUs) and private entities to procure and even make advance payments for vaccines and ancillary supplies and services, subject to certain conditions.By enabling LGUs and private entities this way, wefree up even more resources to purchase vaccines.While there is roughly ₱82.5 billion that has been appropriated in 2021 for our national COVID-19 immunization program, we are adding more to this fund by allowing LGUs and companies to use whatever resources they have to purchase vaccines and the related supplies.\n",
      "In fact, based on a survey and study conducted by the League of Provinces of the Philippines (LPP), 70 LGUs are prepared to spend a little more than ₱13 billion to purchase and administer vaccines — ₱4.392 billion from 32 provinces and ₱8.72 billion from 38 cities and municipalities.Then as of December last year, hundreds of Filipino companies pooled their resources and were able to secure pledges of up to 17 million doses. With revenues down, we will need as much cash as we can to procure and administer vaccines expeditiously.\n",
      "The measure also responds to the issue of indemnification that some vaccine manufacturers have required for their supply agreements.Under the measure, a COVID-19 national indemnity fund — worth ₱500 million to be administered by PhilHealth — will be established for the compensation of any inoculated person who subsequently experiences severe adverse effects or even death. We believe that by putting such terms in black and white, we remove a significant barrier to the signing of a vaccine supply agreement.\n",
      "We’ve also exempted purchases, importations, and donations of COVID-19 vaccines from customs duties, VAT, excise tax, donor’s tax, and other fees and charges. In doing so, we hope to encourage more parties to donate vaccines for the benefit of the public.\n",
      "With the assistance of our Senate colleagues, counterparts in the House, and friends in the academe and the private sector, we were able to pass such an important measure in a short amount of time. We are also thankful that President Duterte has swiftly signed it into law.Sen. Sonny Angara has been in public service for 16 years.He has authored and sponsored more than 200 laws.

      "In a statement on Saturday, February 27, Villanueva expressed confidence that the law will help address the lack of vaccines “and erase the shame of our being last in the ASEAN to get one.”Since the measure increases the number of buyers, removes taxes, relaxes procurement rules, and creates an indemnity fund, “then it will make it easier for government to close vaccine supply deals,” he said.“It will make us competitive in the global vaccine race,” Villanueva added.\n",
      "Duterte on Friday night signed the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act, which aims to expedite the procurement of vaccines through the local government units and private sector. The law, among several others, also includes at least P500 million indemnification fund being requested by some vaccine makers before supplying the country with their products.\n",

      "“Kung meron pong (If there will be) five million vaccine doses before end of March and another 24 million doses then that would only cover 12 percent of the 110 million population at two doses per person. Kaya kulang pa po (That’s why it’s not enough),” he said.“Kung totoo pong meron na (If it’s true that there will be) 161 million doses by the end of the year, well and good. If this bill is what is needed to firm up its delivery, then invoke its provisions,” he added.\n",

      "The World Health Organization has announced that the AstraZeneca vaccine could be given to people aged 65 and over despite concerns about its efficacy, and used in countries where variants of the novel coronavirus have been found.Canada said it will make it available to its citizens aged over 18.It has been found to be about 62 percent effective in preventing infection, compared to more than 90 percent for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that are based on different technology.\n",
      "Already in use in Britain and the European Union, it requires two doses four to 12 weeks apart to offer the best protection, but does not need to be stored in extreme cold temperatures in contrast to the Pfizer vaccine, making its distribution simpler and with a broader reach.\n",
      "Canada started its vaccine rollout in December 2020 but recently faced shortages due to European manufacturing issues, with no production capacity of its own.“Canada is hungry for vaccines,” Health Canada senior advisor Supriya Sharma told a separate media briefing. “We’re putting more on the buffet table.”\n",
      "The department, she added, has concluded “that the benefits outweigh the risks.”\n",
      "As of Friday, Canada has reported more than 858,000 cases of the coronavirus and 21,865 fatalities.\n",
      "Ottawa has ordered or reserved more than 400 million doses of vaccine from seven suppliers for a population of 38 million.\n",
      "The first shipment from the Serum Institute of India is scheduled to arrive within weeks, with the remainder to be delivered over the next couple of months.By the end of March, Trudeau said, Ottawa expects to receive a total of 6.5 million Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccine doses, and tens of millions more in April and June — getting back on track to a stated target of inoculating all Canadians by September.

      "The US will begin in mid-March a clinical trial of a version of Moderna’s COVID vaccine specific to the South Africa variant, Anthony Fauci, the top advisor to the White House on the pandemic, said Friday.The Phase 1 trial will involve 210 people to study both the immune response generated by the vaccine and its safety, he said.\n",
      "Unlike previous trials there will be no placebo, and instead the experiment will look at various combinations of the new vaccine and the old, both in people who were previously vaccinated and in people who have never before been vaccinated.\n",
      "The goal is to determine how well the different strategies compare in their ability to neutralize the B.1.351 strain, which has been shown to partly reduce the effectiveness of the current generation of vaccines.\n",
      "Carrying out the early-stage trial “does not necessarily mean a commitment to make 300 million, or 600, million doses of this vaccine,” said Fauci.“This is all going to depend on the dynamics of the outbreak and what other variants might be dominant.”\n",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said earlier this week that variant-specific COVID vaccines would likely not need to go through the same level of clinical testing that the first versions did before they receive authorization. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "A US panel of independent experts voted unanimously Friday in favor of recommending Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose COVID-19 shot for emergency approval, clearing the way for a third vaccine to soon begin shipping in the world’s hardest hit country.\n",
      "The committee’s 22 members were convened by the Food and Drug Administration and included leading scientists as well as consumer and industry representatives.\n",
      "Although their recommendations aren’t binding, they are usually followed.An emergency use authorization (EUA) will likely follow, probably in the coming days, making the J&J vaccine the third to be greenlighted in the United States after Pfizer’s and Moderna’s were provisionally approved in December.\n",
      "“We’ve all seen the news about (the) Johnson and Johnson vaccine today — (the) third, safe effective vaccine,” President Joe Biden said from Houston shortly after the vote.\n",
      "“We’re going to use every conceivable way to expand manufacturing of the vaccine… and make even more rapid progress in getting (shots) to people’s arms.”\n",
      "Administration officials said this week they hoped to deliver three to four million doses next week.The recommendation followed a day-long, live-streamed virtual meeting to decide if the known benefits of the drug outweigh its known risks for use in people aged 18 and over — which gave the public an inside look at the details of the scientific debate.\n",
      "“Janssen’s vaccine candidate will play a critical role in the global efforts to fight COVID-19,” Johan Van Hoof, global head of vaccines research and development at J&J’s Janssen subsidiary, had told the meeting, emphasizing the shot’s high efficacy against severe COVID-19, including against new variants.\n",
      "He also stressed the fact that it was proven to work with a single shot, and could be stored long term at fridge temperatures, which “offers logistical and practical advantages.”– Placebo crossover –In a global trial of almost 40,000 people, the vaccine’s efficacy against severe disease was 85.4 percent, but it fell to 66.1 percent when including moderate forms of the disease.\n",
      "This makes it slightly less protective than Pfizer and Moderna’s two-shot regimens, which both have an efficacy of around 95 percent against symptomatic COVID-19.\n",
      "Nevertheless, experts say J&J’s shot will bring to bear a powerful new weapon against the outbreak in the United States, where more than 500,000 people have died.\n",
      "Van Hoof said that if authorized, J&J would apply to amend their trials so that people who received the placebo could now receive the vaccine.The idea is to compare relative efficacy between people who were vaccinated earlier against later, to see if immunity wanes over time.The company is also planning to soon begin testing its vaccine on children.\n",
      "It is separately studying whether two doses might be more protective than one — which raised concerns among some panelists who felt people who got one dose might feel short-changed if two doses ends up proving more effective.\n",
      "– Anaphylaxis case –\n",
      "During J&J’s presentation, company scientist Macaya Douoguih revealed that a case of anaphylaxis occurred in a health worker in South Africa — the first time this has happened for the shot.Some rare anaphylaxis cases have been reported for the Pfizer and Moderna shots.In almost 44,000 people studied for safety issues, the vaccine was well tolerated, with typical side-effects like injection-site pain, headache, fatigue and muscle pains.\n",
      "There were a handful of cases of people who developed hives, which could have been linked to the shot.The FDA also said long-term monitoring was needed to determine whether the vaccine was linked to a small number of cases of potentially dangerous clotting, and to tinnitus (ear ringing).\n",
      "Seven people died from COVID-19 in the placebo group, and none in the vaccine group.\n",
      "There was a hint, based on preliminary data, that the vaccine might be partly effective against asymptomatic infection.\n",
      "The company has announced it aims to deliver a total of 20 million doses to the United States by the end of March, with 100 million by June — though the US is pushing to expedite that timeline.\n",
      "The J&J vaccine uses a common-cold causing adenovirus, which has been genetically modified so that it can’t replicate, to carry the gene for a key protein of the coronavirus into human cells.Those cells then produce that protein, which in turn trains the human immune system should it encounter the real virus.

      "“The vaccination of our soldiers will start as soon as the vaccines are aready available,” he said.\n",
      "After the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Sinovac with an emergency use authorization last Monday, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana bared that around 100,000 doses of the vaccines were donated by China to the Department of National Defense through Chinese Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe.\n",
      "Of the donated vaccines, Arevalo said 50,000 doses will be administered to the soldiers while the remaining doses will go to other priorities of the government.Aside from this, Arevalo said the AFP is also awaiting confirmation if it be given a portion of the 500,000 vaccine donations earlier promised by the Chinese government. The commitment was made by Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi through Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. back in January.\n",

      "Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) (MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“We, at the Armed Forces of the Philippines, are ready. Our Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, is focused on ensuring that the military is ready to fulfill its supporting roles once the rollout begins,” said Major Gen. Edgard Arevalo at a Laging Handa press briefing.\n",
      "The first batch of the COVID-19 vaccines is set to arrive from abroad on Sunday, Feb. 28.The AFP will play three supporting roles in the government’s national vaccination program to eliminate the threat of COVID-19, according to Arevalo.\n",
      "These roles include ensuring the overall peace and security situation during the vaccination program, the lending of military medical personnel in areas where additional manpower is needed, and logistical support in transporting the vaccines from the cold storage facilities to the designated vaccine sites.\n",
      "Arevalo also noted that Sobejana gave an order to vaccinate all of the 120,000-strong military personnel so they can fulfill their duties to help the government in the vaccination program.\n",
      "“We do not want our personnel to be the carriers of the virus and bring the disease to our countrymen whom we want to serve,” he said.To inoculate all of its personnel, the AFP created 72 vaccination teams and identified 47 vaccination sites within military camps that have treatment facilities. Twenty-seven vaccination sites have already acquired an authorization from the Department of Health (DOH) while 20 more are awaiting the go signal.\n",
      "Of these, a total of 12 are located in Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), Region 1, Region 2, and Region 3, and are managed by the Northern Luzon Command (NoLCom); eight in Metro Manila, supervised by the Joint Task Force National Capital Region (JTF-NCR); 10 in Region 4A and Region 5, under the command of Southern Luzon Command (SoLCom); two in Region 4B, under the Western Command (WesCom), and six in Region 6, Region 7, and Region 8, under the Central Command (CentCom).\n",
      "There are also a total of five vaccination sites in Region 9 and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), under the command of the Western Mindanao Command (WesMinCom); and four sites in Region 10 and Region 11, under the Eastern Mindanao Command (EastMinCom).We aim to inoculate 100 personnel per day,” Arevalo said.\n",
      "Meanwhile, military camps which have no treatment facilities are directed to coordinate with the local government units and DOH offices for the establishment of a vaccination site.\n",
      "It is likely that the Coronavac vaccine made by Chinese firm Sinovac will be used in inoculating the military personnel, Arevalo said.\n",
      "He said the vaccination will be free of charge for all military personnel. However, he reiterated that soldiers will have to pay if they opt for another brand of vaccine.\n",

      "(NOEL CELIS / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) has agreed to recommend the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine for medical frontliners.\n",
      "“The DOH, FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and our panel of experts concur that the current available evidence is enough to establish that the vaccine is safe for use,” Vergeire said in a press briefing.“After a thorough discussion, our NITAG experts have concluded that the vaccine will be beneficial for the healthcare workers,” she added.\n",
      "Based on the clinical trial data of the Sinovac vaccine, it was shown that the vaccine is “50 percent effective in preventing mild symptoms, and 100 percent effective against moderate to severe symptoms,” said Vergeire, adding that the data also shows that it is effective in “reducing morbidity and mortality.”\n",
      "“Given this evidence, the NITAG has deemed it sufficient to recommend the use of the vaccine for healthcare workers as it bears to reiterate that our goal for prioritizing healthcare workers for vaccination is to reduce morbidity and mortality among their group while we maintain the most critical essential health services,” said the DOH spokesperson.Right to refuseHealthcare workers have the right to refuse the Sinovac vaccineand wait for the arrival of other vaccine brands, said the health experts.\n",
      "“We like to emphasize again that vaccination with the incoming Sinovac donation is voluntary and we’d like to give the right of refusal after informed choice to our healthcare workers because they deserve it,” said Dr. Nina Carandang, health social scientist and professor of the College of Medicine at the University of the Philippines-Manila.\n",
      "“If they want to give their slot for this particular Sinovac vaccine and wait for the next vaccine to arrive in the country, that is their personal decision and it is not mandatory for them to accept this particular Sinovac vaccine,” she added.It is only right that the healthcare workers be given the choice, said Dr. Edsel Salvana, a member of the DOH Technical Advisory Group.“I think it is completely appropriate that we be given the first choice whether we are going to take this vaccine that’s already available or if we want to wait. But at the same time, based on the data, this vaccine looks like it will save lives and so I think, it is right that we offer it to the people who have been on the frontlines, who have been saving lives,” he said.\n",
      "“If they feel that it is not the right vaccine for them, then we are not going to penalize them, they are still first in line either for Pfizer or Astra[Zeneca]. But as for myself,a healthcare worker who sees covid patients, I’m willing to take this vaccine,” he added.\n",
      "Carandang encouraged healthcare workers to get vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine.\n",
      "“We like to offer this opportunity for healthcare workers if they are willing to do so to have themselves vaccinated with Sinovac. If they don’t feel that this is not the best vaccine for them, given their risk benefit analysis for themselves, then they can still wait for the other brands of vaccines – but unfortunately we don’t know yet: what is the current status of the negotiations and what is the actual delivery date of the (other) vaccines. So that is the tricky part that you have to look at,” she said.“You may not like the current brand available, but if you think that your risk is high at this point in time because of patient care duties and exposure in the community, then you also have to think about how much worth it is for you to actually have the Sinovac vaccine because we don’t know yet as to when the next vaccines of whatever brand are coming into the country,” she added.\n",
      "Carandang, meanwhile, expressed hope that the country can secure other vaccine brands soon.\n",
      "“We hope that we will be able to procure our own set of other vaccines from the other brands soon,” she said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Dominguez, upon the recommendation of Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko, also allowed COVID-19 vaccine importers to use the Tax Exemption System (TES) Online Filing Module in processing their shipments.According to Dominguez, these regulatory relief measures aim ”to further support the government’s rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program.”“COVID-19 vaccine tax exemption applications in the Mabuhay Lane, which is under the DOF’s Revenue Office, will be processed within 24 working hours,” the department said.\n",
      "These tax exemption policies will be incorporated in the inter-agency guidelines on the implementation of a One-Stop Shop for International Donations and Government Procured COVID-19 Vaccines.\n",
      "The inter-agency guidelines are being prepared by the DOF, Department of Health, Department of Foreign Affairs, Bureau of Customs, and the Food and Drug Administration.\n",
      "Tionko, who heads the DOF’s Revenue Operations Group, recommended the inclusion in the Mabuhay Lane of COVID-19 vaccine imports, “regardless of the applicable legal basis,” to “allow for the expedited processing of the tax and exemption of such applications.”Under DOF Department Order No. 54-2000, the Secretary of Finance is authorized to include additional sectors that may avail of the express service under the Mabuhay Lane.“We add that the Mabuhay Lane currently processes all Relief Consignment under Section 120 in relation to 121 of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA). The Lane is expected to process all COVID-19 vaccines which may qualify as relief consignment,” Tionko said.Relief Consignment refers to goods donated to national government agencies and accredited private entities for free distribution to, or for the use of, victims of calamities.Under Section 121 of the CMTA, relief consignment imported during a state of calamity and intended for the use of calamity victims shall be exempted from the payment of duties and taxes.Created on May 13, 1994 through DO 29-94, the Mabuhay Lane is tasked to expeditiously process applications for the tax and duty exemption of certain groups of importers, which include export-oriented firms, returning residents and non-profit, non-stock educational institutions.

      "The failure to secure the vaccines for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) until now has forced the Philippine government to offer to buy the doses for a higher price just to ensure early delivery, a top official said.\n",
      "Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 (NTF AGAINST COVID-19 / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Retired military chief of staff Carlito Galvez, vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19), said they are now negotiating with vaccine manufacturers for the delivery of the first batch of the vaccines by next month or the second quarter of this year.\n",
      "“This is the technique that we are doing, we are offsetting their price. We are negotiating to pay a little to ensure the early delivery,” Galvez told President Duterte in Filipino during a briefing.The negotiations for the procurement of vaccine for the Philippines was early but Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin later disclosed that ‘somebody dropped the ball’ which resulted in the failure to secure the vaccine. Health Secretary Francisco Duque, however, denied that he ‘dropped the ball’.\n",
      "Galvez then took the lead in securing the vaccine and the optimism went to the point that government officials declared that the vaccination roll-out would be on February 15. Dry-runs were conducted involving various government agencies that include transportation of the vaccines and even the vaccination proper.\n",
      "But still, no vaccines arrived amid the vaccination roll-out of some countries that include Myanmar, Bangladesh and even conflict-torn Afghanistan.\n",
      "It was later found out that the negotiations were bungled anew over failure to produce an indemnification agreement which manufacturers have been reportedly asking even from other countries.Vaccination roll-out for the Philippines is expected to begin once China’s donation for 600,000 doses of the controversial Sinovac arrives. Galvez said the China donation is set to arrive next month.\n",
      "Galvez explained that delay and the low supply of doses for the first two quarters of this year was caused by the high global demand for COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "But he said some 24 million doses of vaccines are expected to arrive in the country by second quarter, including the ones ordered by the Philippine government from Pfizer and Astrazenica.“The main volume of the procurement will arrive in the third and fourth quarter (2021) so the major vaccination roll-out really will be coming from the third and fourth quarter,” said Galvez.

      "The single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine is highly effective in preventing severe COVID-19, including newer variants, according to documents released by the US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday.\n",
      "Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine requires only one shot and can be stored at regular fridge temperatures, giving it an operational advantage over the Pfizer and Moderna jabs\n",
      "The news came as the regulator was set to convene an independent panel Friday that will likely vote to authorize the vaccine, making it the third available in the country hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "In large clinical trials, the J&J vaccine’s efficacy against severe disease was 85.9 percent in the United States, 81.7 percent in South Africa, and 87.6 percent in Brazil.Overall, among 39,321 participants across all regions, the efficacy against severe COVID-19 was 85.4 percent, but it fell to 66.1 percent when including moderate forms of the disease.\n",
      "Crucially, analyses of different demographic groups revealed no marked differences across age, race, or people with underlying conditions.\n",
      "The vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with no reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), which have been seen in rare cases for the Pfizer and Moderna shots.Mild to moderate reactions, like injection-site pain, headache, fatigue and muscle pains were more likely to occur in younger participants than older.There were no reported deaths in the vaccine group, but five in the placebo group.\n",
      "“The analysis supported a favorable safety profile with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA (emergency use authorization),” the FDA wrote.\n",
      "White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters that if authorized, the federal government would seek to distribute three to four million doses next week.\n",
      "“Johnson and Johnson has announced it aims to deliver a total of 20 million doses by the end of March,” he continued, adding the government was trying to speed up the delivery of the contracted 100 million doses, which the company has promised by the end of June.\n",
      "– One dose, fridge storage –\n",
      "A third vaccine is seen as a vital means to ramp up the immunization rate in the United States, where more than 500,000 people have lost their lives to the coronavirus.Some 65 million people in America have so far received at least one shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines — but unlike those, the J&J vaccine requires just one dose, and is stored at fridge temperatures.\n",
      "The trade-off is slightly less protection against mild or moderate forms of COVID-19.\n",
      "“The vaccine was effective in preventing COVID-19 using a less restrictive definition of the disease and for more severe disease, including COVID-19 requiring medical intervention, considering all cases starting 14 days after vaccination,” the FDA wrote in its briefing document.“Although a lower efficacy overall was observed in South Africa, where there was a predominance of B.1.3.5 lineage during the time period of this study, vaccine efficacy against severe/critical COVID-19 was similarly high across the United States, South Africa, and Brazil,” it added.\n",
      "There was a hint, based on preliminary data, that the vaccine might be effective against asymptomatic infection.\n",
      "But “this finding needs to be further investigated with additional data,” wrote the company in a separate document made available by the FDA.\n",
      "The J&J vaccine uses a common-cold causing adenovirus, which has been modified so that it can’t replicate, to carry the DNA for a key protein of the coronavirus into human cells.This makes those cells produce that protein, which in turn trains the human immune system should it encounter the real virus.\n",

      "The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has proven 94 percent effective in a study involving 1.2 million people in Israel, the first peer-reviewed real world research confirming the power of mass immunization campaigns to bring the pandemic to a close.\n",

      "The paper, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, also demonstrated there is likely a strong protective benefit against infection, a crucial element in breaking onward transmission.\n",
      "“The fact that the vaccines worked so well in the real world… really does suggest that if the nations of the world can find the will, we now have the means to end COVID-19 forever,” said Ben Neuman, a virologist from Texas A&M University who was not involved in the research.\n",
      "ADVERTISINGThe experiment was carried out between December 20 2020 and February 1, 2021 — a period when a newer variant first identified in Britain was rampant in Israel, making the vaccine’s performance all the more impressive.\n",
      "Around 1.2 million people were divided into equal groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated.\n",
      "Each vaccinated participant was matched to an unvaccinated “control” person of similar age, sex, geographic, medical and other characteristics.Lead author Noam Barda, head of epidemiology and research at the Clalit Research Institute, told AFP the matching process was highly robust.An elderly Ultra-Orthodox Jewish man from a particular neighborhood with a particular set of comorbidities and flu vaccination history would be matched for another person fitting that precise profile, for example.\n",
      "The researchers then recorded outcomes at days 14-20 after the first of the two doses and day seven or more after the second.\n",
      "The efficacy against symptomatic infections was 57 percent between 14-20 days after the first dose, but rose to 94 percent seven days after the second dose — very close to the 95 percent achieved during Phase 3 clinical trials.\n",
      "People who received second doses were also highly protected against hospitalization and death — though the precise numbers here are less significant and had a wider statistical range because of the relatively lower number of cases.\n",
      "The study also found people who received their second dose had a 92 percent lower chance of getting any form of infection at all compared to those who were unvaccinated.\n",
      "While this finding was considered encouraging, the researchers and outside experts said it needs more confirming evidence.\n",
      "That’s because the participants weren’t being systematically tested at regular intervals; rather, they were getting a test when they wanted one.The authors attempted to correct for this with statistical methods but the result is still likely imperfect.“Unless you are testing everyone all the time, this will miss some infections,” said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida.She added she was certain there was a strong protective benefit, but “nailing down this number more precisely will require specialized study designs with frequent testing.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

So, maghintay tayo (The 130 countries have none yet so let’s just wait),” Duterte said during his televised address Wednesday, Feb. 24.While majority of the countries still awaited for supply, Duterte said even the United States and Canada were fighting over vaccine supply.\n",
      "“Canada nga na kapitbahay ng Amerika nagdadamutan pa sila. Kino-corner talaga ng Amerika lahat ngayon kasi they have about 270 million people…332 million (Canada and United States are neighbors but are being selfish. America has really cornered all because they have about 332 million),” he added.\n",
      "Pending the arrival of the vaccines, the President urged anew the public to observe health protocols, most especially wearing masks to avoid getting infected. Duterte showed his white face mask, saying it can save people “a lot of trouble and expense.”\n",
      "“I’m not trying to, I said, pontificate here. Iyong in the meantime, you just better follow government at iwasan…Iyong — iyong mask, ito. Ito it can save you a lot of trouble and expense. Simple lang ito (This is simple),” he said.United Nations Secretary António Guterres recently found unfair that around 10 countries have control over the majority of the vaccine supply. The UN chief lamented that vaccine equity was the “biggest moral test” before the international community.\n",
      "In the Philippines, the government expects to receive 161 million doses of coronavirus by the end of the year. The supply delivery has been hampered by indemnity and regulatory requirements as well as supply challenges.\n",
      "The first batch of doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by China is expected to be delivered to the country this Sunday.In the meeting the President and other Cabinet members, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. admitted that the country has a thin COVID-19 supply line this first quarter.\n",
      "Citing “indicative delivery of vaccines,” Galvez said around 3.5 million doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines through the World Health Organization’s COVAX facility. An additional 600,000 donated doses will be coming from China.\n",
      "Galvez added there will be a procurement by the Department of Health of 1 million doses by March.\n",
      "“Talagang manipis tayo sa first quarter. Ang total niyan is 5.1 million (We will have a thin supply this first quarter. The total will only be 5.1 million),” he told the President.\n",
      "Galvez said they are negotiating for more vaccine supplies from the United Kingdom, China, Russia, India for first quarter. He said it was imperative to vaccinate around 1.7 million health care workers as well as seniors and other vulnerable citizens.“Ito ang medyo talagang malaking problema natin dahil sa global demand, napakababa ng ating supply sa first quarter (This is really our big problem because due to global demand, we have a very low supply in the first quarter),” he said.\n",
      "By the second quarter, Galvez said the country could expect 24.1 million doses of coronavirus vaccines, that includes 6 million jabs from COVAX facility. The main volume of supplies is expected to arrive in the country by third and fourth quarter of the year.\n",
      "With these forthcoming supplies, he said the country’s major vaccine rollout will occur in second half of the year. He said they are trying to negotiate an early delivery of the supplies from the vaccine manufacturers even at a higher cost.\n",
      "“We are expecting to receive 161 million doses by the end of 2021,” he said.\n",
      "Galvez also informed the President that they are “polishing” three supply agreements with drug manufacturers in terms of indemnity and delivery.\n",
      "The country has so far secured 17 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines after advance payments were made by the private sector and the local government units. Galvez said he also conducted marathon negotiations with Moderna Wednesday morning to finalize the language of the supply agreement.\n",
      "He said vaccine manufacturers have asked for a “full blanket” indemnity in the supply deals but the government could not agree with such request. The vaccine makers should still maintain “good manufacturing practices” to ensure the protection of vaccine recipients, he said.\n",
      "He noted that the government cannot fully waive immunity especially in case of malpractice and willful neglect in the vaccination. He insisted that the government has a duty to protect public safety and health. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“Once you use government funds (to purchase), it will definitely pass the scrutiny of state auditors,” Cua said during an online press briefing, when asked if there is a need for a special audit on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.The Senate on Tuesday approved on third and final reading Senate Bill No. 2057 which allows local government units (LGUs) to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport and distribution.\n",

      "British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce on Wednesday said they have no plans to link the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccines to the deployment of Filipino health care workers in the United Kingdom.\n",
      "This was in response to an earlier proposal made by Labor and Employment Secretary Silvestre Bello III offering Germany and the UK of deploying more nurses to those countries in exchange for providing the Philippines with some 600,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“We’ve got no plans to link the vaccines with those conversations around the recruitment of nurses,” Pruce told reporters during a virtual press briefing.\n",
      "The British diplomat admitted that the proposal to trade the vaccine for the lifting of the deployment cap for Filipinos health care workers (HCWs) abroad was raised by Bello himself during their last conversation a few weeks ago “in the midst of the number of points that we were also exchanging views on.”\n",
      "While they understand the basis upon which the Philippines’ offer came given the demands of the pandemic, the British diplomat explained the hiring of Filipino HCWs is being done based on their government’s policy decision in terms of managing the flow of health care professionals.\n",
      "On the vaccine distribution, Pruce said the UK has made an emphatic commitment that any vaccine excess that it may have in the course of their vaccine deployment plan will be directed through the COVAX facility.\n",
      "COVAX facility is the mechanism launched by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission and France to ensure that people in all corners of the world will get access to COVID-19 vaccines once they are available, regardless of their wealth.\n",
      "Early this month, it was announced that the COVAX has allotted the Philippines 10 million vaccine doses, mostly the Astra Zeneca brand, but will be delivered on an installment basis. Pruce said the COVAX vaccine allocations to countries, including the Philippines, will be done in a “fair and equitable” manner.“And it will be through COVAX facility that distribution of surplus vaccines through developing countries will be managed in a fair and equitable way,” he said.

      "He also directed the NBI “to file the appropriate charges against all persons involved and found responsible for any unlawful act in connection therewith.”Guevarra’s directive was following revelations made by Presidential Security Group (PSG) Commander Brig.

      "Locsin’s comment came in the wake of reports that Bello has conveyed to both Germany and the UK governments that the Philippines is willing to grant exemption from the deployment cap of Filipino health care workers should they agree to the vaccine request.Also part of Bello’s offer is the renewal of previous bilateral agreements with the two countries that cover the protection of Filipino workers.Bello, according to the report, had informed Germany and the UK that the Philippine government may exempt them from the deployment cap if they would agree to the agency’s requests, which include the renewal of previous bilateral agreements protecting OFWs.\n",
      "The issue of placing a cap on Filipino nurses and HCWs seeking jobs abroad came to the fore at the height of the pandemic last year when the Philippines implemented a deployment restriction, especially on nurses to ensure a sufficient supply of health care professionals in the country. Demand for healthcare workers has increased over the years in some European countries and even in Japan due to their aging population.Meanwhile, the Philippine Nurses Association (PNA) called on the government to include the nurses in their negotiations with the labor-receiving countries to ensure that their welfare and interests are amply protected.PNA President Melbert Reyes also cautioned the government not to make it appear that Filipino nurses and health care workers are “mere commodities” that could be traded in exchange for the vaccines.“We would like to be part (of the negotiation). If there is such negotiation, there should be policies and guidelines to protect our nurses because we cannot just trade or send them in those countries,” Reyes told the Manila Bulletin in an interview.\n",
      "If carefully handled, Reyes said the offer of Bello could turn out to be a “win-win” situation for the Philippines since it would be able to help the country hasten its vaccination program that has been delayed already.He likewise appealed to the government to put the nurses and other healthcare workers on the vaccine’s priority list.\n",
      "“Of course we are concerned with our members. We are the frontliners and in direct contact with the patients,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The city chief executive announced this as the country has yet to start its own COVID-19 vaccination program.\n",
      "She said the local government opted to secure its own supply of COVID-19 vaccines in case the national government fails to deliver on its commitment to make the vaccines available for all.\n",
      "She said the initial doses of AZD1222, the vaccine jointly developed by the British firm with Oxford University, can can benefit 15,000 individuals.Duterte added that they will procure additional vaccines developed by US-based Novavax Inc. and Serum Institute of India after receiving information that the local government units in the country can now place orders with the vaccine manufacturer.\n",
      "“We are starting our documentation right now to buy a certain number of doses of Novavax. We’re buying these vaccines just in case the national government will not fulfill its commitment that there will be vaccines for all because there’s nothing on paper yet with regard to the number of doses that they can give to the LGUs,” she said.Duterte added that the city has been allocated an initial supply of 15,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccines that the national government will receive through the COVAX Facility, benefiting 7,500 individuals.\n",
      "She said the local government is also asking private hospitals that serve as COVID-19 referral facilities in the city to submit names of their health care workers, who are willing to receive the vaccines, as the initial supply will be more than enough to cover all workers of the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC), which has around 5,000 employees.Duterte said the city’s public and private hospitals catering to COVID-19 patients have around 12,000 to 13,000 frontline healthcare workers, excluding those employed in standalone laboratories and allied medical services, who need to get vaccinated.The health care workers are at top of the government priority list for COVID-19 vaccination program, she said.

      "Senator Richard Gordon has urged the Senate to make sure that the bill seeking to expedite the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines will allow the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) to also procure them.\n",
      "Senator Richard Gordon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Gordon said Senate Bill No. 2057 or the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 should also cover international human organizations like the PRC, to ensure that the most vulnerable would be inoculated.\n",
      "The senator, who is also chairman of the PRC, said the COVID-19 vaccines that would be procured by the organization would be administered also to individuals consistent with the government’s priority list set.“The idea is for them to get it from the Red Cross if we can get it, but they will have to donate one is to one. If they get one vaccine, they will donate one vaccine to the most vulnerable,” Gordon said.\n",
      "“So, if they get 2,000 vaccines, they give us 2,000, which we can now distribute in accordance with the government plan to add to those who need it. This will now add more depth to our supply of vaccines and at the same time, expand it and make it faster,” he said, in proposing amendments to Section 5 of the bill.\n",
      "Gordon also proposed that the Department of Health (DOH), the National Task Force against COVID-19 (NTF), local government units (LGUs), and private entities procuring COVID-19 vaccines may partner with the PRC in the administration or distribution, and inoculation of the vaccines.\n",
      "He noted that, subject to certain conditions, the current Section 5 allows private entities to procure only in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through a multiparty agreement with the said agencies and the vaccine supplier.Under the bill, vaccines purchased by private entities shall also be for the sole and exclusive use of such companies, without prejudice to the multiparty agreement. Angara, author and sponsor of Senate Bill 2057, had agreed to study Gordon’s proposal. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte (QC PIO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“I would be lying to say that I’m not frustrated with the delay. We have already planned our vaccination program… We are very, very ready. Kulang na nga lang yung bakuna (What we just need is the vaccine),” Belmonte said in an interview with ANC Tuesday.\n",
      "Belmonte made the remark as the arrival of vaccine was delayed due to the national government’s late submission of required indemnification agreement to vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and AstraZeneca and the late emergency authorization to Sinovac.Because of this, the Quezon City government now has to adjust its “calendar,” which initially aimed to achieve herd immunity by vaccinating 80 percent of the population or around 1.6 million people within six to eight months.\n",
      "“We estimated a time of about six to eight months to achieve this [herd immunity]… Certainly, with this delay, and of course given the fact that Sinovac will not applicable to our health workers and to our senior citizens, I think this will require us again to change our vaccine program and shuffle it around,” the mayor said.\n",
      "Belmonte added that aside from its calendar, the delay also affected the local governments’ bid to reopen the economy as “the riskiest population should be vaccinated first before we can really go about opening the economy.”\n",
      "If Sinovac, which is still not recommended to health workers and senior citizens, will arrive first, “that means we will have to start with the non-so vulnerable sectors like the working essential workers,” Belmonte said.“But these are not really the one we should be protecting. It is the health workers and our senior citizens,” she said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Sen. Risa Hontiveros made the appeal after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not recommend Sinovac for health workers, even though it has given the China-made vaccines an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n",
      "Sinovac is also scheduled to arrive in the country as the first vaccine against COVID-19.The NTF, Hontiveros said, should still stick to the vaccination program as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) by speeding up the purchase agreements of vaccines that are effective for healthcare workers given their high exposure to COVID-19.\n",

      "On February 17, 2021, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended a virtual UN Security Council Ministerial Open Briefing on COVID-19 Vaccine Issue in Beijing, and delivered a speech entitled “Strengthening Global Anti-pandemic Cooperation with a People-centered Approach”.\n",
      "Wang Yi said, in the past seven months since the Security Council passed Resolution 2532 calling for a global ceasefire and stepping up efforts to fight the pandemic, more than 180 countries have endorsed the global ceasefire initiative, and the situation in Libya, Sudan and other countries has made significant progress, contributing to the international fight against the pandemic. Meanwhile, a new round of the pandemic is still spreading, and the vast majority of developing countries, especially countries caught in conflict and those affected by humanitarian crises, are facing difficult situations. We must redouble our efforts to make new contributions to fighting the pandemic and maintaining peace. Wang Yi put forward four points in this regard:\n",
      "First, put people first and strengthen international cooperation against COVID-19. In the face of the pandemic, there is no principle more important than putting people first, and no other consideration that is given higher priority to than putting people’s lives first. This is a relay race to save lives together, not a zero-sum game in which one gains at the expense of the other. All countries should replace division with unity, and firmly follow the right path of cooperating to fight the pandemic and overcome difficulties together; replace prejudice with science, and combat all kinds of false information and attempts to politicize the pandemic. Security Council members must set an example in this regard.Second, fully implement Security Council resolutions and create an environment conducive to the fight against the pandemic. All parties to the conflict must earnestly abide by Security Council Resolution 2532, stay away from the battlefield, and participate in the battle against the pandemic. We should ensure humanitarian access, and give priority to helping vulnerable groups such as women and children. The UN should make good use of the ceasefire window, actively mediate and promote the political settlement process. China has always opposed unilateral sanctions that are not authorized by the Security Council and urges relevant countries to demonstrate humanitarianism and at least suspend unilateral coercive measures that are not based on international law.\n",
      "Third, address the vaccine deficit and increase assistance to developing countries. The COVID-19 vaccine is being developed and produced at a record speed, but there are also problems that urgently need to be resolved. First, “capacity deficit”. For vaccines that have been used for emergencies and have received conditional marketing authorization, countries should not only rely on their own strength to increase the supply, but also actively carry out international cooperation such as commissioned production and joint production. Second, “access deficit”. Vaccines are entering high-income countries quickly and in large numbers, while poor countries have little access. This will not only lead to the “immunization gap” but also aggravate the “development gap”. All parties should come together to reject vaccine nationalism, promote fair and reasonable deployment of vaccines, and in particular, make them accessible and affordable for developing countries, including those in conflicts, so as not to let a country in need be left behind or let any people waiting for the vaccine be forgotten.\n",
      "Fourth, strengthen overall coordination and give full play to the role of the UN system. All parties should continue to increase their political support and financial input to the World Health Organization (WHO), and in particular support the WHO to lead this largest immunization campaign in human history. The “COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility” (COVAX) should fully embody the principle of giving priority to developing countries and ensure the supply of conflict areas and sanctioned countries. The World Food Program, United Nations Children’s Fund, and other international organizations should build a green channel for the distribution of vaccines to developing countries, especially the “last kilometer” in Africa.\n",
      "Wang Yi said, President Xi Jinping solemnly declared to the world that China’s vaccines will be a global public good, making China’s contribution to the realization of the availability and affordability of vaccines in developing countries. China has delivered on its commitments, and first joins the WHO-sponsored Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator initiative, actively develops vaccine R&D cooperation with over 10 countries, and joins and supports the COVAX to promote fair deployment of vaccines with practical actions. At the request of the WHO, China decided to provide 10 million doses of domestic vaccine to the COVAX to meet the urgent needs of developing countries. China has provided vaccine assistance to 53 developing countries that have made requests, and has exported vaccines to 22 countries. China actively leverages its advantages in the industrial chain to support and assist other countries in processing and producing vaccine products in China or locally to help increase global production capacity. China has decided to join the Friends of the COVID-19 Vaccine Group for peacekeepers and donate vaccines to UN peacekeepers.Wang Yi emphasized, China has never pursued any geopolitical goals in its international cooperation on the COVID-19 vaccine, never calculated any economic benefits, and never attached any political conditions. What we think about the most is to make vaccines public goods that are accessible and affordable to people in all countries, and make them truly become a people’s vaccine. China will continue to work with all parties to strengthen cooperation in vaccines, prevention and control and other fields, contribute to a global community of health for all, and win the final victory in the global fight against the pandemic.\n",
      "Under the theme of “ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines in contexts affected by conflict and insecurity”, the meeting was hosted by the United Kingdom, the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council in February.

      "The Public Attorneys Office’s (PAO) mishandling of the Dengvaxia dengue vaccine case contributed to the delays in the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccines in the country, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said on Monday.\n",
      "Senator Franklin Drilon\n",
      "(Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Drilon pointed out that the requirement of vaccine manufacturers for an indemnification clause in the supply agreements for COVID-19 vaccines were borne out of the events that transpired in the Dengvaxia controversy.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez had earlier said manufacturers were seeking an indemnity agreement following news of arrest warrants being issued against Sanofi-Pasteur officials who were responsible in the inoculation of schoolchildren who suffered severe side effects after being vaccinated using the anti-dengue vaccine.“Why, suddenly, the manufacturers required an indemnity clause? Because of their experience on the way the Dengvaxia controversy was handled against Sanofi,” Drilon pointed out during an ANC Headstart interview.\n",
      "“It should be looked at in the context of the way PAO Chief Persida Acosta handled the Dengvaxia controversy,” Drilon added.\n",
      "He noted the PAO chief’s handling of the case burdened the poor health workers who were made defendants in the cases filed all over the country.\n",
      "But given this unfortunate experience, Drilon said it is only proper to include a provision in Senate Bill No. 2057 or the bill expediting the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines that would shield volunteers, like health workers, who are authorized to carry out the inoculation program, from suits and liabilities, except in cases of willful misconduct.He clarified, however, that the free and harmless cause would apply only to vaccines validly procured, not to smuggled vaccines.\n",
      "He also reiterated that the indemnity issue is not the only reason for the delay, citing the mismanagement in the country’s COVID-19 vaccination strategy.\n",
      "“To me, this is not the only reason. I think just like the way COVID-19 pandemic was handled, there is mismanagement in handling the supply agreements,” he stressed. “Even the President asked: where are the vaccines? This is absolutely a sign of exasperation,” Drilon pointed out.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Roque announced Monday that the government will soon begin the immunization program after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the green light for the emergency use of Sinovac vaccines in the country.\n",
      "The Palace admitted there has been a slight delay in the vaccine rollout but he rejected allegations the government bungled the procurement process. He attributed the vaccine delay to issues related to indemnity and regulatory approval.“We obviously disagree,” Roque said during a televised press briefing Monday, Feb. 22, when asked to comment on Senate Majority Franklin Drilon’s statement that the vaccine delay was due to mismanagement.\n",
      "“Anyway, they are entitled to say what they want pero gaya ng aking sinabi sandali lang po ang kaligayahan ng ating mga kritiko dahil tuloy na po ang ating vaccination program (but like I said, the happiness of the critics will be short-lived because our vaccination program will push through). Enjoy it while it lasts for a very short while,” he added.\n",
      "Mismanagement\n",
      "In an interview over ANC Headstart Monday, Drilon said the delay in the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines was reportedly due to the mismanagement of the procurement process and not because of the lack of an indemnity law.\n",
      "“We have to cue and we are last in the cue because of our failure to make an advance payment early enough. These alleged indemnity agreements are not the cause of these delays,” Drilon said.“The fact that this is only foisted to us last week is an indication that the supply agreement is not the cause of the delays. Unfortunately, I have already seen in the media some blame being put on Congress for failing to\n",
      "pass this law. That’s totally unfair,” the minority leader added.\n",
      "“It is the mismanagement of this entire process that caused the delay in our procurement,” he said.\n",
      "Roque said, “‘Yung mga kritiko ng gobyerno, pasensiya na po, talaga pong naantala nang ilang araw pero tuloy na po ang bakuna (To government critics, bear with the slight delay in the vaccine delivery but the vaccination will proceed),” he added.On the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines covered by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) COVAX facility, Roque said the drug manufacturers first wanted an indemnity deal before the supplies are delivered to the country.\n",
      "“Mayroon tayong liham, hindi made-deny ang liham na galing sa COVAX na mid-February darating yung Pfizer at saka AstraZeneca. Kaya lang po may mga natakot na manufacturers dahil dito lang sa Pilipinas nadedemanda ang mga bakuna na naaprubahan hindi lang FDA kung hindi WHO (We received a letter from COVAX facility that stated the delivery of Pfizer and AstraZeneca will begin in mid-February. But the manufacturers got scared because it is only in the Philippines where manufacturers can be sued for vaccines approved not only by (the) FDA but also by (the) WHO),” he said.\n",
      "“Siyempre kailangan nila protektahan ang kanilang interes baka mamaya makulong sila, eh sila na nga gumagawa ng bakuna para sa COVID-19 (Of course, they wanted to protect their interest otherwise they might land in jail even if they developed the vaccines for COVID-19,” he added.\n",

      "(JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "On February 18, President Duterte signed M.O. 51 that allowed the local government units (LGUs) to make advance payments for the acquisition of COVID-19 vaccines that exceeds the 15 percent limit set under procurement laws.The Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Government Procurement Reform Act states that an advance payment “shall be made only after prior approval of the President and shall not exceed 15 percent of the contract amount, unless otherwise directed by the President.”DILG officer-in-charge (OIC) Bernardo C. Florece, Jr.said that this development will ascertain that both the national Task Force (NTF) and the LGUs will speed up the process of securing COVID-19 vaccines for their constituents.He added that M.O. 15 and the possible enactment of House Bill No. 8648 that would allow the importation of COVID-19 vaccines tax free and Senate Bill No.2057 seeking to fast-track the purchase and roll-out of COVID-19 together with the P500-million indemnification fund removes the barriers to the early delivery of vaccines to our country.\n",
      "“M.O. 15 also authorizes the NTF and the Department of Health (DOH) to make advance payments exceeding 15 percent of the total contract amount for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.The said M.O. takes effect immediately after its issuance and will remain until the lifting of the State of Calamity due to COVID-19,’’ stated the DILG.\n",
      "Florece reminded all LGUs that the procurement and payment of vaccines is subject to authorization from NTF COVID-19 chief Implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. as well as “subject to the criteria and limits to be identified by the NTF and Department of Health (DOH) consistent with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.”“We wish to remind the LGUs that all negotiations must follow the tripartite process involving the national government and the pharmaceutical companies they wish to purchase from,” Florece said.\n",
      "Florece warned that “corruption has no place amid the COVID-19 pandemic and all those who will be proven to have engaged in illegal acts will be dealt with under the full power of the law.”SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "For two consecutive weeks, Muntinlupa City held virtual town hall meetings to drum up participation in its forthcoming COVID vaccination program. Invited to the meetings with the theme “Bakunado, Protektado” were representatives of homeowners groups, religious groups, civic groups, Sangguniang Kabataan, the Gender Development Office, and the City Administrator’s Office.\n",
      "During the first meeting held February 10, the resource speakers were Infection Prevention and Control Committee Chair Charissa Borja-Tabora of Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and Jesusa Joyce Cirunay of the Food and Drug Administration. Ms. Borja-Tabora underscored the safety of vaccines, the process of clinical trials, and the role of vaccines in protecting individuals and communities. Ms. Cirunay discussed the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization and the stringent process and policies for the approval of vaccines.During the second meeting held last Thursday, Dr. Jose Mari Castro of the Department of Health shared his insights on the nature of COVID 19, means of transmission and safeguards to protect oneself and the community.\n",
      "A special feature of both town hall meetings was an AVP specially prepared by the Public Information Office, headed by Tez V. Navarro, explaining the need to have oneself vaccinated. The AVP also answered frequently asked questions regarding the safety of FDA-approved vaccines.In a February 11 COVID survey involving 17,561 respondents from Muntinlupa’s nine barangays, 4,484 respondents or 24 percent indicated they were not willing to be vaccinated. The most common reasons cited were fear of side effects, doubts about the efficiency rate of the vaccine, and cost of vaccination, exacerbated obviously by conflicting information circulating in social media.\n",
      "Dr. Teresa “Tet” Tuliao, Muntinlupa City CHO, is targeting 383,000 or 70 percent of the entire city population – the minimum number for Muntinlupeños to be able to gain “herd immunity”.Dr. Tuliao said the city has identified 6,758 medical front-liners from barangay health centers, emergency responders, the Ospital ng Muntinlupa, and six private hospitals, including Asian Hospital, who can inject the vaccines. They will be organized into 82 vaccinations teams and deployed in 35 vaccination posts. They have the capability of vaccinating 8,200 individuals per day.\n",
      "Muntinlupa City will give priority to front-liners such as health workers and uniformed personnel. Next in line are indigent senior citizens, followed by other senior citizens.\n",
      "Vaccination during Spanish times\n",
      "At various periods during the Spanish era, the Philippines was hit by smallpox, bubonic plague, and cholera and it was interesting how the authorities dealt with them.\n",
      "In the 1800s, smallpox infected most of the Spanish territories, in South America and the Philippines. According to historian Ambeth Ocampo, the then reigning Spanish monarch, Carlos IV, ordered a vaccination expedition to head for the territories in 1803. The group was headed by Francisco Javier de Balmis.\n",
      "In the late 1700s, Spain already had a vaccine for smallpox and in fact Carlos IV had his immediate family inoculated. But the problem was how to transport the vaccine because of the long voyage involved. Balmiscame up with the novel idea of using live carriers. From Spain to Mexico and from Mexico to Manila, Balmis used orphans working a relay system. During the voyage, Balmis transmitted the vaccine in sequence, from child to child, arm to arm, along the way to their destination.\n",
      "To cut a long story short, Balmis and his boys eventually reached Manila in 1805. The Spanish Governor-General Rafael Aguilar immediately had his own children inoculated. Thiss oftened the initial resistance of Bishop Domingo Collantes, the Archbishop of Manila, who was not keen on vaccination. Eventually, Balmis inoculated 20,000 inhabitants in Manila and environs. Balmis’ assistants later proceeded to Misamis and Zamboanga. From Manila, Balmis brought Filipino orphans to Macau and Canton for a similar inoculation exercise.\n",
      "A bronze monument of Carlos IV, in front of the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, and a historical marker at the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine commemorate the Balmis vaccination expedition.Note: You may wish to share the foregoing article via Facebook, Twitter or Linked-In.

      "Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara on Sunday said the indemnity provision of the bill proposing to fast track the procurement of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines is meant only to free vaccine manufacturers from any liability should their products cause side effects.\n",
      "Sen. Sonny Angara (Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Angara stressed that the inclusion of such provision is not in anticipation that Filipinos will develop such side effects.The indemnification fund will just be a guaranteethat the government would be ready to shoulder the responsibility in case of any possible untoward event that would happen in administering the vaccine. “The indemnification is just something the manufacturers want to secure to make sure that if someone gets sick because of the vaccine, it would be the government that purchased the vaccine that would accept responsibility,” Angara said in an interview over Radio DZBB.Angara pointed out that since vaccine development usually takes up to Phase 4 clinical trials, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have already given emergency use authority for some vaccines even without completing all phases.\n",
      "“This indemnity is what the manufacturers were asking from us, because they know that these vaccines were manufactured in a rush and the government is asking it because we are in an emergency situation, we are under a pandemic,” he pointed out.\n",
      "Angara, chairman of the Senate finance committee and sponsor of Senate Bill No. 2057, said this does not mean Filipinos will definitely develop serious side effects when they take the vaccines.\n",
      "“This was only asked by some manufacturers that sell the vaccines especially those that are under the COVAX facility,” he said.The measure primarily seeks to expedite the procurement of the COVID-19 vaccines by empowering local government units (LGUs) to make advance payments to purchase the vaccines. The same bill also seeks to establish a P500-million national indemnity fund to compensate inoculated persons who would experience serious side effects or, possibly, death.

      "(Photo by SEBASTIEN BOZON / AFP)\n",
      "Roque made the statement when he made a guest appearance on the country’s longest-running noontime show “Eat Bulaga!” Saturday, Feb. 20, and played in the “Bawal Judgmental” segment.\n",
      "Before Roque started testing his intuition, comedian and program host Vic Sotto asked Roque about the recent developments in the government’s vaccine procurement efforts.“‘Wag po kayong mag-alala, meron lang konting hitches, pero paparating na rin po ang bakuna para tayo ay magbalik-buhay (Do not worry, there are just a few hitches but the vaccine are arriving soon so we can go back to our normal lives),” Roque said.\n",
      "“Pangako po ‘yan (That’s a promise),” he added.\n",
      "Roque explained that the delivery of the vaccines was delayed because pharmaceutical firms like Pfizer and AstraZeneca required an indemnification agreement. He said the vaccine manufacturers were wary because of the Dengvaxia controversy where drug manufacturer Sanofi was dragged into a legal mess over the reported deaths linked to the dengue vaccine.\n",
      "“Gusto nila ngayon eh magkaroon ng assurance na hindi mangyari yung nangyari sa Dengvaxia na dinemanda yung gumawa ng bakunang yun (They wanted an assurance that there will not be a repeat of the Dengvaxia mess),” he said.The Palace official likewise assured the public that they will not be given life-threatening vaccine shots.\n",
      "“Hindi naman po ‘yan ibibigay sa kanila nang hindi dumaan sa masusing pagsusuri at mga eksperto po ang nagsabi na ligtas at epektibo ‘yan (The vaccines will not be given to them without the shots undergoing scrutiny and experts have said that the vaccines are safe and effective),” Roque said.\n",
      "“So pagdating po ng bakuna, pila-pila na tayo sa bakuna dahil ‘yan talaga ang magiging solusyon dito sa ating pandemyang COVID-19 (So once the vaccine arrives, let’s all line up to get vaccinated because this is really the solution to the COVID-19 pandemic),” he added.On Feb. 18, President Duterte certified as urgent the bills seeking to establish an indemnity fund for those getting the COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "According to Roque, the government will set aside P500 million for the vaccine recipients who may show adverse side effects after getting the shot.\n",
      "Talks about the indemnification agreement surfaced after Pfizer and AstraZeneca, two pharmaceuticals that received an EUA from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), required such an agreement before the vaccine doses could be delivered.\n",
      "On Feb. 17, Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said that the national government has finally submitted the required indemnification agreement to the two vaccine manufacturers. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“The vaccines are safe. Please, for yourself, your family, your community, this country, take the vaccine when it’s your turn and it’s available. That’s how we beat this pandemic,” he said against a backdrop of Pfizer’s gleaming manufacturing equipment at the Michigan facility.Biden said companies making the vaccines are “fastidious” and “it takes more time to do the check for safety than it does to make the vaccine. That’s how fastidious they are.”\n",
      "“If there’s one message to cut through to everyone in the country, it’s this: Vaccines are safe,” he added.\n",
      "Biden said the program to deliver the vaccines into people’s arms is as complicated as the already intense challenges of manufacturing in huge quantities at speed.\n",
      "“There has never, ever, ever been a logistical challenge as consequential as what we’re trying to do, but we’re getting it done,” he said.\n",
      "According to Biden, his goal of administering a million shots a day for a total of 100 million in the first 100 days of his presidency is on track to be easily surpassed, with a current average of 1.7 million vaccines a day.\n",
      "With the death toll set soon to pass 500,000 in the United States, Biden said he did not want to give firm predictions of when the crisis will be curbed.\n",

      "The Presidential Security Group (PSG) personnel who were inoculated with an unregistered coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine last year haven’t experienced any adverse effect and are now considered “safe” from the dreaded disease, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) bared Friday, February 19.\n",
      "Major Gen. Edgard Arevalo, AFP spokesperson, said they haven’t recorded any adverse effect so far among the PSG personnel who volunteered to be administered with the vaccine, which did not have the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval.“We are pleased that the PSG personnel who have volunteered to be vaccinated in the pursuit of their mission to protect the President did not only perform a selfless act, they were also safe as an aftermath of the inoculation,” he said in a statement.Arevalo gave the update nearly two months after it was revealed that some members of the military were already inoculated with an unregistered vaccine, even as the FDA had yet to approve the use of any brand at the time.Although Duterte initially said in a Cabinet meeying that “many Filipinos” had already been vaccinated, it was AFP Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, who was then the Commanding General of the Philippine Army, who made the specific revelation about the inoculation of several military personnel.\n",
      "The AFP investigated the incident and found out that members of the PSG, particularly the close-in security detail of Duterte, were the ones given the first vaccine shots.The issue placed the AFP in a bad light as the national government was criticized for supposedly prioritizing the uniformed personnel over medical frontliners in its vaccination plan.\n",
      "The FDA and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) also called for an investigation to determine how the vaccines, which it described as smuggled, managed to enter the country.\n",
      "Arevalo said the AFP is also waiting for the arrival of the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines in the country, which may happen later this month.\n",
      "He said that this time, the AFP has no canvass yet of military personnel who are willing to get vaccinated.“As professional soldiers, we toe the line of the AFP leadership of being inoculated with what are BFAD-approved [Bureau of Food and Drugs] vaccines to be able to better perform our mandate,” Arevalo said.\n",
      "“But we are mindful to give priority to the medical/health frontliners among us,” he said, noting that about 25 percent of the 180,000-strong AFP are consisted of medical frontliners. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "DILG Undersecretary and spokesperson Jonathan Malaya maintained Friday, Feb. 19, the need to counter vaccine hesitancy among some sectors of the public even if the demand for the COVID-19 dose has steadily increased.\n",
      "DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya, (PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Despite the rise in COVID-19 trust rate, Malaya said there is still a lot of disinformation and fake news being circulated by anti-vaxxers and by the misinformed as this will be “countered head-on by the information drive.’’He noted that the DILG is working closely with the Department of Health (DOH) and Philippine Information Agency (PIA) in mobilizing all LGUs and all DILG attached agencies especially the uniformed personnel from the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) to inform as many Filipinos about the benefits and risks of vaccines, including the processes involved to deliver these vaccines to them.\n",
      "“We are mobilizing all our DILG field officers down to the municipal level and all our chiefs of police, jail wardens, and fire marshals so that they become vaccination champions. Through a series of webinars and dialogues with health experts, we will equip them in their new role as vaccination champions in their respective communities,” Malaya said.\n",

      "“Based on the latest data from OCTA, vaccine hesitancy is at 23 perccent-40 percent depending on the location and circumstances. The good news is that after our town hall meetings, demand increases up to 99 percent so an information drive is instrumental to increase vaccination uptake,” he added.\n",
      "“We urge all LGUs to hold barangay assemblies, town hall meetings and make full use of social media to promote vaccination,” said Malaya.Under DILG Memorandum Circular 2021-019 signed by DILG officer-in-charge Bernardo Florece, all LGUs are directed to lead in local demand generation to improve vaccine confidence in their respective communities.\n",

      "This, as Galvez said that the separate deal the government has with the Covax facility–led by the World Health Organization (WHO)–for the delivery of the American-made Pfizer-BioNTech and British, Swedish-made AstraZeneca vaccines is still being negotiated.\n",
      "“We are trying our best, maybe one of these days we might go to India where more or less two to three billion doses will be produced by the Serum Institute of India. It is where we bought a big bulk of Novavax vaccines,” Galvez said during a visit of the Coordinated Operations to Defeat Epidemic (CODE) Team in the municipality of Pateros.The country was assured of at least 30 million doses of Novavax vaccines, to be delivered possibly in July 2021, by the Serum Institute of India.\n",
      "Meanwhile, NTF officials and Philippine Ambassador to United States Jose Manuel Romualdez met with Covax and Gavi executives on Friday to talk about the status of their deals after the government signed indemnification agreements to ensure the delivery of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines within the first and second quarter of 2021 — possibly the latest of which is late February.\n",
      "The indemnification agreements will ensure that the manufacturers will be free from “unnecesary” litigation should adverse effects are observed from patients inoculated with the vaccines, Galvez explained.\n",
      "Galvez did not divulge other details of the meeting but he said Gavi executives from New York assured them that the Philippines is “almost on top of the priorities” of the Covax facility.“Our negotiation with the Covax facility is still ongoing. We are hopeful that the Covax will fulfill their commitment to bring us their 44 million doses in the first and second quarter [of 2021],” he said.\n",
      "The indemnification requirement is supposedly one of the reasons why the slated delivery of 117,000 doses of Pfizer jabs to the country by mid-February was delayed.\n",
      "Galvez said the Dengvaxia dengue vaccine mess in 2017 played a big part why manufacturers are more careful now in entering deals with countries with no indemnification law, such as the Philippines.While the government has already signed the indemnification requirements of Covax, Galvez said separate agreements will have to be made with the Pfizer-BioNTEch and AstraZeneca since they also have separate bilateral deals with them for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",

      "He also said that this has a direct impact, especially to cities which had earlier signed the multilateral agreement with the Department of Health (DoH), National Task Force Against COVID-19, and AstraZeneca. “But this will, more importantly, benefit all LGUs similarly situated,” he added.\n",
      "Leonardia said the city government is preparing the advance payment of 20 percent, as per contract, of the total cost of 650,000 doses of vaccines it will procure from AstraZeneca.“We make sure the city will settle the payment before the deadline to ensure that we get the delivery of the vaccines starting the third quarter of this year,” the Bacolod mayor added.

      "SenatorsChristopher Lawrence “Bong” Go and Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara are convinced that the bill proposing to relax rules on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines will hurdle Senate approval with ease.\n",
      "(Photo by John Cairns / University of Oxford / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Aside from Go and Angara among the principal-authors, 15 more senators have co-authored Senate Bill (SB) 2057 or the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Bill.\n",
      "Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health,has co-sponsored SB 2057 designed to hasten the procurement of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines.The measure allows local government units (LGUs) to procure vaccines and make advance payments, and to include an indemnification fund requested by vaccine manufacturers to cover the possible expenses and claims arising from adverse effects of the vaccines.\n",
      "AccordingAngara, the principal sponsor of the measure to hasten the process of procurement and administration of the COVID-19 vaccines, the measure gives authority to the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 to “undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport, and distribution.”\n",
      "If required by the supplier, manufacturer, distributor, contractor or consultant, the bill also allows LGUs procuring their own vaccines to pay in advance not more than 50 percent of the contract price.The said measure was also co-authored by Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph G. Recto, Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri, and Senators Imee R. Marcos, Grace Poe, Pia S. Cayetano, Ramon ‘’Bong’’ Revilla Jr., Francis Tolentino, Sherwin Gatchalian, Nancy Binay, Cynthia A. Villar, Risa Hontiveros, Francis Pangilinan, Emmanuel ‘’Manny’’ Pacquiao, Joel Villanueva and Richard J. Gordon.“In the spirit of bayanihan, some LGUs have entered into tripartite agreements with the national government and vaccine manufacturers and have allotted funds to help ensure the immediate and efficient roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccination program. Malaking tulong po ito. Sa kabila nito, marami pa tayong mga oportunidad upang magtulungan (This is a big help. Aside from this, there are more opportunities for us to work together), ”Go said.SB 2057 also proposes the creation of a COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund. It will be administered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and will be sourced from the 2021 national budget’s Contingent Fund.\n",
      "“The Vaccine Indemnification Fund is intended to be earmarked exclusively to compensate and indemnify identified vaccine recipients who sustain injury in connection with the use of the vaccines and where the adverse effects may be attributed to the vaccination,” Go explained.He added that, according to vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., all vaccine manufacturers require indemnity and liability frameworks, which include setting up an indemnification fund backed by legislation to safeguard them from possible liabilities.\n",
      "Go also emphasized and commended the inclusion of a provision in the Committee Report that would waive the requirement of Phase 4 trials for COVID-19 medication and vaccine stipulated in the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law to expedite the procurement of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "“The provision under Bayanihan 2 is due to expire next month which is why this provision is needed to cover the ongoing procurement of vaccines,” Go explained.\n",
      "The Health Technology Assessment Council will now have the authority to make recommendations to the DOH and the PhilHealth on COVID-19 vaccines based on preliminary data from Phase 3 clinical trials and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations.\n",
      "“I just want to underscore that to ensure safety, there must be an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration,” Go suggested. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Amid persistent reports that fake vaccines for Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) are being sold and and are being administered in some parts of the country, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) ordered the Philippine National Police (PNP) on Thursday, Feb 18, to exercise extra vigilance to arrest groups selling or administering fake doses for the virus.\n",
      "(Pexels)\n",
      "The order came after Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto posted on Twitter a picture of supposedly fake Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines and warned the public not to purchase them. There were also reports that fake COVID-19 vaccines are being circulated in the market as the demand for vaccination increases.\n",
      "DILG officer-in-charge (OIC) Bernardo C. Florece, Jr. pointed out that errant groups have taken advantage of the pandemic and are now engaged in transactions involving fake COVID-19 vaccines.“I am directing the PNP to arrest these criminals and ensure that these bogus vaccines are taken off the market,” Florece said.\n",
      "He insisted the PNP must work double time in “making certain that no bogus coronavirus vaccines are sold to unsuspecting people.’’ Florece noted that all possible areas such as air and sea ports where illegal supplies of fake coronavirus vaccines may enter the country must be properly and strictly monitored by the PNP Aviation Security Group and Maritime Group, among others.

      "(Photo by Andrej ISAKOVIC / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Senator Nancy Binay said she is disappointed that at this point the only thing that is certain is that the Philippines still has to wait for vaccines supplies to arrive in its ports, despite the series of dry runs the government task force for COVID-19 has already done.\n",
      "“Parang at this point, ang sigurado lang ay hindi sigurado kung kelan dadating yung bakuna (at this point, it seems what is certain is that it is uncertain when the vaccines will arrive),” Binay said in an interview over ANC’s Headstart.On the other hand, she said, Congress has been doing its best to respond to the request of the government’s task force in order to expedite the roll out of the vaccination program.\n",
      "“I think we’ve proven within ourselves na kapag may hiniling ang (that whenever there is a request from the) executive department, we deliver.\n",
      "“You can see that when we passed Bayanihan 1 and 2, yung FIST—anything that would help us recover from this pandemic. Mabilis pa kami sa alas-singko na magta-trabaho (we go to work immediately),” she said of the two COVID-related laws and the Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer Act which provides insulation against shocks to the Philippine banking sector.\n",
      "Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, during the Senate’s session on Wednesday, also expressed fears, pointed out many are still baffled by the country’s current situation as countries like Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar have already started rolling out COVID-19 jabs.“Bakit tayo hanggang ngayon, wala pa rin? (Why is it that until now we still have nothing?)” Drilon pointed out.\n",
      "“Each day we fail to start the vaccination raises the risk of further spread of the virus and makes our economic recovery longer,” he lamented.\n",
      "Drilon noted the government has not signed any supply agreement for COVID-19 vaccines. This, he said, would pose as a great risk apart from Filipinos’ lack of confidence in the vaccines themselves.\n",
      " Sen. Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara on Wednesday said supply agreements for the Philippines’ procurement of COVID-19 vaccines may be signed by the end of February.\n",
      "Angara made the remark when he defended Senate Bill No. 2057 that seeks to expedite the purchase and administration of the vaccines and establishing a P500-million indemnification fund.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. had earlier said the government is still finalizing the supply agreement with manufacturers Sinovac, Novavax and Moderna. Galvez has been prodding Congress to pass an indemnification law, which he said is required by the COVAX facility.

      "MODERNA\n",
      "Another mRNA vaccine, with a 94.1-percent efficacy rate, has been approved for use in the EU, North America, Britain, and several other nations, including Israel and Singapore.\n",
      "ASTRAZENECA/OXFORDThis viral vector vaccine is authorised for use in the EU, Britain and other countries such as India.\n",
      "It was shown to be 60 percent effective in trials, but a relative lack of safety and efficacy data among older participants has led several countries to recommend against administering the vaccine to those over 65.\n",
      "SPUTNIK VRussia’s vaccine works in a similar way to the AstraZeneca/Oxford jab, but has a 91.6-percent efficacy according to trial results.\n",
      "More than a dozen nations have authorised its use, including Belarus, Armenia, Iran, Algeria, Argentina, South Korea and Venezuela.\n",
      "Its makers have begun the process of asking for approval from the European Medicines Agency. Hungary is the sole EU member state that has started administering doses.\n",
      "SINOPHARM\n",
      "Two vaccines developed in China use the traditional technique of injecting the deactivated virus in order to trigger an immune response.As well as the United Arab Emirates, Hungary, Cambodia, Peru and Zimbabwe have all started administering the vaccine, which its makers say is 79 percent effective.\n",
      "SINOVAC\n",
      "The other Chinese-developed vaccine uses a similar technique and is authorised for use in China, Chile, Brazil and Turkey.\n",
      "Others such as Ukraine and Uruguay have pre-ordered doses.Its makers say it is 50 percent effective against COVID-19 (and 80 percent effective against severe illness), but trial results have not yet been made public.\n",
      "JOHNSON & JOHNSON\n",
      "The US pharma giant has asked for emergency use authorisation for its single-shot vaccine in the US and EU.\n",

      "Foreign ministers met virtually for a first-ever UN Security Council session on vaccinations called by current chair Britain, which said the world had a “moral duty” to act together against the pandemic that has killed more than 2.4 million people.\n",
      "Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced alarm that just 10 nations have administered 75 percent of doses so far — and 130 countries have had none at all.“The world urgently needs a global vaccination plan to bring together all those with the required power, scientific expertise and production and financial capacities,” Guterres said.\n",
      "He said the Group of 20 major economies was in the best position to set up a task force on financing and implementation of global vaccinations and offered full support of the United Nations.\n",
      "“If the virus is allowed to spread like wildfire in the Global South, it will mutate again and again. New variants could become more transmissible, more deadly and, potentially, threaten the effectiveness of current vaccines and diagnostics,” Guterres said.\n",

      "Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard denounced the “injustice” of what he called a “deepening gap” as wealthy countries “monopolize the vaccines.”\n",
      "There is already a plan to help developing nations — Covax is an initiative funded by donors and governments that aims to procure two billion vaccine doses in 2021 with options for a further billion.Covax will soon be able to start delivery of vaccines after the World Health Organization approved the shot developed by AstraZeneca, on which the initiative is almost entirely reliant in its first wave.\n",
      "But aid groups say that many people still risk being left out due to a shortfall in Covax funding to arrange the administration and delicate transportation of vaccines as well as conflicts that make inoculation efforts impossible.\n",
      "Britain, one of the largest contributors to Covax with a commitment of £548 million ($760 million), reiterated a UN call for temporary ceasefires to allow vaccinations, estimating that more than 160 million people were at risk in conflict zones.\n",
      "“We have a moral duty to act, and a strategic necessity to come together to defeat this virus,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.\n",
      "In his first Security Council appearance, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed that President Joe Biden’s administration would take a leadership role after reversing Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the World Health Organization.Blinken said the United States would pay up its more than $200 million in obligations to the UN body by the end of the month and make a “significant” contribution to Covax.\n",
      "“The United States will work as a partner to address global challenges,” Blinken said.\n",
      "– Pressure on China –\n",
      "But Blinken vowed to press for improvements in the WHO, which Trump, under fire for his own handling of the pandemic, accused of being beholden to China and not stopping the deadly virus.\n",
      "“All countries must make available all data from the earliest days of any outbreak,” Blinken said, in a veiled renewal of US criticism that China has not cooperated with a WHO probe into how the virus first emerged in 2019 in Wuhan.\n",

      "As for the private sector, the senator was informed the private firms have perfected contracts and already made 50-percent down payment for six million doses of the vaccine.\n",
      "Galvez, however, pointed out that the procurements of the LGUs and the private sector were done through tripartite agreements involving the national government.“So ang private sector may perfected contract, may downpayment; ang local government may perfected contract pero wala pang downpayment. Ang national government walang perfected contract, walang downpayment (So the private sector already has a perfected contract and downpayment; while local governments have perfected contracts but no downpayment. But the national government has no perfected contract or downpayments yet)?” Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said.“Tama po, ang pinakasigurista po ‘yong national government ho (Yes, the national government was the most perfectionist of them all),” Angara confirmed.\n",
      "Galvez earlier blamed the delay in the delivery of the Pfizer vaccines to the country on the lack of an indemnification law that would ensure compensation in case of adverse reactions to their products.\n",
      "He said the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility, from the which the Pfizer vaccines will be acquired, requires governments to have an indemnity mechanism.But Recto observed that an indemnification law may “not be necessary” since LGUs and private firms managed to perfect contracts and make down payments prior the passage of such law.\n",
      "“I’m just trying to wonder why we have not been able to sign any contract, the national government?…And I don’t see anything here in this bill that would hasten the procurement by the national government,” he said.\n",

      "Together with the University of the Philippines – College of Public Health, the knowledge-exchange clinic pools technical resources between the UK and the Philippines to share learning on safely delivering the vaccine.\n",

And the UK, through the British Embassy in Manila, remains committed to supporting Filipinos access to vaccines, developed under transparent mechanisms and delivered safely and effectively,” Pruce said during the inaugural session on February 10, 2021.The UK Prosperity Fund-backed series will convene technical, scientific, and policy experts from the UK Vaccine Task Force, the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies, Health Education England and the National Health Service in sessions covering the following: deployment and procurement strategies; community-based vaccine delivery and administration; and tackling vaccine hesitancy.Earlier, the British government has allocated £548m to the United Nations-led COVAX Advance Market Commitment, which is aiming to distribute 1 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year.Early this month, the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) designated the Philippines as among the first countries that could receive an indicative distribution of up to 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines; mostly of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed in the United Kingdom through the COVAX Global Vaccines Facility. It is expected that the vaccine will start being available for delivery from the first quarter of 2021.National Task Force (NTF) chief Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., thanked the British government for its support in helping the vaccination of about 9 million Filipinos in the first half of 2021League of Cities Vaccine Procurement Committee Chair and Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas encouraged local governments to participate in the learning exchange webinars which he said will be of great help for local governments to inform strategies in administering vaccines through local health systems.

      "While people are waiting for the arrival of the vaccines against COVID-19, many stories about the vaccine – from the experiences of those who have already been given the second jab, to questions on who can be given the vaccines are crowding digital media.The Philippine Society of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (PSAAI) on Feb. 11 conducted a virtual forum titled “Allergies and COVID–19 Vaccines: A Heart to Heart Talk” to clarify the issues that are related to allergies.\n",
      "Themain speakers were PSAAI President Dr. Rommel Crisenio M. Lobo and Dr. Maria Carmen D. Ang, a PSAAI member.\n",
      "In the forum, Dr. Ang assured the public that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh the potential risks of adverse reactions. “Based on current data, the benefits of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risk of an allergic reaction,” she said.Here are some of the issues related to allergies which were discussed by PSAAI doctors during the webinar:\n",
      "Reactogenic reaction and allergic reaction\n",
      "According to Dr. Ang, reactions to COVID-19 vaccine may occur, but not all reactions are allergic.\n",
      "“Majority of the reactions are reactogenic. This means that since the vaccines stimulate the immune system, they may cause side effects. Reactogenic reactions are not the same as allergic reactions,” she said during the media forum.\n",
      "(Daniel Schludi / UNSPLASH / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The official statement of PSAAI posted on their website explained: “A reactogenic reaction is an inflammatory, response that occurs after vaccination.”\n",
      "In the forum , Dr. Ang said: “Examples of reactogenic reactions include pain and swelling in the injection site that occurs within the first three days. It can be systemic like headache, muscle pain, fever and chills, vomiting, tiredness, and body aches.”Dr. Ang said that those reactions are usually gone within one to three days and can be managed withparacetamol, pain relievers, hydration, or cold compress.\n",
      "Anaphylaxis\n",
      "On the other hand, “allergy is an exaggerated immune response to a usually harmless substance,” said Dr. Ang. Anaphylaxis is a type of severe allergic reaction.\n",
      "The PSAAI statement in its website explained: “Anaphylaxis, which is a severe type I reaction, is rare with an estimated incidence of 11.1 per 1million doses of mRN COVID-19 vaccines. The incidence of anaphylaxis to other covid-19 vaccines is currently unknown.”\n",
      "(Photo by Dogukan Keskinkilic / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "In the forum, Dr. Ang explained: “Patients who develop anaphylaxis can have two or more organs involved and these may result in developing symptoms such as rashes or hives, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, vomiting, swelling of the face, low blood pressure, fast heart beat.” Anaphylaxis usually happens within the first 15 to 30 minutes after injection.\n",
      "However, Ang said that “severe allergic reactions are rare.” She said that “mild allergic reactions are managed with antihistamines. Anaphylaxis is rare and (this is) managed with epinephrine.”\n",
      "Dr. Ang and Dr. Lobo said that they have not heard of deaths due to anaphylaxis that can be linked to COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "People with allergies\n",
      "Ang said that people with allergy to food, inhalant allergens, among others, can take the COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "“Patients with allergy to food such as egg; allergy to inhalant allergens (such as) dust mites, pollens, pets; to insects; those with eczema, those patients with controlled asthma whether they are inhalers or not; those patients with allergic rhinitis whether they are on nasal sprays or not; patients with history of urticaria; patients who have history of rashes to oral medications can receive the vaccine,” she said.\n",
      "Allergic reaction to other vaccines\n",
      "Meanwhile, patients who had “an immediate allergic reaction to other vaccines other than the COVID-19 vaccines and other injectable medications, need further evaluation by an allergist/ immunologist if they can receive the COVID-19 vaccine or not,” said Ang.This file photo taken on January 08, 2021 shows empty bottles of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine at the Emile Muller hospital in Mulhouse, eastern France.\n",
      "(Photo by SEBASTIEN BOZON / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“If they are cleared for vaccination, they should be observed for at least 30 minutes,” she said.Who should not receive the second dose of COVID-19 vaccines?\n",
      "The patients who had mild or severe allergic reactions to the first dose are advised not receive the second dose, said Dr. Ang.\n",
      "“Patients with immediate allergic reaction whether mild to severe, such as anaphylaxis, after the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine should not receive the second dose,” said Ang.\n",

      "“Those patients with a history of allergic reactions to any component of the COVID-19 vaccine, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate should not receive the vaccine as well. These patients should be referred to an allergist or immunologist for further evaluation,” she added.\n",
      "Those who experienced reactogenic reactions\n",
      "PSAAI President Dr. Rommel Lobo said that those who experience reactogenic reactions (injection site pain, among others) should take the second dose of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Vaccination sites ready for patients with allergic reactions\n",
      "The PSAAI said that healthcare workers who will be manning the vaccination sites are trained to manage allergic reactions. Vaccine recipients will be first screened by the health workers before the vaccine will be injected to them.\n",
      "“Yes, they are trained in recognizing and giving the first intervention which is your epinephrine. Firstly, you will not be vaccinated right away. In the vaccination site, the doctors and nurses there have a checklist to screen vaccinee if they are fit to be vaccinated,” said Dr. Lobo.\n",
      "“Epinephrine will be made available in the vaccination centers.Patients who undergo vaccination will be observed for 30 minutes. If during the 30 minutes, the doctor there would say that the patient is having anaphylaxis, then epinephrine will be injected and the patient will be brought to the nearest (hospital) ER (emergency room),” said Dr. Maria Carmela Kasala, a member of PSAAI.\n",

      "” We scheduled it first hour this afternoon, matatapos po namin ito, mamayang hapon (we can finish it this afternoon). We commit that,” the Senate official said on the government’s daily Laging Handa public briefing, February 17.Should President Duterte certify the measure as urgent, as Cabinet members had appealed, Zubiri said the Senate could pass the bill on final reading immediately.\n",

      "The bill also provides a P500-million indemnity fund in case of death or severe adverse effects following the immunization. The appropriation, sourced from the contingent fund under the 2021 General Appropriations Act, would be administered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.\n",
      "The bill also seeks to grant public officers, employees, contractors or volunteers immunity from liability over claims related to the administration of the vaccines.

      "In a virtual press briefing, Dizon said the national government and local government units have trained enough vaccinators and are ready to vaccinate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos in 2021.\n",

      "“The composition of such vaccines are not tested and even worst (sic) fake vaccines may not be effective thus further exposing users to the dangers of COVID-19,” it added.The BOC gave the warning even as the Philippines is expected to receive it supply of the sought-after vaccines from abroad anytime this month, if not this week.\n",
      "“Early in the year, the Bureau released its initial advisory as the result of an article published by the International Police (INTERPOL).

      "The Senate Committee on Finance has endorsed for plenary approval the measure seeking to expedite the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines in the country.\n",
      "Sen. Sonny Angara (Henzberg Austria / Senate PRIB)\n",
      "Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, chair of the Senate finance panel, said approval of Senate Bill No. 2057 or the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 is necessary to help the country realize its goal to be COVID-free this year, 2021.\n",
      "“We, as a people, have lost so much because of the pandemic—in terms of jobs, opportunities and human life. However, we believe that with this measure, we have not lost out on the belief that there will in fact be an end to this ordeal,” Angara said in his sponsorship speech.The bill, a consolidation of other COVID-19 related bills filed by senators, primarily aims to expedite procurement of the vaccines by authorizing the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport and distribution.\n",
      "The measure also allows local government units (LGUs), namely provinces, cities and municipalities to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services but only in cooperation with the DOH and the NTF.\n",
      "The bill also allows LGUs to make advance payments for the purchase of the vaccines and supplies but only for up to 50 percent of their target population. It also mandates LGUs to give due priority to frontline health workers, senior citizens, and indigent persons as recipients of the vaccines.\n",
      "Under the bill, LGUs will also be allowed to use whatever resources they have to purchase vaccines and supplies, on top of the P82.5-billion that has been appropriated in 2021 for the government’s national immunization program against COVID-19.The bill also allows private entities to purchase vaccines subject to similar restrictions and conditions set for LGUs. It also exempts COVID-19 vaccines and supplies from customs duties, value added tax (VAT), excise tax, donor’s tax and other fees and charges levied on the purchased vaccines.\n",
      "The measure also establishes a COVID-19 National Indemnification Fund—as proposed by the Department of Finance—in order to compensate any inoculated person that would subsequently suffer serious adverse side effects or SAEs after being vaccinated.\n",
      "The bill also seeks a Vaccination Passport Program, in compliance with data privacy laws. These passports will contain only relevant information such as basic personal information, manufacturer of the vaccine used, date of inoculation, etc.The measure, Angara said, also authorizes the Health Technology Assessment Council or HTAC to make recommendations to the DOH and PhilHealth about COVID-19 vaccines based on preliminary Phase 3 clinical trials, but only if the relevant vaccine manufacturer has been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n",
      "“Through the aforementioned steps, we hope to break down some regulatory barriers, free up some resources, and empower as many government instrumentalities as we can towards the fast procurement and expeditious roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccinations,” Angara stressed.

      "This, as the Administrative Support for COVID-19 Task Force (ASCOTF) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) has stepped up its information drive to convince all its personnel to avail of the government’s vaccination against the coronavirus infection.\n",
      "Lt. Gen. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, Deputy Chief for Administration and concurrent PNP-ASCOTF commander, said the aggressive information drive is being done through an application exclusive for all the PNP personnel.Through PNP CODA (COVID-19 Data), Eleazar said videos and fact sheets from the Department of Health and other scientists about the benefits of vaccination are regularly posted to educate both the uniformed and civilian personnel on how the vaccine works and its benefits amid the continuous threat of infection from the deadly virus.\n",
      "“Some of our personnel are really hesitant to avail of the COVID-19 vaccine and we attribute it to the deluge of information that they would read or see especially in the social media. But as our health experts always say, vaccination far outweighs the potential risks and claims of danger,” said Eleazar.\n",
      "“So what we do now is to persuade them or convince them to be vaccinated. But we would like to clarify that we are not forcing them, we are just trying to explain everything to them,” he added.\n",
      "Last week, the PNP Health Service initiated a survey among PNP personnel to identify who among them want to be vaccinated. Policemen, especially those assigned in the COVID-19 response frontlines and those whose assignments are related to contain the pandemic, are in the government’s priority list.Based on the initial result, almost half of the policemen surveyed did not want to be vaccinated.\n",
      "While the respondents were only asked if they want to be vaccinated, Eleazar said those who said no gave an explanation as to why they are refusing the free COVID-19 vaccination offer of the government.\n",
      "He said most of the respondents who said no stated that they want to have more information about the vaccination while some responded that they need more time to decide.“That is their honest to goodness perception about the vaccines. And that also serves as the basis of our intervention. So our Health Service came up with DOH vaccination videos for the appreciation of our personnel,” said Eleazar.\n",
      "As a result of the information drive, Eleazar said that thousands of policemen changed their mind and signified interest in being vaccinated.\n",
      "“From 49 percent when we first conducted the survey, the percentage of those who do not want to be vaccinated is now only at 37 percent. Based on our data, this translates to a change of mind of more than 26,000 of our personnel,” he said.\n",
      "Eleazar said they expect more policemen to avail of the COVID-19 vaccines as the PNP has expanded the information dissemination on the vaccination using other platforms such as direct talks with PNP personnel. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "There is nothing to worry about the country’s coronavirus vaccine supply even though the government has yet to sign a supply agreement with the manufacturers, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said Monday.\n",
      "Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles\n",
      "(PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "According to Nograles, the government has secured a reserve supply of COVID-19 vaccines under the term sheets initially forged with various drug manufacturers. The supply agreement, he added, may be finalized once the local drug regulators give the green light for the emergency use of the vaccines.\n",
      "“What we signed is term sheets and that term sheet, according to (vaccine czar) Secretary (Carlito) Galvez, is already a commitment kumbaga so it is not something to worry about because the term sheet already commits the number of doses na magkakaroon tayo dito sa Pilipinas (that we will have in the Philippines),” Nogralse said over CNN Philippines Monday, Feb. 15.“It’s like already reserved to the Philippines based on those term sheets and then the supply agreement will come forthwith,” said Nograles, co-chair of the government’s policy-making task force in battling the pandemic.\n",
      "Nograles said certain conditions must be met before any coronavirus vaccine is used in the country. The vaccines must pass the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for safety and efficacy.\n",
      "“I think presumably the supply agreement will come after all of these, like the FDA approval natin. The EUA or emergency use authorization would be issued by the FDA so there are certain conditions that have to be met,” he said.\n",
      "“Although nagkaroon ng term sheet with different vaccine brands, not all the vaccine brands already have an EUA,” he added.So far, two vaccine brands, namely those developed by US-based Pfizer and British drugmaker AstraZeneca, have gained emergency use approval from the FDA in the country.\n",
      "Nograles said the emergency approval of the Sinovac vaccines is expected to be issued soon. Other vaccine makers like Gamaleya Research Institute and Moderna are also expected to submit their application before FDA.\n",
      "“So that’s basically what happens. There’s a term sheet agreement on how many doses you need, ang na-i-order namin (we ordered) and then it passes through conditions like FDA approval ng kanilang EUA and then that’s where the ball gets running in terms of the signing of the supply agreement,” he said.“But as far as supply is concerned, na-reserve na ‘yun for the Philippines (it has been reserved for the Philippines),” he added.\n",
      "Galvez recently told a Senate inquiry that the government has not yet finalized any supply agreement but has secured 108 million doses of vaccines from different manufacturers under initial pacts. Supply deals with Sinovac, Novavax and Moderna are already being finalized.\n",
      "Around 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines, donated by China, are expected to arrive in the country on Feb. 23.\n",
      "The government remained hopeful about the delivery of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca supplies under the World Health Organization-backed COVAX facility this month. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“Maybe the right move is to let the elected public officials and other personalities with huge following be vaccinated (with COVID-19 vaccines) first to gain more approval (for the vaccine),’’ Paclibare said.\n",
      "Densing, for his part, said the national government will base the allocation of the COVID-19 vaccines in priority areas with high infection rates like Metro Manila while taking into consideration if the locality has a cold chain storage facility.\n",
      "Before being vaccinated, Densing explained that the person will be first informed on the brand of the vaccine that will be injected which the concerned party may reject.The said person will then be placed at the tail end of the line if he chooses not to be vaccinated, according to Densing.\n",
      "In the event the preferred vaccine purchased by the LGU arrives, Densing said concerned persons who would refuse the first vaccine may line up for the dose offered by the said locality. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara said donated vaccines and other critical medical supplies needed to contain and mitigate novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) should be exempted from donor’s tax.\n",
      "Sen. Sonny Angara (Alexis Nueva España/Senate PRIB)\n",
      "In filing Senate Bill No. 2046, Angara said donations of these life-saving drugs,medical supplies and equipment needed for its administration, delivery and storage should no longer be taxed, especially since the supply of COVID-19 vaccines are becoming widely available for purchase by the government and the private sector.\n",
      "“The national government, local government units (LGUs) and the private sector are all in the thick of preparations for the arrival of the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccines,” said Angara, who chairs the Senate finance committee.“Many of these vaccines will be made available to the public through the generosity of donors. We want to encourage more of these donations by exempting these from the donor’s tax,” he added.\n",
      "Angara pointed out similar incentives were already granted during the implementation of Bayanihan to Heal as One Act (Bayanihan 1) and Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2) in recognition of the need to increase the supplies of goods needed by the country’s frontliners.\n",
      "“Sa pamamagitan nitong panukalang pag-exempt sa donor’s tax ay masisiguro natin ang walang hadlang na pamamahagi ng mga donasyon ng bakuna at iba pang kagamitan para sa ating gobyerno pati na din sa pribadong sektor, (Through this proposed law exempting these products from donor’s tax, we can make sure there are no hindrances in the distribution of these vaccines and other supplies to our government and likewise, to the private sector),” the senator said.\n",
      "Under the bill, donations of drugs, vaccines and medical supplies specifically prescribed and directly used for the treatment of COVID-19 will be exempted from the donor’s tax.Also exempted from donor’s tax are donations of capital equipment, spare parts and raw materials needed for the production of personal protective equipment components such as coveralls, gowns, surgical masks, goggles and face shields.\n",
      "Donations of drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in clinical trials—including raw materials needed for the production of these drugs—would also be exempted.\n",
      "The measure also exempts donations of equipment for waste management, including waste segregation, storage, collection, sorting, treatment and disposal services. Under the proposed law, the grant of donor’s tax exemptions would be in effect from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023; all of the covered donations must only be for use of government and private entities, not for commercial use and shall only be for free distribution to or use for the containment or mitigation of COVID-19.

      "Withthe increasing demand for reliable information on COVID-19 vaccines, International SOS has created an innovative ‘traffic light’ indicator to help businesses track when, where and how they can roll-out corporate COVID-19 vaccination programs for their employees.\n",
      "As global organizations seek advice on corporate COVID-19 vaccine policies, the indicator brings together International SOS’ COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker tapping technology and containing detailed vaccine information for all countries, with regularly updated country-level distribution and program monitoring. This is complemented with bespoke strategic and industry relevant advice from International SOS’ consulting practices.\n",
      "Dr Mark Parrish, Regional Medical Director at International SOS comments, “COVID-19 vaccination programs are a complex issue, particularly for global organizations. Faced with differing regulations, vaccines and roll-out plans dependent on location, it is vital to have a strategic and agile plan in place. This should be underpinned by up-to- date information, analyzed and implemented in accordance with the needs of the workforce. We want to make it as easy as possible for organizations to be able to protect their people at the earliest and in the most efficient way.”\n",
      "In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) recently issued the National Policy Framework for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment and Immunization, setting in motion the country’s vaccination program. Dr Carrianne Ewe, Medical Director at International SOS Philippines shares, “As we continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and the local authority’s approach on the country vaccination, we are able to assist clients in planning their vaccination strategies and protocols for their employees prior to the availability of the vaccine in the country. Educating your workforce with reliable information on the COVID-19 vaccines, communicating its variants, benefits and establishing facts from myths, is critical when implementing a corporate vaccination program. This provides a level of assurance to the employee that there is an end in sight. This support to our clients prepares their organization once the relevant COVID vaccines become available in the Philippines, ensuring a healthy and productive workforce and a safe return to office.”\n",
      "International SOS is already supporting many of its Fortune Global 500 clients with strategic health advice from its global consulting practice, including its worldwide COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker. The internationally recognized red, amber, green traffic light system, enables clients to quickly recognize where a site or office has the potential to roll out a vaccine program. The information is updated daily.\n",
      "Dr Parrish added “Obviously organizations are keen to ensure that employees are protected from COVID-19 and to uphold their Duty of Care. Our clients want to know where and what vaccines are available to them for their employees, as well as where they may be asked to actively participate in vaccination programs and their responsibility to do this. They are considering overall how it affects operations and what a corporate COVID-19 vaccine policy should contain. Many also want guidance on what they can be doing within the wider society to enhance vaccine update in communities.”\n",

      "US biotech firm Moderna said Friday it was seeking clearance with regulators around the world to put 50 percent more coronavirus vaccine into each of its vials as a way to quickly boost current supply levels.\n",
      "The company issued a statement after The New York Times first reported the US Food and Drug Administration had already cleared it to increase levels by 40 percent.\n",
      "“In order to better maximize resources as well as maximize opportunities to deliver more doses into each market faster, Moderna has proposed filling vials with up to 15 doses of vaccine versus the previous 10 doses,” a spokesperson said in a statement to AFP.The spokesperson added the company was engaging in discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and authorities in other countries, and the increased level of doses wouldn’t require different vials to those currently in use.\n",
      "“Any resulting change would be subject to final approval from the various regulatory authorities. Implementation of any such changes would be expected to be completed in approximately a two- to three-month period,” it said.\n",
      "Citing sources close to the matter, the Times reported that the FDA had agreed to Moderna using 14 doses per vial, compared to the previous 10.\n",
      "This would require retooling of production lines that would take less than ten weeks, or before the end of April, the newspaper said.“It would be a great step forward,” Moncef Slaoui, who was the chief scientific advisor for the federal vaccine development program under former president Donald Trump, told the Times.“I think it will have an impact in the short term.”\n",
      "Some ten percent of Americans have so far received at least one Covid vaccine dose, with Moderna accounting for just under half the number and Pfizer just over half.The Biden administration announced Thursday it had reached a deal with both these companies to supply a total of 600 million doses of their two-shot courses by the end of July, enough to cover 90 percent of the US population.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The country’s electric cooperatives (ECs) are offering their sites for the government-underpinned Covid-19 inoculation program, which targets to attain herd immunity for the Philippine population against the dreaded virus.In a statement to the media, the Philippine Rural Electric Cooperatives Association Inc. (PHILRECA) noted that by utilizing the EC sites, this could help both the national government and the local government units (LGUs) to “ensure proper and orderly rollout of the coronavirus vaccination plans.”Party-list Representative and House Assistant Minority Leader Sergio Dagooc sounded off the rural power utilities’ readiness in aiding the government on its vaccination undertaking, which is expected to pick up speed in the coming months.He recommended the use of the gymnasiums and multi-purpose halls of the 121 electric cooperatives all over the country, with him noting that “this way, more Filipinos, even those living in far-flung and remote communities, will be reached.”Dagooc similarly stated that the ECs “are ready to coordinate with their respective local government units to assist them in their vaccination plans.”In the State-spearheaded vaccination undertaking, it has been noted that one tricky part will be the logistics component – including the identification of vaccination sites as well as the provision of sufficient and reliable electricity, especially for vaccines that require special handling and refrigeration at negative Centigrade-levels.With PHILRECA’s offer, it is deemed that this could redound to “hitting two birds with one stone” in the required Covid-19 vaccination fixes – because they will not just be providing sites, but the electric utilities will also guarantee that the needed power supply will be there.\n",
      "Dagooc cited a well-known fact that “there are communities still far away from hospitals and government centers; and there are also health centers that suffer from space constraints.”He noted these predicaments prompted the ECs “to become part of the solution by offering their compound and facilities for speedy, and vast yet with appropriate social distancing protocols, when the vaccination program is administered.”The Department of Energy (DOE) just recently called on the country’s power companies to lend a helping hand in the country’s inoculation process, because this is the ultimate measure that can finally pull the plug on the spread of the virus.\n",
      "The department’s plea centers on the provision of “triple safeguard” in electricity service that will be so critically needed once the vaccination program starts.With that appeal, the ECs have come forward to offer help to the government given the reach of their service areas – especially in jurisdictions that are outside urban sprawls.

      "Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo on Friday, Feb. 12, expressed hope that the indemnification issues surrounding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines will soon be ironed out to ensure the smooth and timely roll out of the country’s vaccination program.\n",
      "Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric DomingoDomingo, in an online interview, said that in other countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan, there are laws for indemnification or compensation in case of any vaccine injury.\n",
      "“I hope they settle it soon because I think that’s the last remaining point – the indemnification clause of the contract,” Domingo said. If not, he noted that that the timeline of the vaccination program might be affected.Initially, Domingo said that World Heath Organization (WHO) was ready to ship the vaccines on Feb. 15. “We also prepared for it but I guess they will not ship the vaccines to the Philippines until the details of the contract have been settled,” he added.\n",
      "Domingo said that there is no existing indemnification framework in the country. “In other countries, there is a legal framework for indemnification injury but here, we have no laws that will help, assist or compensate vaccine injuries,” he explained.\n",
      "The need for indemnification, Domingo said, has never happened before because all products that the country procured prior the COVID-19 pandemic “are fully registered.”\n",
      "However, Domingo said for the COVID-19 vaccines, these are under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). “We are asking the companies to give it to us even if they are not ready to commercialize it or sell it yet,” he explained. “Since we decided to use them under EUA, what the companies want is the government will be responsible for any injury,” he explained.This is the case for all vaccines under EUA, Domingo said. “Even the COVAX require an indemnification clause in their contract,” he added.\n",
      "Domingo also expressed support to the proposal to set an Indemnification Fund so in case the the government needs it. “This is a common practice in other countries, for example there are adverse effects or death, the government can compensate the vaccine recipient or the family from the indemnification fund,” he added.\n",
      "When he was still in Department of Health (DOH), Domingo said that they have been pushing for indemnification. “We should have something like thatbecause it also helps decrease hesitancy in vaccination,” he ended. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Likewise, FNU also called on the government to take “responsibility” of vaccine regulation, monitor adverse side effects and public support for treatment and hospitalization.“This should be done alongside a strengthened public health care system that has government-funded, strengthened public infection control measures of free mass testing, systematic contact tracing and adequate quarantine services and economic support for the people,” FNU ended.

      "It launched a series of COVID-19 Vaccine Virtual Town Hall Meeting with health professionals from national government agencies.At least 100 participants from homeowners associations and urban poor groups attended the first meeting done in partnership with the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n",
      "In the latest results of the city government’s survey on COVID-19 vaccine, 2,567 out of 4,074 respondents, or 63 percent, said they were willing to be vaccinated while 788, or 19.34 percent, said “no” and719, or 17.65 percent, did not answer and were classified as “unaccounted.”Of those who said “no,” the No. 1 reason was “side effects that may be experienced,” followed by “doubtful with the efficiency rate of the vaccine,” “fee of vaccination” and “conflict with current health conditions.”\n",
      "During the virtual meeting, RITM Infection Prevention and Control Committee Chair Charissa Borja-Tabora emphasized the safety of vaccines, the process of clinical trials, and the role of vaccines in protecting individuals and communities.\n",

      "Muntinlupa has ordered 400,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca to augment the supply that will be given by the national government.For the AstraZeneca vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) said “the recommended dosage is two doses given intramuscularly (0.5ml each) with an interval of 8 to 12 weeks. Longer dose intervals within the 8 to 12 weeks range are associated with greater vaccine efficacy.”\n",

      "President Joe Biden said Thursday the US had signed deals to acquire 200 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses as officials look to immunize the vast majority of the population by July.\n",
      "No lines are seen at the Lincoln Park Covid-19 vaccination site already closed due to a shortage of vaccines in Los Angeles, California on February 11, 2021. – Facing a severe vaccine shortage, Los Angeles moved to temporarily close five major inoculation centers including its giant Dodger Stadium site on February 11, even as California this week topped the nation’s pandemic death toll. (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP)\n",
      "The deals with Pfizer and Moderna, which the administration had announced it was seeking last month, increase the country’s total vaccine supply by fifty percent, to 600 million doses.\n",
      "“Just this afternoon, we signed … final contracts for 100 million more Moderna and 100 million more Pfizer vaccines,” Biden said after touring the National Institutes of Health near Washington.“We’re now on track to have enough supply for 300 million Americans by the end of July,” he added. Both vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the US require two shots.\n",
      "The US immunization campaign got off to a shaky start in December but has since improved: 46.4 million shots have now reached arms, and at least 34.7 million people have received one or more doses, roughly 10 percent of the population.\n",
      "The vaccine drive entered a new phase Thursday as 6,500 pharmacies began scheduling shots, but a wave of optimism brought about by falling cases could soon be tested by dangerous variants.\n",
      "A million doses were being shipped to drugstores and supermarket pharmacies nationwide, with chains announcing they would begin administering the first shots Friday.The pharmacy program will eventually expand to 40,000 outlets, while the federal government has also used emergency legislation to ramp up vaccine production, opened mass vaccine sites in stadiums, and has begun a separate program to reach underserved communities.\n",
      "Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief advisor on the pandemic, told NBC that by April, vaccines would start being available to anyone who wanted them.\n",
      "While the shots are currently only available to adults, officials have voiced hope that ongoing studies would allow them to be approved for children in the coming months.\n",
      "– Cases falling –Since peaking on January 8 following the holiday season, the US outbreak has been in steep decline, with an average of just over 100,000 daily cases — down from more than 300,000.\n",
      "Hospitalizations and fatalities are following suit — but the worst-hit country in the world is still expected to reach the latest grim milestone of half a million deaths this month.\n",
      "And, because of the fragmented nature of the US health system, widespread confusion persists among the public over where and when they can get vaccinated.Stark racial and economic disparities have also emerged. In the capital Washington, vaccines have been disproportionately allocated to residents of the city’s affluent, white neighborhoods where people have been quicker to register by phone or online.– Rebound fears –\n",
      "Between the number of people already vaccinated and the number of people who’ve already been infected, it’s thought that around 40 percent of the population might have some immunity, which is also contributing to the slowdown in new cases.\n",
      "But while the numbers are headed in the right direction, experts warn it’s not time to get complacent.\n",
      "The winter surge was compounded by people gathering over the holidays for Thanksgiving, Christmas and the New Year, and if those patterns were repeated during last Sunday’s Super Bowl, we can expect to see a spike.\n",
      "The highly-transmissible B.1.1.7 variant that was first identified in Britain is also rapidly spreading in the US and is set to become the dominant strain by March, according to multiple studies.\n",
      "This has the potential to reverse current progress, just as it did for example in Ireland, which had gotten its outbreak under control by late 2020, but was hit by a B.1.1.7 driven exponential wave in January and still recovering. A smaller amount of this variant can cause Covid-19, so attention has shifted toward better masking practices.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Wednesday that wearing a cloth mask on top of a medical mask, or knotting and tucking a medical mask to fit more snugly, offers significantly better protection against catching or spreading Covid-19.

      "The Healthcare Professionals’ Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) has opposed a Senate bill that proposes to allow local government units (LGUs) to expeditiously procure vaccines, saying that this measure will have a negative impact on the distribution of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines.“The HPAAC strongly opposes the passage of SB 2042 which expedites the purchase of vaccines against COVID-19 by exempting local government units from procurement laws,” the group said in a statement.The Senate Bill No. 2042, filed by Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri, states that “provinces, cities and municipalities may directly purchase vaccines for the protection against the coronavirus disease.”The proposed measure also allows LGUs to “secure other goods and services necessary for their storage, transport and distribution.”\n",
      "In a statement on Jan. 11, the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF), said thatLGUs cannot procure and roll out COVID-19 vaccines on their own as this “must be coordinated with the national government, through the NTF and the DOH in a tripartite agreement involving local governments and pharmaceutical companies.”\n",
      "The HPAAC warned that the proposed measure would cause “three big problems.”\n",
      "According to HPAAC Convenor Dr. Antonio Dans, the bill “will lead to maldistribution of vaccines based on capacity to pay.”\n",
      "“Nanawagan kami sa ating mga senators, lalo na kay Senator Zubiri, na sana i-reconsider nila ang provisions ng SB 2042, dahil malaki ang magiging impact nito sa tiwala ng mga tao, hindi lang sa effectiveness sa bakuna, dahil ang tiwala ng mga tao nagtitiwala na walang gulangan, walang agawan, patas-patas lang (We call on our senators, especially Senator Zubiri, to reconsider the provisions of SB 2042, because it will have a big impact on the people’s trust, not only on the effectiveness of the vaccine, but also on the people’s trust on the its fair distribution),” said Dans during a virtual briefing on Thursday night, Feb. 11.\n",
      "The group said that the emergency use authorization being issued by the FDA is based on the declaration of a national emergency, noting that the pandemic is “not a local problem.”The group noted that if LGUs will be allowed to procure vaccines on their own, then “priorities will be defined by capacity to pay rather than need for the vaccine. If this were to happen, we would not be able to achieve the twin goals of reduction in mortality and maintenance of healthcare capacity.”\n",
      "It said that prioritization and distribution of vaccines “requires centralized orchestration.”\n",
      "“Paano nila naisip na gumawa ng Senate bill na iyan para sa isang bakuna na naka emergency use authorization pa lamang? Ang procurement ay para lamang sa mga regular na gamot na meron ng Certificate of Product Registration (How come they think of making that Senate bill for a vaccine that has only been given an emergency use authorization? Procurement is only for regular drugs that have a Certificate of Product Registration),” said Dr. Aileen Espina, a member of HPAAC.\n",
      "“Naka EUA po sya. Hindi ba dapat ang national government lang ang bukod tanging magpro-procure? Bakit ganoon? Bakit nila shino-short circuit ang proseso (These vaccines are for EUA. Shouldn’t the national government be the only one to procure? Why so? Why do they have to shortcut the process),” she added.Espina said that the suggested priority groups for the COVID vaccination program is based on “science.”\n",
      "“Bakit ba nagkaroon ng prioritization? Ibinasa kasi ito sa siyensya. May science ang pagprioritize: sino ba ang dapat mauna: based on need at pinakamalaki ang epekto nya in terms of achieving herd immunity earlier. (Why is there a prioritization? It is based on science. There’s science in prioritization: who should come first based on need and this will have a huge impact in terms of achieving herd immunity),” she said.Moreover, Dans said that the Senate bill “will bypass the required recommendation of leading experts in Health Technology Assessment.”\n",
      "“Bypassing recommendations of this council will expose the people to the dangers of inappropriate technology, and may make local policy makers liable for wrong decisions,” he said. \n",
      "Another problem that the HPAAC sees in the proposed bill is that it “could drive increases in vaccine cost,” said Dans. “Tataas ang cost ng bakuna kasi hindi na iisa ang buyer. Meron single buyer advantagekung central government, pwede siyang makipag negotiate ng magandang presyo. Pero kung kanya-kanyang bili, syempre baka tumaas ang presyo (The cost of the vaccine will increase because there will no longer be a single buyer. There is a single buyer advantage if it will be done by thecentral government: it can negotiate a good price. But if we buy individually, of course the price may go up),” said Dans. The HPAAC said that “vaccines are our life vests out of a sinking ship. Let us use them well and distribute fairly and wisely.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Dr. Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, stressed this during a ‘’Bakit Bakuna Roadshow’’ for COVID-19 Vaccine Program for Communities forum at the House of Representatives today.\n",
      "‘’It (vaccination) is safe even in immunocompromised people,’’ she explained, noting thatthere are now several vaccines being used globally.Bravo emphasized that no vaccine is 100 percent safe and is not 100 percent effective.\n",
      "She, however, emphasized that some vaccines prevent cancer and prevent the development of antibiotic resistance.\n",

      "Bravo also assured that the government is ready to deal with the adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccination.As the country has been coming to grips with the deadly effects of COVID-19 since its arrival in the Philippines from a couple in Wuhan, China in January 2020, Dr. Rontgene Solante, expert, Adult Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, said there is now increasing clinical experience and decreasing hospital volume.This has also led to lower viral load exposure due to the use of masks and social distancing, he added.\n",
      "But the COVID-19 pandemic now affects 106 million globally with the majority of cases are recorded in the US and Europe.\n",
      "Like Bravo, Solante said vaccines do more good than harm. He, likewise, rejects rumors that the vaccines produced by several pharmaceutical companies in the world were manufactured hastily.\n",
      "These vaccines underwent trials, he added.\n",
      "Solante noted that vaccines are more efficacious in older patients, from 60 years and above.Vaccines, according to him, have the ability to protect against severe diseases and mortality.\n",

      "The ministry said they are still reviewing the plans for the distribution of the vaccine in accordance with the recommended priorities.According to the Chinese embassy in Brunei, the sultanate’s Second Minister of Foreign Affairs Haji Erywan attended the handover ceremony on Tuesday and held a discussion with Yu Hong, Chinese ambassador to Brunei.\n",
      "Haji Erywan expressed his gratitude to China, saying that this is the first batch of COVID-19 vaccine received by Brunei, which is considered a gift given by the Chinese people to the people of Brunei, reflecting the long-term traditional friendship and deep mutual trust between the two countries.\n",
      "He said that the Chinese vaccine would play an important role for Brunei to overcome the epidemic. Brunei is willing to take the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries and the 30th anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations as an opportunity to promote bilateral relations and China-ASEAN relations to a new level, he added.\n",
      "Ambassador Yu told Haji Erywan that China’s COVID-19 vaccine assistance to Brunei reflects a new climax of bilateral cooperation against the COVID-19 pandemic.“At present, global COVID-19 vaccines are mainly distributed to a few developed countries, although the vaccines are crucial for all countries to restart their economies. Under such circumstances, China’s vaccine assistance to Brunei highlights the true friendship between our two countries,” the ambassador said during the discussion.\n",
      "Yu said that China has been earnestly acting on its pledge that once developed and deployed, Chinese vaccines will be made a global public good, contributing to the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in developing countries.\n",
      "“China is providing vaccine aid to 53 developing countries, and we have exported and are exporting vaccines to 22 countries. China also actively participates in the WHO-led COVAX and decided to provide 10 million doses of vaccines to the program, mainly to meet the demand of developing countries,” Yu said.“China supports domestic companies in conducting joint R&D and manufacturing with foreign partners, and in exporting vaccines to countries that are in urgent need of vaccines, have certified Chinese vaccines, and authorized their emergency use,” she added.\n",
      "According to the ambassador, China’s vaccine assistance to Brunei “fully reflects the high level of the China-Brunei strategic cooperative partnership and the true friendship between the two peoples.”\n",

      "“The CIDG, IG and National Operational Support Units will launch operations to prevent the entry, distribution and sale of COVID-9 vaccines without proper authorization from the concerned government agencies,” said Sinas.On Tuesday, the National Task Force on COVID-19, the Department of Health and the Food and Drugs Administration reminded the public that the selling of COVID-19 vaccines are prohibited.This, after reports have been circulating that COVID-19 vaccines are being sold in Manila and other parts of the country, the vaccines are believed to have been smuggled into the Philippines from other countries, especially China.\n",
      "The issue of smuggled COVID-10 vaccines, however, dragged Malacañang into controversy after the military admitted that soldiers assigned to the Presidential Security Group were already inoculated as early as last year, allegedly by smuggled vaccines.Based on the policy of the World Health Organization, only the governments could strike a deal for the purchase of COVID vaccines with pharmaceutical companies. Even local government units and private companies have to seek approval from the Philippine government for instance to buy the vaccines through a tripartite agreement—Government, pharmaceutical company and third party that include companies and LGUs.\n",
      "“As emphasized by DOH, NTF and FDA no particular brand of COVID-19 vaccine is authorized to be marketed commercially in the Philippines. The PNP will strictly implement this official policy, and take appropriate police action in accordance with existing laws,” said Sinas.\n",

      "The World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) issued interim recommendations for when and how to use the two-shot vaccine, which has yet to receive WHO emergency use authorization.\n",
      "The announcement came after the vaccine suffered setbacks, raising questions about whether it should be used on older people, or in places where a variant of the virus first found in South Africa is circulating.SAGE chief Alejandro Cravioto acknowledged the lack of data on the vaccine’s efficacy for people aged over 65, which has prompted a number of countries to withhold recommending its use in older people, who are by far the most vulnerable to the virus.\n",
      "But the experts concluded that given its performance with younger adults, “it is likely that the vaccine will be found to be efficacious in older persons. The trial data indicate that the vaccine is safe for this age group.”\n",
      "Cravioto told journalists: “We feel that the response of this group cannot be any different from groups of a younger age.”\n",
      "SAGE, he said, recommends it be used “for 18 years and above, without an upper age limit”.Cravioto said the experts were awaiting more specific data on the vaccine’s efficacy in people over 65, but said it “would not be appropriate” to wait with its recommendations.\n",
      "“We have thousands of people dying,” he stressed.\n",
      "“Anything we can do to use a product that might reduce that is totally justified, even if the information is not as complete as we would like.”\n",
      "Effectiveness against variantsThe experts also said they had discussed the effectiveness of the vaccine when faced with emerging coronavirus variants of concern, and in particular the one first spotted in South Africa.\n",
      "The country has decided to put off using AstraZeneca jabs in a planned vaccination programme over concerns about their efficacy against the variant.\n",
      "Alarm was raised when a South African study concluded the AstraZeneca vaccine provided only “minimal” protection against mild to moderate Covid-19 caused by the variant.\n",
      "But the WHO insisted more data was needed, pointing to the study’s scope, methodology and small size.\n",
      "And SAGE recommended Wednesday that the vaccine could be used “even if variants are present in a country”.The WHO’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the benefits would “far outweigh” any risks, as variants may not be the predominant strains circulating in that country.\n",
      "The SAGE experts also said the vaccine proved more effective when the interval between the doses was extended to between eight and 12 weeks.\n",
      "Equitable distribution\n",
      "The Covax system was set up by WHO, the Gavi vaccine alliance and CEPI to procure Covid-19 jabs and ensure their equitable distribution worldwide.\n",
      "The AstraZeneca vaccine accounts for almost all of the 337.2 million doses Covax is preparing to ship before July to some 145 countries, covering three percent of their combined population.\n",
      "However, the AstraZeneca jab first needs emergency use authorisation from the WHO, which is set to make a decision next week. Only the Pfizer vaccine has so far received the WHO stamp of approval.\n",
      "Gavi chief Seth Berkley called SAGE’s announcement, which clears a path towards authorisation, “excellent news”.\n",
      "“We will continue with our plans to roll this vaccine out worldwide,” he said.\n",
      "Andrew Pollard, from Oxford University’s Vaccine Group, meanwhile said SAGE’s recommendations were “an important milestone in extending access to the Oxford-AZ vaccine to all corners of the world.”\n",
      "But Thomas Cueni, head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, sounded a note of caution.\n",
      "Despite the industry’s desire for a swift and equitable rollout, “we warn against setting unrealistic expectations given the inherent risk of vaccine development and the complexity of scaling up manufacturing from scratch,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "COVAX is a coalition that includes the Vaccine Alliance known as Gavi and the World Health Organization (WHO) and is funded by donations from governments, multilateral institutions and foundations. It aims to procure COVID-19 vaccines in bulk and send them to poorer nations that are incapable of competing with wealthy countries in securing contracts with major drug companies.During their meeting, the Australian ambassador assured the secretaries that in the “spirit of mateship and Bayanihan”, the Embassy will do all it can to assist.\n",

      "In a letter addressed to Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III, Zamora asked if he could be the first person to take the jab in San Juan City in order to allay the fears of his constituents about the vaccines.\n",
      "“We very well understand that there is a prioritization list as identified by the IATF, on top of which are the health care workers and medical frontliners. However, the undersigned (Zamora) is volunteering in order to increase the trust and confidence of our citizens in the vaccination process and to encourage them to have themselves inoculated as well.” Zamora said in his letter.“The City of San Juan has been earnestly campaigning for people to register for the COVID-19 vaccine. In fact, we have started the online and offline registration as early as 4 January 2021. Unfortunately, as of this time, and after a month and six days, we only have a total of 18,602 registrants or just 15% of the city’s total population, still far from our target of 70% (85,526 people) to achieve herd immunity.” he added.\n",
      "Zamora, together with other city government officials, launched on Tuesday a house-to-house information drive on COVID-19 to increase the residents’ knowledge about the virus and the vaccines, and also to urge them to be inoculated against it.\n",
      "An on-the-spot online registration station was also set up for residents who have no access to the internet so they can be added to the city’s list of vaccine beneficiaries.\n",
      "During the visit of the Coordinated Operations to Defeat Epidemic (CODE) team to the city on Wednesday, the local government’s plans and initiatives in ensuring the smooth and efficient rollout of the vaccines was commended. The CODE team also lauded the city government’s strict implementation of the proper safety guidelines and health protocols in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in San Juan.

It is very uplifting that we will not be on survival mode anymore because the news of the vaccine, it’s like there’s a clear pathway that’s long-term. There’s light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.Pfizer and its partner BioNTech first announced the news about the vaccine and its efficacy rate in November. The vaccines produced by Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna were the first-ever to use mRNA, a technology that uses the cells’ memory to “remember” the virus rather than injecting a person with a live but weakened version of the virus.

Not to raise hope for the people of Manila but I am optimistic that it will arrive soon, sooner than expected,” he told reporters on Monday.The Manila city government entered a tripartite agreement with British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 for the advanced purchase of 800,000 vaccines.This is seen to benefit around 400,000 people. Frontline health workers, senior citizens and members of other vulnerable sectors, uniformed personnel, public school teachers, and church workers are among the city government’s priority list for the vaccine.Next to be inoculated are those who pre-registered at the manilacovid19vaccine.com. As of Monday, over 80,000 people have reserved their slots at the website.The Manila mayor said they are nearly done in constructing the city’s COVID-19 Vaccine Storage Facility at the 7th floor of Sta.

      "These include five Haier HYC-390 refrigeration units which can store vaccine doses from AstraZeneca and Sinovac, four other biomedical freezers which can store Janssen and Moderna vaccine vials, and three -86 degrees celsius ULT Freezers from Haier which can store Pfizer vaccines.\n",
      "The city government also acquired 50 transport coolers that will be used to deliver the vaccines.Vaccination simulation activities are also being conducted in the city to identify possible problems that they may arise during the actual vaccination drive.

      "With the country’s coronavirus vaccine confidence still low, Vice President and opposition leader Leni Robredo said the government should let health experts do the talking on the safety of vaccines.\n",
      "(JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“We should listen to health experts. They should be the ones assuring the people. The doctors, the ones who understand (how the vaccines work) should be the ones doing the talking. Not us, because we are not health experts,” she said in Filipino over dzXL Sunday, Feb. 7.\n",
      "The vice president urged health experts “to go out in public” to assure the people that it is safe to take the vaccine.Robredo lamented that the latest survey showed that 47 percent of the respondents refused to be inoculated with the vaccine, which the government hopes to start rolling out this month.\n",
      "“This is worrisome because if the 47 percent don’t like, how can we achieve (herd immunity)?,” she said, referring to the inoculation of a large part of the population to make a large swath of people immune to the virus.Robredo believes that information drive is lacking. “The confidence level of the people (on the vaccine) is still very low. I think we are lacking in terms of communication. Our information campaign should be aggressive.”\n",
      "The vice president reiterated that the people need assurance that the vaccine is safe.“We should strengthen the communication (with people) because if there is no confidence, even if the vaccine is there, we will not achieve herd immunity,” she said.The Philippines expects the first tranche of China-made Sinovac vaccines to arrive this month, with health workers, seniors, people with co-morbidities, and uniformed personnel as the first in line to get the vaccine.But even as the start of the vaccination program looms near, polls showed that nearly half of Filipinos will not get vaccinated against COVID-19 because of safety concerns.Out of 2,400 Filipino adults who took the survey, only 32 percent said they are willing to be vaccinated while 21 percent are undecided. The biggest concern is the safety of the virus. That’s followed by concerns about its price while some believe that a vaccine is not needed to combat the coronavirus. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) has allowed mining companies to re-align their social development funds the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.MGB has released a memorandum allowing mining companies to use their funds under SDMP and Safety and Health Program (SHP) for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccine for the mass vaccination within mining communities.The memorandum aims to help the government in purchasing an additional supply of COVID-19 vaccines through the initiatives of the mining industry.Such a decision was made upon the request of some mining companies to the government, though no official lobby has been made. These funds include those for existing programs their annual Social Development and Management Program (SDMP).In a text message, Rocky Dimaculangan, vice president for corporate communications at Chamber of Mines of the Philippines (COMP), said many COMP members did request the MGB’s permission for the realignment of funds “given that mass immunization from the deadly virus is our nation’s most pressing concern at the moment”. \n",
      "“We entrust the procurement and administration of the vaccine to our members who have a better sense of the situation on the ground,” Dimaculangan said.“We encourage the widest possible coverage of the vaccination campaign and will monitor the progress of our members’ vaccination program,” he added.COMP is composed of some of the largest mining companies in the Philippines.For his part, MGB Director Wilfredo Moncano said there was no official lobby made by mining companies regarding the decision of the agency.\n",
      "“We just thought that since in 2020 we allowed the re-alignment of SDMP funds for COVID-19 response by mining companies, it will also be logical that MGB can allow the re-alignment of said funds in 2021 for the procurement of the vaccine,” Moncano said in a separate text exchange.“We welcome the MGB decision allowing the minerals development industry to realign SDMP and SHP funds for the vaccination of employees and members of host communities. This will provide a big boost to the government’s Covid-19 vaccination program and help hasten the nation’s recovery from this pandemic,” Dimaculangan said. \n",
      "Moncano noted, however, that mining companies should first consult with the representatives from their respective host and neighboring communities to avoid redundancy in the vaccination.This, as the host local government unit (LGU) may have already allotted its own funds for the vaccine procurement.He also said that it’s the host communities that will be the one to determine what projects, programs, or activities that will be deferred or canceled amid the re-alignment of the SDMP fund allocation.The SDMP requires mining companies to set aside funds for the development and implementation of community programs, projects, and activities for the host and neighboring communities of a mining project.This is a five-year plan geared towards the development of a responsible, self-reliant, and resource-based community capable of developing, implementing, and managing development programs, projects, and activities.

The list of priority recipients has been expanded by the government pandemic task force ahead of the arrival of the supplies this month.\n",

But I said, let’s trust our doctors to issue the certificates. They will not lie because we really have high respect for our doctors),” he said over DZBB Sunday, Feb. 7.\n",
      "Roque explained that persons with comorbidity such as diabetes and heart disease are among the priority recipients since they are vulnerable to contracting the new coronavirus disease.“Talagang ipinaglaban ko po iyan, kasi alam naman natin na sang-ayon sa siyensiya hindi lang matatanda ang vulnerable dito sa sakit na ito, eh kasama rin iyong mga may comorbidities (I really fought for that because we know that based on science, it is not just the old people who are vulnerable to the coronavirus illness. Those with comorbidities are also at risk),” he said.Frontline workers in health facilities and senior citizens will be the first and second recipients of the free vaccines from the government. The revised list of beneficiaries include frontline essential personnel such as uniformed forces, poor citizens, teachers and social workers, overseas Filipino workers, other workers, and the rest of the Filipino population.\n",
      "Roque also said media workers are likely to be included in the priority group of essential workers.\n",
      "He noted that the “economic frontliners” are those working in industries allowed to operate during the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). Media companies continued operations even though the government enforced a strict lockdown last year.“Iyong sinasabi ninyo siguro iyong mga economic frontliners, ito kasi iyong mga industriya na hindi sarado noong ECQ at kasama doon sa hindi sarado ay iyong mga news. ‘Di ba po, naalala ninyo ano, na maski ECQ kayo ay bukas?

Instead of criticizing, join us in giving the right information to our people about the importance of vaccines, that they should not be afraid and instead trust them),” he said.He said the government, though the Presidential Communications Operations Office, also remains committed to educate the public about vaccination program.The PCOO, led by Secretary Martin Andanar, has already launched its “Explain, Explain, Explain” information drive, that includes town hall meetings, to help convince people to get inoculated against COVID-19.The government has secured over a hundred million doses of coronavirus vaccines to benefit all Filipino adults in the country.\n",

      "Dr. Edsel Maurice T. SalvanaThe global push for safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 has led to a bumper crop of vaccine candidates. With over 200 COVID-19 vaccines in development and at least 10 vaccines completing or about to complete phase 3 clinical trials, which vaccine is the best?\n",
      "In last week’s column, I emphasized that for those in imminent danger of severe COVID-19 should get vaccinated as soon as possible with whatever properly approved vaccine is available. This will be the case in the short term as global demand outstrips supply. As supply chains catch up and more vaccines are proven to work, we will get to the point where we can choose the most appropriate vaccine for each of us.\n",
      "NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK Dr. Nita Patel, Director of Antibody discovery and Vaccine development, lifts a vial with a potential COVID 19 vaccine at Novavax labs in Gaithersburg, Maryland on March 20, 2020\n",
      "(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds)\n",
      "COVID-19 vaccines fall under one of six categories. These are the categories.\n",
      "a. Nucleic acid-based vaccines use viral genetic material, whether RNA or DNA. This includes the mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna.b. Inactivated virus vaccines use killed whole virus. This vaccine type includes Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines.c. Recombinant viral vectored vaccines use a harmless live virus as a carrier for the target virus’ genetic material to induce an immune response. Current COVID-19 vaccines using this technology use live but non-replicating carrier viruses like adenovirus 5 or adenovirus 26. Examples are vaccines from Astra, Cansino, J&J, and Gamaleya.d. Protein subunit vaccines use a piece of the virus, usually the spike protein, to generate an immune response.\n",
      "e. Virus-like particle vaccines use artificial construct or structure that mimics real viruses and the body’s immune system responds accordingly.f. Live attenuated virus vaccines use a weakened form of the target virus to induce the immune response.Each of these categories come with advantages and disadvantages. Broadly speaking, only live attenuated viruses are able to reproduce. Recombinant viral vectors are alive, but are not able to reproduce. The rest of the vaccines are neither live nor able to replicate. These vaccine characteristics have important implications on the ability of the vaccine to produce robust immunity. This also impacts which patient populations can be safely inoculated with them.\n",
      "Live replicating virus vaccines\n",
      "Live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines are still in development and are not yet in clinical trials. This kind of vaccine is the most likely to be transmission-blocking because they mimic natural infection better than any of the other vaccines. These vaccines, however, are also the ones that can rarely inadvertently cause a form of the disease in susceptible hosts.\n",
      "The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is an example of a live attenuated vaccine. OPV worked so well that natural polio infections were nearly eliminated. Once the level of natural polio infections drastically dropped due to the potency of OPV, the number of people who developed an atypical form of polio from the OPVoutnumbered the ones who actually got polio from natural infection. This is why in places where polio cases are low, the recommended polio vaccine is switched to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). This is because IPV does not have the danger of inadvertently causing an atypical form of polio and its main effect is to prevent the severe form of polio. IPV, however, does not block polio transmission. When there is a polio outbreak, live OPV is deployed to block transmission and extinguish the outbreak.\n",
      "There is a lot of interest in live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines because these may be the ones that are more likely to generate herd immunity by being transmission blocking. They may also work better in children since kids have immature immune systems and may require a more robust active ingredient in a vaccine.Live non-replicating virus vaccineThe Astra, Cansino, J&J, and Gamaleya vaccines all use modified adenoviruses. These viruses are engineered to be unable to reproduce in humans but they contain part of the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or other viral parts. The adenovirus inserts the target genetic sequence into the host cell, which then makes virus parts that are recognized by the immune system. Using a live vector produces a whole gamut of immune responses, which may lead to more robust and longer-lasting protection.Using a non-replicating virus as a carrier is safer than a live attenuated virus because there is virtually no possibility of the carrier virus causing the actual disease. Live vaccines, however, even non-replicating ones should be used with caution among patients with weakened immune systems. These patients may not be able to overcome the live vaccines and may inadvertently develop disease if their body is unable to control even a weakened virus. Non-replicating viral vector vaccines are still relatively new, and so these should still be used with caution among people with diminished immune responses.Non-live non-replicating\n",
      "The rest of the vaccine types are not live and are not replicating. These vaccines are considered safe even for people with underlying immune problems. One disadvantage is that some of these vaccines, such as the inactivated virus or protein subunit vaccines, may not induce as strong an immune response as the live vaccines.\n",
      "Virus-like particles (VLPs) and mRNA vaccines address this problem using novel delivery mechanisms and innovative techniques. VLPs use recombinant technology and have been used in the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines against cervical cancer. These mimic real viruses by maximizing immune responses but eliminate the risk of using a live virus.\n",
      "Nucleic acid-based vaccines like mRNA vaccines are not a new concept but the difficulty has been in ensuring that the nucleic acid molecules get into the cells intact. Once inside the cell, the body processes the mRNA into proteins and these proteins trigger the immune response. Our body makes millions of copies of proteins from our own mRNA, and the added protein production from an mRNA vaccine is a mere fraction of what the body handles in a day. The effectiveness of mRNA vaccines is from the large number of protein particles it generates. These proteins find their way into both the intracellular and extracellular compartments and induce a robust immune response. Allergic reactions that are seen in some people may be due to the novel lipid nanoparticle carriers used rather than the mRNA itself. These allergic reactions are being thoroughly investigated to identify any specific risks. Otherwise, mRNA vaccines are reasonably safe and effective.\n",
      "The main advantage of using inactivated whole virus vaccines is that this is reasonably safe and proven technology.\n",
      "These, however, may not induce as robust an immune response compared to live viruses. The ability to block transmission and mild disease may not be as high as that of live vaccines or mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the ability to prevent severe disease means that these vaccines may be best used for very frail people who need protection from severe disease but may not be able to tolerate live vaccines or the exuberant immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines. One other advantage of using the entire deactivated virus over using pieces or parts of it (VLPs, mRNA, protein subunit, recombinant vector) is that there is a large diversity of antigens available to induce an immune response. This large repertoire of antibodies may render the vaccine more resistant to escape mutations from the emerging new variants.\n",
      "There remain a lot of unknowns on how the different types of vaccines work against COVID-19.\n",
      "One of the most important questions is how long the protection will last. The longest amount of time that trial subjects have been observed from the early phase one trials is less than one year. We won’t know until after a year has passed whether these vaccines will need a booster later. The emergence of vaccine escape mutations is a concerning development. Vaccines can be “fixed,” however, by incorporating new sequences and new variants into the existing vaccines.\n",
      "The plethora of vaccines being developed for COVID-19 can sometimes confuse people and make them more vaccine hesitant. At this time, there is no “best” vaccine and there is no “more appropriate” vaccine since we still have very little data. For the most at risk, especially frontliners and the elderly, the best vaccine is the vaccine you can get as soon as possible. When a vaccine is offered to you and you have questions, talk to your doctor about your risk and whether you can afford to wait or not.

      "“We already requested a meeting with the DOH to make the request. We really hope the additional Pfizer doses will be granted for our health care workers,” Galvez said.\n",

Precious ito (These are very precious). We were really nervous because we saw that only 20 percent of the global supply remained for the first and second quarter. We are happy that the WHO and Gavi managed to secure vaccines for our needs,” Galvez said.\n",

      "While the country is getting ready to implement its COVID-19 vaccination program, Dr. Leonila Dans, a clinical epidemiologist and pediatrician at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), said that children are not yet included in the vaccination schedule.\n",
      "(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)In a webinar entitled, “Who Should Not be Vaccinated for COVID-19?” organized by the by the University of the Philippines (UP) in partnership with the National Telehealth Center on Friday, Feb. 5, Dans emphasized that children should not be included in any COVID-19 vaccination initiatives because there is “no vaccine” that has been developed for the younger age group to date.\n",
      "“At this point, children are not yet included among those who will receive the vaccine,” Dans said. “This is because when we do administer or grade the evidence, we depend a lot on the clinical trials that were performed for the new drugs or the vaccines that are being in question or being evaluated,” she added.\n",
      "So far, Dans said that only one vaccine, Pfizer, has included older adolescents or 16 years old and above in their clinical trials. “At this point, only this vaccine might be used in older children,” she explained.\n",
      "However, Dans reminded that for younger children or those 16 years old and below – especially for other vaccines that started 18 years and above for their clinical trials – vaccination is “definitely not yet allowed” at this time.\n",
      "“It’s not because we don’t want to include them, it’s just because the vaccine for them is still being studied,” Dans said. “The use of vaccines in the younger age group is still being studied and eventually, maybe the children will still be vaccinated with this new vaccine,” she added.\n",
      "Dans also discussed that should children be allowed to get vaccinated for COVID-19 in the future, there will also be special considerations during routine immunizations.\n",
      "For instance, Dans said that caution should be observed when administering COVID-19 for children with severe allergies or history of anaphylaxis, those with bleeding disorders, and for immunocompromised children or those on immunosuppressants. “You have to discuss this with your physicians even when your children are receiving routine immunizations – especially for COVID-19 vaccines,” she added.\n",
      "Dans said that parents should also consider delaying – for two weeks or up to one month – availing of vaccines for children who have “received immunoglobulins or blood products or those with severe illnesses.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Her presentation focused on the importance of having older people vaccinated to stop COVID deaths. “Older people are the best candidates for COVID vaccination especially because many have chronic diseases that predispose them to complications in death,” Dela Vega said.Citing studies, Dela Vega explained that “most deaths are among older persons” both in the country and worldwide. Globally, she noted that for people 50 to 80 years old, the death rate is between 0.4 to 20.2 percent. In the Philippines, most deaths are people from 65 years and older with 81.5 percent.\n",
      "Aside from age, Dela Vega noted that older people are at risk of severe COVID because there are morbidities of chronic diseases that “predispose older persons to mortality, hospitalization, and other complications” such as hypertension, diabetes, cancers, and obesity – among others.\n",
      "Given this, Dela Vega urged older people to “get listed and be vaccinated” especially if they have one or more chronic and degenerative disease.\n",
      "Dela Vega noted that one of the most common concerns of the people – in general – on getting vaccinated for COVID-19 is safety. Thus, she reassured them that “COVID-19 vaccines are generally safe.” She added that “only the most effective vaccine brand will be recommended” for them.On the other hand, Dela Vega explained that frailest and near the end of life may also “receive the vaccine especially in nursing homes where strict infection control is necessary.”\n",

Jesus Durante III that the PSG was able to get COVID-19 vaccines and have its personnel vaccinated to better protect Duterte from getting infected with the virus.But Guevarra had already clarified that his order for the NBI to conduct the investigation was not prompted by the reports on the vaccination conducted on PSG security personnel.

      "The trial will show whether different Covid doses — those created by the Astrazeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech pharmaceutical companies — can be used interchangeably to allow greater flexibility in pressured vaccine delivery schedules.\n",
      "The British government’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said the trial would offer “greater insight” into the use of vaccines against Covid.“Given the inevitable challenges of immunising large numbers of the population against Covid-19 and potential global supply constraints, there are definite advantages to having data that could support a more flexible immunisation programme,” Van-Tam said.\n",
      "“It is also even possible that by combining vaccines, the immune response could be enhanced giving even higher antibody levels that last longer,” he added.\n",
      "The 13-month study will compare different combinations of prime and booster doses of the Astrazeneca and Pfizer vaccines at intervals of four and 12 weeks.\n",
      "Britain, the first western nation to launch its vaccination programme, has bucked the international trend by administering vaccines at an interval of 12 weeks in a bid to give a first dose of the vaccine to more individuals.Professor Matthew Snape from Oxford University called the study “extremely exciting”, adding that it would provide “information vital to the roll out of vaccines in the UK and globally”.If the study shows positive results, Britain’s independent medicines regulator would formally assess the safety and efficacy of any new vaccination regimen before it is rolled out to patients. Disagreements between the UK and the European Union over vaccine supplies have boiled over in recent weeks with Brussels moving to restrict vaccine exports to Northern Ireland on Thursday before the plans were abandoned in a swift U-turn.In the following days, EU member states and the European Commission have continued to criticise the English-Swedish drugs manufacturer AstraZeneca over slow vaccine delivery and the efficacy of the jab has also been called into question.On Wednesday, the British government seized on a separate study that said the AstraZeneca vaccine — which was developed in partnership with Oxford University — significantly reduces virus transmission and is highly protective after a single dose.\n",

      "The Department of Health (DOH) welcomed Wednesday, February 3,the significant developments in the coronavirus vaccines developed by pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and the Gamaleya Research Institute of Russia.Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario S. Vergeire (PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The J&J recently announced that its single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is 85-percent effective in preventing severe disease.\n",
      "“Magandang balita iyan, hindi lang sa ating bansa kung hindi sa lahat ng bansa kung magkakaroon nga ng ganitong bakuna na isang dose nalang po [That is good news, not only for our country butfor other countries as well—- if there is really a vaccine that will only require a single shot],” said DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire during the televised “Laging Handa” briefing.\n",
      "“Unang-una, operationally, napaka simple na ng gagawin, wala na tayong hahantayin na period of time para makapagpabakuna for the second dose. At dito sinasabi din, isang turok lang sayo, makukuha mo na yung efficacy na kinakailangan ng isang katawan para ikaw ay maproteksyunan [First of all, operationally, it is very simple to do, we do not have to wait for a certain period of time to get vaccinated for the second dose. And with just one dose, you can get the protection that your body needs],” she added.Vergeire said the Philippine government has ongoing negotiations with J&Jto secure doses of the pharmaceutical firm’s COVID-19 vaccines.Meanwhile, the DOH spokesperson also lauded the recent announcement of Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute that the efficacy of Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19 is at 91.6 percent.“Itong 91 percent na efficacy…ito po ay magandang balita at sana tayo ay magkaroon ng ganitong bakuna din kasama nung ibang mga bakuna to provide additional protection for our population [This 91 percent efficacy … this is good news and hopefully, we will have this vaccine as well as other vaccines to provide additional protection for our population],” said Vergeire.\n",
      "However, all COVID-19 vaccines that will enter the Philippines must first be scrutinized by the country’s health regulators.“Katulad ng lagi nating sinasabi bago tayo magpapasok (ng bakuna) sa ating bansa, kailangan dumaan sa ating regulatory process so we can doubly ensure na ito ay ligtas at saka magiging epektibo para ating populasyon [As we always say before we allow a vaccine to be used into our country, they have to go through our regulatory process first so we can doubly ensure that it is safe and it will be effective for our population],” said Vergeire.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“Ang sinasabi ng mga eksperto kapag mas pinatagal po natin itong pagbibigay ng second dose compared doon sa required na dosing schedule, baka magkaroon ng tinatawag na escaped mutation na maaaring makaapekto doon sa efficacy (rate) ng bakuna [Experts say that if we prolong the administration of the second dose compared to the required dosing schedule, there may be a so-called escaped mutation that could affect the efficacy (rate) of the vaccine],” said DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.To avoid this, it is imperative to follow the recommendation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the dosing schedule.\n",
      "The FDA has so far approved coronavirus vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca for emergency use in the Philippines. The two vaccines have different dosing schedules, said Vergeire.The second dose ofthe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be given21 days after the first dose was administered. For AstraZeneca, the second dose is administered four to 12 weeks after the first dose was given, said Vergeire.\n",
      "“Mas maganda na po na susundin na natin iyong schedule na sinabi ng EUA (emergency use authorization) at iyong indikasyon noong bakuna na iyon [It would be better if we follow the schedule stated by the EUA or the vaccine’s indication],” said Vergeire.\n",
      "Case updateOn Wednesday, the DOH confirmed additional 1,266cases of COVID-19 nationwide.The total number of cases in the country since the pandemic began has already reached 530,118, of which, 31,445 are still active cases.Meanwhile,there were a total of 487,721 people who have recovered from the disease, including the 130 new survivors that were recorded by the DOH.However, 68 new deaths related to COVID-19 were reported, raising the death toll to 10,942.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "An online survey conducted by a team of researchers from the University of Santo Tomas (UST) has shown that only 56 percent of Filipinos were willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n",
      "The UST-CoVAX Vaccine Awareness Team, led by Fr. Nicanor Austriaco, surveyed about 15,600 respondents in January to find out the beliefs and perceptions of the Filipino people regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.\n",

      "In a DZMM Teleradyo interview, Austriaco pointed out that those who said they were unsure, where either nervous or scared to get inoculated against COVID-19.\n",
      "He underscored the government’s role to convince Filipinos that getting inoculated is safe.“Remember, we have to vaccinate 100 percent of Filipinos to end this pandemic. Fifty percent is not good enough. We have to work to convince more of them to want to be vaccinated. Our survey showed that many are scared about the vaccine and its safety. They are worried that it will not work or make them sick. They are worried about fake vaccines. There are many worries so the government has to reassure us all that the worries are not real. That they are worth the risk for our families,” he explained.\n",

      "The announcement comes as Ottawa grapples with delays in deliveries of doses sourced from Europe.\n",
      "Canada has contracted with Novavax for up to 76 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, but its health regulator has yet to approve its use.“Canada will now be well-placed to produce vaccines for Canadians at home, and in the best case scenario if we don’t need it here in Canada, we will be able to offer doses to our allies or partners in developing countries around the world because this pandemic won’t be over until everyone has been vaccinated,” Trudeau told a news conference.\n",
      "The Canadian government and Novavax, the prime minister said, signed a memorandum of understanding to set up new production in Montreal.The company said its vaccine, which requires two doses, has proven to be 89.3 percent effective in clinical trials.\n",
      "Construction of the National Research Council’s Biologics Manufacturing Centre that will house Novavax’s vaccine production is already underway, and is expected to be completed in July.It will be capable of producing two million doses per month.\n",
      "The government also announced an agreement with Vancouver-based Precision NanoSystems to build a biomanufacturing centre to make up to 240 million doses of RNA Covid-19 vaccines per year. It is targeted for completion in March 2023.\n",
      "Trudeau has said that most Canadians would be inoculated against the coronavirus by September.But recent deliveries of the first two vaccines to get regulatory approval in December — made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna at plants in Europe — have been delayed by several weeks.\n",
      "So far, according to the latest government figures, almost one million Canadians have received a first of two required doses of these two vaccines. Less than 120,000 have received both shots needed for immunity, said public broadcaster CBC.\n",

      "PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar (PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Andanar highlighted on Tuesday the benefits of the government’s immunization drive as part of PCOO’s intensified campaign to convince more Filipinos to get vaccinated.\n",
      "Senate President Vicente Sotto III earlier asked the PCOO to step up efforts to inform the people about the vaccines and dispel fake news about these products. Sotto claimed that many people were scared to get inoculated due to speculations that such vaccines were supposedly not safe and ineffective.In a statement, Andanar said the PCOO would continue to “educate and enlighten” the public about the immunization drive through traditional and social media and counter the disinformation about such vaccines.“We want to deliver to them the message that the vaccination program can save lives, revive hopes, and shape our collective future as a nation,” he said.\n",
      "“We will continue our intensified communications and information campaigns in order to inform every Filipino and assist the national government in the rollout and implementation of our national vaccination program so that we can heal, recover, and rise as one nation,” he said.\n",
      "Andanar said he sympathized with Sotto’s statement about the apprehension among some Filipinos to receive coronavirus vaccines. He recognized that the lack of understanding about the vaccines remained “a widespread problem.”“This gets further complicated with misinformation and disinformation by some individuals and groups who claim that vaccination is not an ideal and safe option for virus immunization,” he said.\n",
      "He said the PCOO would help bring “knowledge and clarity” about the vaccines through its programs such as the “Laging Handa” activities, town hall meetings, and media literacy training.\n",
      "“As the lead communications arm of the Duterte administration, we in the PCOO have been undertaking communications and information campaigns not only on the COVID-19 pandemic, but also on the upcoming rollout of our national vaccination program,” he said.A Pulse Asia survey recently showed that nearly half of Filipinos are unwilling to be vaccinated due to safety concerns. In the survey conduced last November, 47 percent of the 2,400 respondents said they do not want to vaccinated, 32 percent are willing, and 21 percent are undecided.Safety concern is the top reason given by respondents who are reluctant to receive the vaccines.\n",
      "The Philippines plans to secure 178 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines enough to inoculate 92 million people, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez recently said. The figure is more than the target of 148 million doses this year in anticipation of the delays in the delivery of the supplies, Dominguez said. The government has set aside $1.38 billion in funding from multilateral agencies to bankroll the vaccine procurement.An initial 3 million doses are expected to arrive this month while the bulk of the supply will be delivered third and fourth quarters of the year.

      "A Filipino-American molecular biologist and priest is looking into the development of a yeast-based COVID-19 vaccine to offer a cheaper alternative for the Filipinos.\n",
      "Rev. Fr. Nicanor Pier Giorgo Austriaco (CBHD)\n",
      "Rev. Fr. Nicanor Pier Giorgo Austriaco, O.PPh.D., S. Th. D., who is currently a visiting professor of Biological Sciences at the University of the Santo Tomas (UST), confirmed that he is working on a COVID-19 vaccine that is yeast-based.\n",
      "“We are working on a yeast-based oral vaccine for Filipinos that will be cheaper and can be transported without refrigeration,” Austriaco said in a presentation during the 121st Plenary Assembly of Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) held last week.Austriaco, who is also a professor of Biology and of Theology, started to bring his molecular biology expertise into the Philippines’ fight against COVID-19 in 2020. As a fellow of the OCTA Research team, he is also very much involved in pandemic management for the country.\n",
      "In his presentation entitled, “The Science and Ethics of COVID-19 Vaccines,” Austriaco, discussed how COVID-19 vaccines work, which vaccines will be available in the Philippines and when will these arrive in the country.\n",
      "He also discussed “ethical consideration” to clarify misconceptions on the COVID-19 vaccines that are currently developed.\n",
      "“The key message here is antibodies destroy SARS-CoV2,” Austriaco explained.“The reason why the pandemic was so devastating around the world – with 100 million have been affected by SARS-CoV2 in less than a year – is because no one has any antibodies against SARS-CoV2,” he added.\n",
      "For the Philippines, Austriaco vaccines are expected to from the West including Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca; the Gamelaya from Russia; and the Sinovac and Sinopharm from China.\n",
      "Austriaco also discussed the challenges in the different vaccines – including storage issues and efficacy – among others. Some vaccines need freezers such as Pfizer while others such as Gamelayaa nd AstraZeneca can be stored in regular fridge temperatures.When it comes to efficacy, he noted that Moderna, Pfizer, and Russian vaccines are “relatively good.” AstraZeneca’s efficacy, he added, ranges from 60 to 90 percent. “The standard approved protocols for the UK is 62 percent – this is what we would be expecting to use in the Philippines,” he added. The Chinese vaccines, on the other hand, have 78 to 91% and can be “kept in the refrigerators that are usually used at home.”\n",
      "Austriaco also touched on ethical considerations in the vaccines – noting that some vaccines used cells obtained from the remains of an “aborted female fetus” in 1973.“What is clear is that we will not be morally-compromised if we choose vaccines that were made using these cells because there were no actual parts used, none of these are injected into you because they were all destroyed in the process of making the vaccine,” he explained.\n",
      "Enormous challenges of the vaccination\n",
      "As the country prepares for the roll out of its COVID-19 mass vaccination program, Austriaco pointed out some of the challenges in its implementation.“It will be the largest and most complex public health effort in the history of the Philippines and will especially benefit the poor and most vulnerable among us,” Austriaco said.\n",
      "He also pointed out that there will be a need to vaccinate at least 75 million people – every single Filipino adult – scattered over our 7,000 plus islands. “It is such a big logistical problem and a critical problem for the country,” he said. “We will have to vaccinate most of them twice within a month,” he added.\n",

      "According to the President, the country’s “greatest disadvantage” was being poor, but his government was able to allocate funds to secure vaccines for majority of Filipinos.“Alam mo ho itong problema talaga ng COVID hindi ganoon kadali. For one, ang greatest disadvantage natin is hindi tayo mayaman at ito labanan ito ngayon sa highest bidder nga (You the problem with COVID is it’s not that easy. For one, our greatest disadvantage is we are not rich and it is now a fight for the highest bidder),” Duterte said.\n",
      "“Kung sino ‘yung makabayad ng una, mag-deposito na, tapos lalo na kung ‘yung bansa na ‘yon ang humihingi ng supply ng vaccine is the country where the factory is located — tawagin natin factory — nandiyan, nauuna talaga sa kanila (Whoever can pay first, make a deposit, especially if the country seeking the vaccine supply is the country where the factor is located, they really get ahead of the line),” he added.\n",
      "As countries go on buying sprees for the most promising COVID vaccines, the President was optimistic that the cost of these vaccines will eventually stabilize.“Iyong mga price-price haggling lang ‘yan eventually ‘yung mag-taper off ‘yan into a uniformity sa prices (The price haggling will eventually taper off into a uniformity of prices),” he said.Duterte also told the nation “not to worry” about the vaccination program, saying the government, through vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., continues to negotiate for ample vaccines from suppliers.He also said the government has secured funds for vaccine procurement, citing the financial aid from multilateral lenders such as World Bank and Asian Development Bank.\n",

      "(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)Albay Rep. Joey Sarte Salceda, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, made this disclosure as the bicameral conference committee on the proposed Corporate Reform and Tax Incentives Reform (CREATE)Act is set to submit its recommendation for the consolidation of the House and Senate versions of the bill.\n",

      "The lawmaker said approval of the measure will help expedite COVID-19 procurement, especially by the private sector.\n",
      "“Vaccine rollout is the most important economic stimulus measure. We are happy to report that CREATE/CITIRA will also help get it done,” Salceda stated.On the part of the House, the major items the Senate concurred with are: shorter incentives for domestic enterprises, stringent controls against illicit trade in certain ecozones, and longer incentives for all areas outside of NCR.\n",
      "“Once the revenue estimates are out, I believe we will have saved likely P100-120 billion in foregone revenues compared to the initial Senate version,” the House panel chairman stated.\n",
      "Salceda also stressed that he is “particularly proud of the incentives for countryside enterprises, and tax savings from incentives for domestic enterprises.”“My greatest fear, on the revenue side, was how redundant tax incentives for domestic enterprises were,” the veteran administration solon said.\n",
      "According to him at least US$18 billion in foreign direct investments (FDIs) were lost over the “past three years of uncertainty over the delays in passing” the measure.\n",
      "“Now that it’s done, I expect the investment overhang to close. Investors can now stand on more solid footing,” Salceda said.\n",
      "“As far as investment uncertainty over tax regime is concerned, that’s finished. The Secretariats are now preparing the final copy as we speak. We will sign this weekend, and ratify by Monday or Tuesday,” Salceda added.\n",
      "According to Salceda, one key concession his panel was able to obtain from the Senate is that domestic enterprises will be able to avail of 5 years shorter special corporate income tax (SCIT) or enhanced deductions compared to the Senate version. Additionally, they have to have an investment capital of at least P500 million to qualify for the SCIT.\n",
      "As for critical domestic industries, they will be able to avail of incentives similar to those of export enterprises. The industries qualified as “critical” will be determined by the National Economic Development Authority, as “arbiter between fiscal health and industrial development,” as Salceda described.

      "More used to wielding a camera than a needle, taking part in a national vaccination campaign was the “last thing” documentary director Mike Day expected to be doing before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson today (January 28th) visited the French biotechnology laboratory Valneva in Livingston where they will be producing a Covid 19 vaccine on a large scale. The Prime Minister tried his hand at one of the tests with Kerri Symington, quality control technician. (Photo by Wattie Cheung / POOL / AFP)\n",
      "But the 41-year-old is no one of an army of volunteers — many with no medical qualifications — being recruited to help deliver Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s goal of vaccinating 15 million of those most at risk from the virus by mid-February.\n",
      "“When I had the opportunity to do something that made a difference I definitely wanted to jump at it so I immediately signed up when I heard about it,” Day told AFP at a training session for 120 volunteers at Canary Wharf in east London on Saturday.Volunteers, wearing masks and gloves, were instructed how to administer the jab on the 32nd floor of one of the business district’s skyscrapers, its windows commanding views of uninterrupted, rainswept grey skies.\n",
      "“Aaah!” shouted one instructor, prompting laughter from the audience of volunteers as one participant stuck a needle into the false shoulder tied around her arm.\n",
      "Another instructor from the St John Ambulance service, which specialises in first aid education, told the volunteers to push the needle “deep into the muscle”.\n",
      "“Without sounding too cheesy I thought this was a great opportunity to come together to help heal the world,” office assistant Katherine Odell, explained.The 35-year-old said she wasn’t afraid of going out to administer the shot despite the amount of information she has to assimilate.\n",
      "She admitted there was “always a risk” when faced with the disease but you “keep to the rules as much as you can”.\n",
      "Eimear Herlihy, 31, explained she was used to seeing patients every day as a dentist.“I’m just really eager for things to go back to normal, so any way that I can help I want to be able to help,” she added.\n",
      "A 19-year-old medical student at Cambridge University, Shaun Wilson said it was “exciting” to take the theory he had learned and “apply it into something that really can make a difference”.\n",
      "– ‘Absolutely essential’ –\n",
      "Volunteers from all walks of life are among the 30,000 individuals who will be recruited by St John Ambulance to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines currently authorised for general use in UK vaccination centres.\n",
      "To qualify for the volunteer programme, recruits must be over the age of 18 with a secondary school education and pass a criminal background check.\n",
      "In a separate room, with their chairs carefully spaced to keep to social distancing rules, another group of volunteers is learning how they will inspire confidence in those about to receive their vaccines.They are also instructed how to wash their hands thoroughly, safely remove their personal protective equipment and give first aid.\n",
      "“One of the associated risks, and a very small associated risk with vaccination, is anaphylaxis, having a severe allergic reaction,” Carl Fazackerley, a St John Ambulance instructor told AFP.\n",
      "“The screening will have been done by NHS colleagues before,” he added, referring to Britain’s state-run National Health Service. “So this shouldn’t happen, but it’s about being ready to deal with it if it does.”\n",
      "The training day in Canary Wharf, which is replicated regularly across the UK, allows knowledge acquired during 15 hours of online courses to be put into practice. At the end of their instruction, the volunteers are immersed in a fake vaccination centre.\n",
      "“Volunteers are absolutely essential to this vaccination programme because what they bring is scale and capacity,” Fazackerley explained.\n",
      "“The NHS is already under pressure from Covid and to ask the NHS on its own this vaccination would be an impossible task,” he added.\n",
      "More than 8.9 million people have already received a first dose of the vaccine in the United Kingdom, the first Western country to launch a massive vaccination campaign in early December.\n",
      "However, the nation is one of the hardest hit by the pandemic with more than 106,000 deaths.\n",
      "Johnson’s government has set itself the goal of administering 15 million doses of the jab to all individuals over 70 years of age and caregivers by mid-February.\n",
      "“The only way that we’re really going to see our country come out of this pandemic and the world come out of this pandemic is vaccination,” Fazackerley said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

Sumunod kayo nang kusa sa mga alituntunin na pinatutupad ng national government at local government (continue taking care of yourselves. Voluntarily follow the guidelines issued by the national and local government) with regard to health protocols,” he added.\n",
      "Data from the city government showed that there are 362 active cases out of 26,458 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the capital city as of Sunday noon. Of this figure, 25,312 have recovered while 784 have died.The Manila city government has also sustained its free swab testing efforts for both residents and non-residents of the city. As of January 30, it has already tested 72,000 people.\n",
      "Meanwhile, around 1,875 people have been swabbed for the city government’s Balik Maynila Free Swab Testing program, that was launched for residents returning to the city after spending the holidays in the province or abroad. At least 20 have tested positive for COVID-19 as of January 29.The city government also recently upgraded its drive-thru serology testing facility at Quirino Grandstand to a swab testing facility, where 654 people have been tested with eight found positive also as of January 29.Domagoso earlier signed an agreement with British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for the advance purchase of 800,000 vaccines that is seen to benefit 400,000 people.\n",
      "Frontline health workers, senior citizens and other members of vulnerable sectors, uniformed personnel, and public school teachers are included in the city government’s priority list for the vaccine.\n",
      "Next to be inoculated will be those who pre-registered at the manilacovid19vaccine.com. As of Sunday evening, nearly 79,000 people have registered on the website.The Manila COVID-19 Vaccine Storage Facility was also recently opened at the 7th floor of Sta. Ana Hospital. It is equipped with several refrigeration units that can store different brands of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "These include five Haier HYC-390 refrigeration units which can store vaccine doses from AstraZeneca and Sinovac, four other biomedical freezers which can store Janssen and Moderna vaccine vials, and three -86 degrees celsius ULT Freezers from Haier which can store Pfizer vaccines.\n",
      "The city government also acquired 50 transport coolers that will be used to deploy the vaccines.\n",

      "The European Commission on Friday launched a scheme to monitor and in some cases bar exports of vaccines produced in EU plants, amid a row with British-Swedish drugs giant AstraZeneca.\n",

The European Union’s medicines regulator said on January 28, 2021 it was now recommending medics leave three weeks between doses of the Pfizer/BionTech coronavirus vaccine — rather than at least three weeks. (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS / AFP)\n",
      "The move was firmly criticised by the World Health Organization and risked stoking conflict with the UK just weeks after London and Brussels sealed a trade deal.“We paid these companies to increase production and now we expect them to deliver,” EU Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters.“Today’s measure has been adopted with the utmost urgency. The aim is to provide us immediately with full transparency…. And if needed, it also will provide us with a tool to ensure vaccine deliveries.”\n",
      "EU officials said they expected the order to come into effect on Saturday after its publication in the official journal.The emergency measure is initially for six weeks but is intended to then continue until at least the end of March.The WHO said the move was part of a “very worrying trend” that could jeopardise the global supply chain for vaccines.“It is not helpful to have any country at this stage putting export bans or export barriers that will not allow for the free movement of the necessary ingredients that will make vaccines, diagnostics and other medicines available to all the world,” said Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director for access to medicines and health product.\n",
      "The EU’s plan applies only to those coronavirus vaccines that are covered by advance purchase agreements between drug companies and the European Commission.Those firms in the EU will have to apply for an authorisation to export doses meant for countries outside the bloc, and show their export records for the previous three months.\n",
      "A response would normally be given within 48 hours, though that could be extended if necessary.\n",
      "Most non-EU countries in and around Europe, such as Switzerland, those in the Balkans or micro-states like Monaco, are exempted from the measure.But Britain, which last year left the EU amid much acrimony, is not.\n",
      "Brussels has been in a furious dispute with AstraZeneca this week, accusing it of breaching its contract by delaying deliveries to EU governments while maintaining those under a deal it signed earlier with the UK.\n",
      "But Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides insisted: “We are not protecting ourselves against any specific country. And we’re not in competition or in a race against any country.”The prior three-month reporting period would presumably reveal whether or not AstraZeneca did indeed — as has been alleged — send vaccines to Britain from its vaccine plants in Europe, which it says have since been hit by production glitches.\n",
      "Belgian authorities on Thursday searched one AstraZeneca plant in southern Belgium at the European Commission’s request. Data seized is being analysed.\n",
      "– ‘A fair approach’ –\n",
      "EU officials insisted that the scheme is not targeting AstraZeneca alone, but all Covid vaccine-exporting firms tied to the Commission by contracts.\n",
      "The main goal, they said, was to gather information, though they admitted that in “certain circumstances” vaccine exports could be denied.\n",
      "“What we want to achieve is of course, a fair approach. And transparency will help us in that respect,” said one official on condition of anonymity.\n",
      "Vaccines, he said, are “a very strategic product, at a very delicate time”.The officials noted that the EU’s vaccine procurement portfolio is for 2.5 billion doses of authorised and potential vaccines — more than enough for the bloc’s 450 million inhabitants.\n",
      "That is because the Commission also bought on behalf of poorer countries, with its excess doses to be funnelled through the WHO-led COVAX facility.\n",
      "“We’re not talking about vaccine nationalism,” one official said. “From the beginning we intended to share these vaccines with our neighbours.”\n",
      "Right now, though, the EU’s vaccination programme is flagging badly, triggering anger among member states.\n",
      "On Britain not being exempted from the export-authorisation scheme, one EU official said: “The United Kingdom does not belong to either the COVAX countries nor to the EFTA (EU-linked European Free Trade Association) countries, nor to the neighbourhood.”\n",
      "Speaking at a virtual news conference later Friday, AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said the firm was working “24/7 to improve the supply we have”.\n",
      "“We have a very very broad supply chain around the world. We are already producing an enormous amount of vaccine over a month\n",
      "“Our plan is to source some of this material and bring it to Europe. The first shipment will be about three million doses that are going to leave in the next few days,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Hungary on Friday became the first EU member to approve the Chinese-made Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine, a week after it also broke ranks with Brussels by issuing a provisional permit for Russia’s Sputnik V jab.\n",
      "“Today the National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition (OGYEI) gave its approval for the Sinopharm vaccine,” Chief Medical Officer Cecilia Muller told a briefing.\n",
      "A few hours later Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced on his Facebook page that Hungary had agreed to buy “five million doses” of the vaccine, “enough to vaccinate two and a half million people” out of Hungary’s population of 9.8 million.“Delivery will be carried out in four stages, in four months,” he said.\n",
      "Earlier on Friday Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that he would choose the vaccine for his own inoculation.\n",
      "“The Chinese have known this virus for the longest time, hence probably they know most about it, so I will wait for my turn, and when I choose I will want the Chinese vaccine,” Orban said.\n",
      "Budapest expects to order 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm jab for delivery in February, Orban’s chief-of-staff said Thursday.\n",
      "Last week Hungary became the first EU member to approve Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, and said it had agreed to buy two million doses of the jab.\n",
      "A decree published Thursday and in effect from Friday allows the foreign minister to license any vaccine that has already been administered to more than one million people, without requiring the Hungarian pharmaceutical authority to sign it off.\n",
      "The Hungarian government says the decree was needed to speed up the approval process. It also provides for approval if a vaccine has been used in three other countries, including at least one EU or EU-candidate country.Orban said Hungary was monitoring how mass inoculation with a Chinese vaccine is proceeding in neighbouring Serbia, an EU candidate country that is home to a sizeable community of ethnic Hungarians.\n",
      "Earlier this month, Serbia became the first European country to start a mass vaccination programme with one million doses delivered by Sinopharm.\n",
      "The Hungarian Chamber of Doctors struck a cautious note in reaction to Friday’s news, urging OGYEI to license “products only in transparent compliance with the rules of pharmaceutical safety, after examination in accordance with the rules of the European Medicines Agency”.\n",
      "The group said a careful approach was essential “so that our medical colleagues can recommend and administer (vaccines) in good conscience”.\n",
      "Orban has long courted both Moscow and Beijing as part of what he calls a “pragmatic” foreign policy, and regularly is at loggerheads with Brussels, particularly over migration policy.Criticising the slow pace of delivery of jabs from the EU’s joint procurement programme, Orban said that his government must “stand on two legs” and is looking beyond the EU for vaccine supplies in the US and Israel, as well as Russia and China.\n",
      "Hungarians’ willingness to get inoculated is one of the lowest rates in the EU but has been rising in recent months.\n",
      "In a survey published by opinion research firm Publicus on Friday, six out of 10 Hungarians said they would want to get vaccinated, up from four out of 10 in November.\n",
      "The most popular choices were the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, with the Russian and Chinese jabs least popular. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine generated strong protection against Covid-19 in a large, late-stage trial, raising hopes that it can rapidly reshape a stumbling immunization campaign.\n",
      "(photo from AFP)\n",
      "In the more than 44,000-person study, the vaccine prevented 66% of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19, according to a company statement on Friday. And it was particularly effective at stopping severe disease, preventing 85% of severe infections and 100% of hospitalizations and deaths.\n",
      "“If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress and human suffering” of the pandemic, said Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease official, at a briefing on the results with company and government officials.Based on the result, J&J plans to file for an emergency-use authorization in the US next week. The drug giant’s top scientist said this month that he expects a clearance in March, and that it would have product ready to ship then. The company didn’t specify how much of the vaccine would be available immediately, though it reaffirmed that the US would receive 100 million doses in the first half of the year.\n",
      "Shares of J&J declined 4% to $162.52 in premarket trading on Friday.\n",
      "If cleared, J&J’s vaccine could go a long way toward ending the pandemic. Competing vaccines from Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. have generated stronger overall efficacy rates, but require two shots to be given before their full benefits take hold. J&J’s shot also can be kept in a refrigerator for three months, while those from Pfizer and Moderna must be kept frozen.\n",
      "“This is a single shot that can be given easily, it protects completely from that which we fear, having to go to the emergency room or a hospital,” said Mathai Mammen, head of global research and development for J&J’s pharmaceutical division, in an interview. “It’s going to change the nature of the disease.”Concerns about keeping second doses of the current shots on hand have complicated the push to get as many people as possible inoculated. Some countries have chosen to spread out the time between doses to address the problem, at the risk of diminishing their effectiveness.\n",
      "The rise of new coronavirus variants has added to the pressure to get immunizations moving faster. The J&J trial was conducted around the globe, including at dozens of clinical-trial sites in hot spots such as South Africa and Brazil where new variants have caused infections to rise.\n",
      "J&J’s results produced more evidence that the variants will be harder to ward off. In the US, where mutations aren’t thought to be as widespread, the vaccine was 72% effective. But in South Africa, where a variant called B.1.351 is circulating widely, it was only 57% effective. And the shot was 66% effective in Latin America.\n",
      "Nonetheless, J&J’s vaccine is likely to give countries around the world a powerful new tool to fight a virus that has infected more than 101 million people and killed 2.2 million worldwide.\n",
      "If confirmed, the results suggest people could get one dose of the vaccine to provide initial protection against severe consequences, allowing them to return to their pre-pandemic lives. Then, if needed, they could later take a booster shot J&J is testing in other large, late-stage trials that could produce results before year-end.\n",
      "J&J said a review by a monitoring board identified no significant safety concerns. While 9% of people who took the shot developed a fever, there were no severe allergic reactions.\n",
      "Different Technology\n",
      "J&J’s vaccine is different from the messenger RNA-based shots made by Moderna and partners Pfizer and BioNTech SE, which each were shown to be more than 90% effective.It is based on an adenovirus, or cold germ modified to make copies of the coronavirus spike protein, which the pathogen uses to force its way into cells. The altered virus can’t replicate in humans, but it triggers an immune response that prepares the body to defend itself against the coronavirus. J&J uses the same technology in a vaccine to fight Ebola.\n",
      "J&J’s R&D head said the company’s trial, conducted at the height of the pandemic, had to deal with resistant variants that arose mainly after Moderna’s and Pfizer’s trials were completed. When counting cases, it also focused on somewhat sicker patients than other trials, Mammen said.\n",
      "“If those vaccine programs accrued cases at the same time as us, when viral infections were so much higher, incidents were higher, and variants were all around us, they would have gotten different numbers,” he said. “The fact that we could do this level of efficacy with a single shot, people don’t have to come back for another, and it’s conveniently stored, well that makes this the vaccine of choice.”\n",
      "At the outset of the pandemic, US government officials said any vaccine showing greater than 50% efficacy would be considered a success.\n",
      "Like Pfizer and Moderna, Mammen said J&J is working on next-generation versions of the shot that could provide protection specifically against certain variants. Other vaccines have seen mixed results against the newer forms of the virus.\n",
      "On Thursday, Novavax Inc. reported that a large late-stage study in the U.K. found its Covid vaccine was 89% effective. However, it was just 60% effective in South Africa in people who were HIV negative, and 49.4% effective when HIV positive patients were included. Most cases of the virus seen in the trial had the new South Africa mutation, the company said.\n",
      "J&J “is already testing and creating vaccines with the ability to respond quickly to the South African strain,” Mammen said.\n",
      "Gaining Clearance\n",
      "J&J aims to have a total of seven manufacturing facilities running by the end of the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said Jan. 26. The company says it remains on track to hit the goal of producing 1 billion doses globally before year-end, even as production has been slow to scale up throughout the winter.\n",
      "J&J’s candidate was among six vaccines tapped for the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed program, receiving some $1.5 billion in backing from the US government. The company intends to price the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis, defined by a Gates Foundation model and determined in conjunction with independent auditors, according to Wolk. The price per shot will not exceed $10, he said.\n",
      "While the trial readout marks the start of a new phase in the pandemic response, it also is the close of an anxious chapter in the lives of those who developed it. Mammen said he was in his basement office in his home in New Hope, Pennslvania, when he learned the results.\n",
      "“I’ve been at this for about a year, every day, morning through night,” he said. “When it was unblinded, there was this massive, I mean massive, sense of relief. And great joy. I could finally sleep.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "(OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III had said some 57 to 60 million Filipinos are expected to receive vaccines secured by the government within the year.This is in addition to the approximately 10 million to 13 million that will be vaccinated by the local government units (LGUs) and the private sector.“Mahalaga na makakaabot ang mga bakunang ito sa mga pinaka-nangangailangan na dapat makatanggap. May mga taong hindi alam kung saan pupunta at ni hindi alam kung ano ang ibig sabihin ng vaccine… Sila ang kailangan lumabas at magtrabaho upang buhayin ang pamilya nila. Sila ang mga isang kahig, isang tuka,’’ Go said. (It is important that the vaccines reach those who really are in need to have it. There are people who do not where to go and do not even understand what a vaccine is…They are the ones that need to go out and work to support their families. They are those who endure a “hand-to-mouth” existence),” said Go.The senator from Davao stressed that government must meet its target within the agreed time frame while addressing the logistical challenges facing the rollout, particularly in medically underserved areas that have fewer healthcare facilities and workers.\n",
      "As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Go said that the poor and vulnerable sectors be given priority access to vaccines.This, explained Go, would allow the government to reopen the economy and help address the issue of hunger in impoverished communities.“Pag magbubukas na tayo, makakabalik na po ang mga kababayan natin unti-unti sa kanilang mga trabaho. Kaya nga po sa ngayon, ‘yon ang inuunang tutukan ng ating mga finance managers, ‘yung hunger (rate) — from thirty-one [percent], I think, bumaba sa sixteen [percent]. Dapat pa po itong bumaba at dapat po walang magugutom na Pilipino,’’ he said.(Once we open {the economy], our countrymen can slowly go back to their works. That is why for now, our finance managers are focused on hunger (rate) — from 31 [percent], I think, it went down to 16 percent]. This should go down further and no Filipino should go hungry.)“Kaya binabalanse ng ating mahal na Pangulo [Rodrigo Duterte] ang lahat. Lalung-lalo na po ‘yung mga talagang apektado at ‘yung mga nawalan ng trabaho. Iyon po ang inuuna ng ating gobyerno. Ina-address ngayon kung ano pong puwedeng maitulong, he added. (This is why our beloved President [Rodrigo Duterte] is balancing everything. Especially those that are really affected and those who lost their jobs. That is the priority of the government. It is now addressing whatever it can help.)Go emphasized that the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines are necessary in building the trust and confidence of the Filipino people as many of them are still reluctant to get vaccinated.He said that the Philippines could learn from the experiences of other countries which have already started their rollout, particularly in anticipating any adverse effects of the vaccines.Go also welcomed the efforts to expedite the solidarity vaccine trial in the Philippines as he commended President Duterte for his decision to approve the funds for the World Health Organization solidarity trial for COVID-19 in the country.In another development, Go assured the public that President Duterte would not be pressured by any country providing COVID-19 vaccines, allaying fears that China could put pressure on the Philippines to support their own interests in exchange for the vaccines.“Ang isyu ngayon dito ay bakuna.

      "Biden is seeking to turn around the fight against the virus, which took a ferocious grip on the country during Donald Trump’s presidency when the risks were downplayed and officials gave mixed messages on mask wearing other safety measures.Biden said vaccinating the entire US population was a daunting challenge, and the program inherited from the Trump administration “was in worse shape than we anticipated or expected.”“This is a war-time undertaking. It’s not hyperbole,” he said, announcing the US was buying an additional 200 million doses and will have enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans — virtually the entire population — by early fall.In another day of grim milestones, Britain surged past 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, and other European nations looked to tighten their borders, hoping to keep out new, more transmissible virus strains.\n",
      "Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was “hard to compute” the loss felt by British families after his country became the first European country to surpass 100,000 COVID-19 deaths.But he said his government, which faced criticism over its initial response to the outbreak, “did everything that we could to minimize suffering and minimize loss of life.”‘Drastic measures’The London Times said the UK government will announce Wednesday that British travelers must quarantine in hotels near airports for 10 days after returning from 30 high-risk countries, mostly in South America and Southern Africa.\n",

      "Iceland, meanwhile, started to issue vaccination certificates to ease travel for those who have had both required doses.The new measures came as anger rises over grinding anti-coronavirus restrictions, with the Netherlands rocked by nightly riots since it imposed a curfew on Saturday.\n",
      "More than 400 people were arrested after the worst unrest to hit the country in four decades, but the Dutch government said it would not back down.“You don’t capitulate to people who smash shop windows,” Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said, calling the rioters “scum.”Israeli police also clashed with protesters, arresting 14 people after ultra-Orthodox Jews demonstrated against lockdown measures.\n",
      "With the global death toll at 2.1 million, the world has looked to vaccines to break the gloom, but bickering over access to doses has intensified.Tensions have in particular mounted between the European Union and pharmaceutical firms over delays to deliveries.“Europe invested billions to help develop the world’s first COVID-19 vaccines,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen told the virtual World Economic Forum (WEF).“And now, the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations.”Israel leads the vaccine race\n",
      "Europe’s vaccination campaign stumbled after British-Swedish drugs company AstraZeneca warned it would not be able to meet promised targets on EU shipments – a week after US group Pfizer said it was also delaying delivery volumes.AstraZeneca’s CEO insisted Tuesday that the company was not selling vaccines ordered by the EU to other countries at a profit.None of the world’s 29 poorest countries has formally started mass COVID-19 vaccination drives, while the richest nations have given more than two thirds of the 69 million jabs administered so far.The favored ones include 49 countries mainly in North America, Europe and the Gulf which have already launched their mass vaccination drives.Of the poor countries Guinea is acting as a pioneer, having vaccinated a couple of dozen as a trial.Middle income countries are not faring well either, with only the richest among them – including China, Russia, Turkey and Brazil – getting 28 percent of the total jabs on offer.Israel is by far leading the way in the vaccine race, with 31 percent of its population having received at least one dose.The United Kingdom has given jabs to around 10 percent of its population and the United States, the world’s worst-stricken country to nearly six percent of its people.The world’s richest countries and the more well off middle income countries have 97 percent of the doses in their hands.The remaining three percent have been given in India, which has injected more than two million doses.On Sunday Egypt became the second country in the lower tier of the middle income countries to launch its vaccination campaign.The WHO and its official vaccine coalition Gavi have set up a mechanism to distribute vaccines to poorer countries, but not a single dose has yet been administered.The program is lacking the billions of dollars needed to achieve the goal of providing doses to 20 percent of the population of target countries by the end of the year.

      "Brazil recently approved CoronaVac, the vaccine made by Beijing-based company Sinovac, thereby enabling Latin America’s largest nation to begin their immunization program. CoronaVac has demonstrated 100% protection against severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in the recently-concluded clinical trial involving 12,476 healthcare workers in Brazil. This trial is currently the only publicly disclosed phase 3 clinical trial (involving COVID-19 vaccines), where participants were all healthcare workers working in hospitals. Accordingly, it provides an actual indication of the capability of this vaccine to protect the critical healthcare workforce. Several days after Brazil’s announcement, Chile announced the emergency use approval of CoronaVac as well. Sinovac has agreements in place with at least eight countries, including Turkey, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Chile, and Brazil.\n",
      "CoronaVac was recently granted approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines (FDA) and the Department of Health’s Single Joint Research Ethics Board (SJREB) to conduct clinical trials in the Philippines. Sponsored and financed by IP Biotech, Inc. which combined the latest in technological and medical advances,the study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted on volunteers aged 60 to 80 years, “The trial, which is representative of our local circumstances and in a target age group, will provide supplemental data to the global trials,” saidDr. Noel Miranda, a member of the scientific team of IP Biotech, Inc., a Filipino biotech/vaccine provider. “Given the FDA approval and the unbiased framework of the study, I am optimistic that CoronaVac’s worthiness for massive vaccination will further be validated. It is our hope that the Filipinos, especially our elderly population, would all benefit from the protection that this promising vaccine offers.”\n",
      "Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency began rolling out CoronaVac on Monday, and has announced plans to vaccinate priority groups starting with health workers, people above 60 years of age, disabled people, and the indigenous population. The country now has six million doses of Sinovac’sCoronaVac on hand.Previously, the 50.4% overall efficacy reported from Brazil’s Phase 3 trials drew public attention. Investigators, however, soon pointed out that the results came from all cases, including “very mild” cases that did not require medical intervention. It was further revealed that the study participants were all healthcare workers constantly exposed to COVID-19 transmissions in the hospital setting, at attack rates close to five times the average.\n",
      "“Vaccine efficacy must be thoroughly evaluated in relation to the methodology. In the case of the Brazil trial, their analysis included very mild COVID-19 cases occurring in high transmission-risk settings,” noted Dr. Noel Miranda, a member of the scientific team of IP Biotech, Inc., a Filipino biotech/vaccine provider.\n",
      "“The overall protection rate of 50.4%, given the circumstances, is indeed acceptable and provides a sense of assurance in light of the 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization obtained in Brazil and Turkey,” he added. “Given the current understanding that none of the EUA-approved vaccines are capable of preventing asymptomatic and mild infections, the true merit of being vaccinated lies in reducing disease severity and mortality, where the disease would just manifest as a common cold with mild symptoms.By aiming for this, we can also help alleviate fear.” he further explained.

      "“We have to clarify that because it is a crime to engage in medical procedures if you are not a trained personnel,” she said.“This is NOT allowed, the DOH has never said that and we never said that as well,” she explained.Instead of participating in the actual medical procedure, Briones said that the teachers will play a bigger role when it comes to information dissemination.“The biggest contribution of teachers is to disseminate information on vaccines,” she said.\n",
      "“Even for that, they have to be briefed also so they would fully understand the benefits and the protection offered by the vaccine on teachers,” she added.Teachers, Briones stressed, will be more involved in the “education aspect” of the vaccination and not in participating in the medical procedures.\n",

      "US biotechnology firm Moderna on Monday said lab studies showed its Covid-19 vaccine remains effective against variants of the coronavirus first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa.\n",
      "To study the impact of the Moderna vaccine, called mRNA-1273, the company took blood samples from eight people who had received two doses of the vaccine, and from primates that had also been immunized\n",
      "But the positive news was tempered by the finding that there was a sixfold reduction in the level of highly-potent neutralizing antibodies produced against the South African variant, B.1.351.\n",
      "Out of caution, the company will test adding a second booster of its vaccine — to make three shots in total — and has begun preclinical studies on a booster specifically for the South African variant.“We are encouraged by these new data, which reinforce our confidence that the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should be protective against these newly detected variants,” said Stephane Bancel, Moderna’s CEO.\n",
      "“Out of an abundance of caution and leveraging the flexibility of our mRNA platform, we are advancing an emerging variant booster candidate against the variant first identified in the Republic of South Africa into the clinic.”\n",
      "The emergence of highly contagious variants to the SARS-CoV-2 virus had triggered concern about their impact on the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines even as countries begin to accelerate their immunization programs.\n",
      "Both the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in the UK and the B.1.351 variant have multiple mutations along the “spike protein,” molecules that dot the surface of the virus and allow it to invade human cells.\n",
      "Scientists have been particularly worried that the mutations on B.1.351 would lead to the virus escaping the action of antibodies, and render the current generation of vaccines obsolete.Moderna’s vaccine uses mRNA — a type of genetic molecule — to deliver the information for human cells to create the spike protein inside the human body, in order to trigger an immune response.\n",
      "A booster for B.1.351 would therefore carry the mRNA that creates the spike protein with the mutations that are specific to the variant.\n",
      "A major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed in a matter of weeks, even though producing them to mass scale may take much longer.\n",
      "– Reaction mixed –To study the impact of the Moderna vaccine, called mRNA-1273, the company took blood samples from eight people who had received two doses of the vaccine, and from primates that had also been immunized.\n",
      "For the B.1.1.7 variant there was no impact on the level of neutralizing antibodies — which bind to the spike protein and prevent it from invading human cells — that were produced by the shots.\n",
      "But for the South African variant, B.1.351, there was a sixfold reduction in the neutralizing antibody level.\n",
      "Even so, the company said it remained above the quantity that was shown to be protective in earlier tests on primates that were infected on purpose.Reaction to Moderna’s statement by independent experts was mixed.\n",
      "Akiko Iwasaki, a leading virologist from Yale, tweeted: “This is good,” adding that she expected other vaccine makers were also developing boosters that target the South African variant.\n",
      "Benjamin Neuman, a virologist from Texas A&M university, agreed and told AFP that the reduction in potency pertained to only one type of antibody, that make up one percent of the overall antibodies that bind to the spike protein of the virus, which it uses to enter cells.\n",
      "“To be clear, the 99 percent of antibodies that bind to other parts of the spike and are not neutralizing should still work just as well on the mutant strains,” he said.\n",
      "He added the decrease found in the study “would be more a bellwether of potential problems to come than a sign of imminent danger,” adding that in a living person, the immune system learns to adjust the antibodies it produces if their efficiency decreases.\n",
      "But Lawrence Young, a virologist at Britain’s Warwick University, said the sixfold reduction was a matter “of concern” and suggested vaccine efficacy as well as duration of protection could be impacted.\n",

      "What should you consider when getting a vaccine?\n",
      "Dr. Edsel Maurice T. SalvanaIf you told people that there was a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 last year at the start of the pandemic, many would have rushed to get it and they would not have cared who made the vaccine or where it came from. Now that there are several safe and effective vaccines with emergency authorization, there is some confusion on which vaccine is the best, and which one to pick. Should you wait for the best vaccine, or take the first one that is available? The answers to these questions can get very technical and can go beyond just looking at the touted vaccine efficacy numbers in mainstream media.\n",
      "Safety\n",
      "MODERNA\n",
      "The two most important traits of any COVID-19 vaccine are its safety and efficacy. Safety is established through an increasing number of patients from Phase 1 to Phase 3 clinical trials. If a vaccine is found to be unsafe in the early studies, it will never get to Phase 3 because no one will use a vaccine that carries substantial risk. The key term here is reasonably safe, as most vaccines will give you a sore arm and some may cause fever. Any deaths during the trials are thoroughly investigated to see if it may be somehow linked to the vaccine. If an experimental vaccine is linked to a significant number of deaths, clinical trials are unlikely to progress further.Phase 3 trials typically involve thousands to tens of thousands of participants. The number of people recruited depends on the effect that is being looked at. The degree of safety for these kinds of trials makes it unlikely that any severe reaction that occurs more than once out of 1,000 vaccine doses will be missed.\n",
      "SINOVAC\n",
      "The length of follow-up for safety vaccine recipients is usually set at one to two years before a vaccine is approved for market. With the current pandemic, however, too many people will die if we wait that long before we deploy a potentially effective vaccine. Two million people have already died of COVID-19 in just one year. To address the pandemic emergency, many of the country regulatory authorities have turned to the emergency use authorization designation (EUA).\n",

      "An EUA allows vaccines for limited use as long as they have demonstrated a minimum clinical efficacy of at least 50 percent and a minimum length of safety follow-up over at least two months. The minimum level of efficacy is set at 50 percent because patient populations that are at higher risk for dying will already substantially benefit from such a vaccine. This benefit is greater than the potentially rare adverse events that may be found later on. For people outside the high-risk groups, the benefit over the risk may still be favorable, but it may also be reasonable to wait for longer safety follow-up or a better vaccine without as high a risk of a bad outcome.\n",
      "EfficacyWhen clinical trials are designed to see how well a vaccine works, the most important value that is measured is the primary outcome. This is the outcome that is measured to determine whether a vaccine works or not, and how well the vaccine works. There are many ways of looking at vaccine efficacy, depending on the primary outcome. The easiest way to measure vaccine efficacy is to see how often someone who gets the vaccine develops clinical disease compared with someone who got a placebo or an inactive ingredient.\n",
      "Clinical disease means that someone is infected and manifests symptoms of disease. When all infections result in symptoms, vaccine clinical efficacy usually correlates well with the ability of the vaccine to prevent infection. When there are a significant number of asymptomatic infections like in COVID-19, it becomes more difficult to measure a vaccine’s ability to prevent all infection. Since even asymptomatic COVID-19 patients can infect others, the clinical efficacy of any COVID-19 vaccine will not translate into its ability to prevent infection.\n",
      "Clinical trials for the current Phase 3 vaccines that have been approved for COVID-19 have focused on clinical efficacy to expedite the rollout of an effective vaccine. After someone gets the vaccine or a placebo, the clinical trials investigators instruct the patients to seek care if they develop any COVID-19 symptoms. Only then will they test them to see if they truly have COVID-19. A comparison is made between the number of patients who get COVID-19 in the vaccine group versus the number of patients who get COVID-19 in the placebo group. The vaccine clinical efficacy is derived from this. The vaccine clinical efficacy for preventing any symptomatic clinical disease for the Pfizer vaccine is 95 percent, while for Moderna it is 94 percent. It is 62 percent for the Astra vaccine and 50.4 percent for Sinovac. None of these values reflect the ability to prevent transmission, only the ability to prevent clinical disease.Beyond prevention of clinical disease, it is also important to think about how well a vaccine prevents severe disease. While Pfizer was able to prevent 95 percent of clinical disease among its vaccinees, it was only able to prevent 89 percent of severe disease compared to placebo. Astra, Moderna, and Sinovac had no cases of severe disease in their vaccinated groups compared to placebo, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 100 percent for preventing severe disease. No one expects any of these vaccines to perform as well as this in real practice, but if properly used, the vaccine effectiveness on rollout against severe disease will be quite high and will save many, many lives. This is especially true among the most vulnerable groups such as the elderly and frontline healthcare workers among whom up to 10 percent of those infected can die.\n",
      "Finally, herd immunity is currently not guaranteed for any of the COVID-19 vaccines. To prove transmission interruption, even asymptomatic people will have to be swabbed periodically and asymptomatic infection rates compared between those who were vaccinated versus placebo. This is much harder to demonstrate and will take a longer time. Moderna is doing some of these studies and early data shows that it may block up to 2/3 of transmission of COVID-19. This is less certain for the other vaccines.\n",
      "To get or not to get vaccinated\n",
      "There are over 200 vaccines in development and at least 10 have gotten some form of EUA or an equivalent designation. In the Philippines, only the Pfizer vaccine has gotten an EUA. An absolute requirement for the EUA in the Philippines is complete Phase 3 clinical data with a minimum length of safety follow-up. Among the vaccines that have this data are Pfizer, Moderna, Astra, and Sinovac. Pfizer and Moderna have published their results in peer-reviewed journals. Astra has published interim results but it has not published its final clinical trial results. Sinovac recently released partial data from its completed clinical trial in Brazil in a press conference, but the publicly available details remain sparse.\n",
      "The two vaccines that will most likely get here by the end of February are the Pfizer vaccine and Sinovac. The Pfizer vaccine is via the WHO Covax facility and Sinovac has committed 50,000 doses for the end of February. Only Pfizer, however, currently has an EUA and it is not certain whether Sinovac will get an EUA by then.\n",
      "Unless you are a frontliner, it is unlikely that you will be offered the vaccine as part of the government program in February. If there is enough supply to cover all frontliners nationwide, the next priority group will be seniors. If you belong to either of these groups, you should take whatever vaccine is offered unless you have a specific contraindication. This is because Pfizer is 95 percent clinically effective and reduces the risk of severe COVID-19 by 89 percent.\n",
      "If only Sinovac is available, it may still be worthwhile because even though it is only 50.4 percent clinically effective against mild disease, it completely protected against severe disease in the clinical trial population. Remember that high risk groups have a 10 percent chance of dying and so holding out for a better vaccine may be too late.\n",
      "More vaccines, including Astra and Moderna, may arrive in the second and third quarter of 2021. Both Astra and Moderna completely protected against severe disease in its clinical trials, and clinical efficacy was 62 percent and 94 percent respectively. People who will be eligible for this will include the remaining frontliners and seniors, people with comorbid conditions and essential workers. More shipments of Pfizer and Sinovac may arrive and more vaccines may already be granted EUAs by then. There may also be more data regarding transmission-blocking effects and also which vaccines work best against the new variants.\n",
      "If you do not belong to the high-risk priority groups, don’t feel bad. The more time there is to observe the effects of the vaccines in a bigger population, the safer it will be for you. You may also have a wider array of vaccines to choose from, and some of them may be safer and more efficacious with a longer duration of protection. In the meantime, it is important to stick to the minimum health standards to decrease the risk of infection and of passing on the disease to other people.\n",
      "In the end, the kind of vaccine that may be best for you comes down to clinical efficacy, availability, the ability to prevent severe disease, and the risk group you belong to. If you are in a high-risk group, getting the first available vaccine that can protect you from severe disease and dying is paramount. If you are not in the severe risk group, waiting for better vaccines isn’t a bad thing. Either way, the end of the pandemic is in sight so let’s ensure as many of us get there alive and healthy.

      "President Duterte has vowed to personally look into the prices of the coronavirus vaccines secured by the government to determine if they are “reasonable.”\n",
      "President Rodrigo Roa Duterte (RICHARD MADELO/ PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO)\n",
      "Addressing the nation Monday night, the President said he intends to “take a look and ask around” about the cost of the vaccines, telling the nation that the government’s supply arrangements made by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. will still undergo a review.\n",
      "“That’s not the end of the everything. The decision of Galvez is not, I said, the sum total of it all. It has to be reviewed,” Duterte said during his remarks aired on state television.“And finally sa akin rin, I will take a look and ask around if it is really a reasonable pricing for us,” he added.\n",
      "The price of the COVID-19 vaccines purchased by the government is among the contentious issues tackled in a recent Senate inquiry. Some lawmakers have pressed on officials to reveal the price for the sake of transparency but Galvez declined to do so owing to the confidentiality deal with the manufacturers. The Palace earlier dispelled concerns about the alleged high cost of the vaccine, saying a dose developed by China’s Sinovac only costs more or less P600.\n",
      "In the same address, the President brushed aside claims that some people supposedly managed to thwart an attempt on overpricing or corruption in the government’s vaccine purchase. Those making such claim were only muddling the issue, according to Duterte.“May statement that they were able to prevent corruption or overprice because of their vigilance. No. Far from it actually. You’re just muddling up, ginugulo lang ninyo (You’re just muddling the issue),” he said.He maintained that the government’s supply arrangements with vaccine makers must still go through scrutiny of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez. It is unlikely that any irregularity will slip past the finance chief, he added.\n",
      "“Dadaan pa ‘yan kay Dominguez and you know how Dominguez is.Tingnan mo kung makalusot yan kay Dominguez (It will still go through with Dominguez and you know how Dominguez is. Let’s see if that will pass through Dominguez),” he added.\n",
      "In the early part of his speech, the President said he wanted to talk to the people alleging corruption in the government’s vaccination program.\n",
      "Duterte remained skeptical about such allegations, insisting that no actual money will change hands in the procurement.“Walang pera. Laway pa lang ito lata. Conversation, istorya. may nagsabi na corruption or they were able to obstruct or prevent corruption because of their timely… (There is no actual money. It’s all talk for now, conversation, story. Some said there were able to obstruct or prevent corruption because of their timely intervention),” he said.\n",
      "“Mag-usap tayo. Tayo lang kung sino nagsabi niyan please rise and be brave enough to say you’re the one. I’d like to talk to you. Tayong dalawa lang (Let’s talk. Whoever said that please rte and brave enough to say you’re the one. I’d like to talk to you. Just the two of us),” he said.\n",
      "The government earlier set aside P82.5 billion for the purchase of coronavirus vaccines for Filipinos. It has sought financial aid from multilateral partners like World Bank and Asian Development Bank to help secure the country’s vaccine supplies.\n",
      "The government has so far secured millions of doses of vaccines from suppliers like Novavax, Sinovac, Moderna and AstraZeneca.The first batch of the supplies is expected to be delivered in the country next month. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“The standard document that our people will carry as their badge of protection that they have been vaccinated should not make them spend extra money because every peso is precious especially during these hard times,” she added.Poe recently filed Senate Bill No. 1994 or her proposed “Vaccine Passport Act” which provides for the issuance of vaccine passport, or the certificate that an individual has received doses of the coronavirus vaccines and completed the course of COVID-19 immunization.\n",
      "Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said this in already included in the government’s national vaccination plans.\n",
      "Under Poe’s bill, the certificate would contain some basic personal information about the vaccinee, the type and purpose of the vaccines administered to the holder, the date of the vaccination, and the persons and institutions that administered the vaccine and other information deemed necessary by concerned authorities.\n",
      "The measure also includes a provision that prohibits the collection of fees for the issuance, amendment or replacement of a vaccine passport; as well as penalties for offenses for possession of more than one vaccine passport, falsification and forgery.During the Senate Committee of the Whole’s hearing on Friday, Poe said the vaccine passports will be effective in documenting those who have already received doses of the coronavirus vaccines and also in reopening the country’s economy.\n",
      "“‘Pag naghanap ang ating mga kababayan, kabilang na ang mga OFW, ng trabaho at pinakita nila ‘yon, advantage na ‘yan sa kanila. Alam naman natin ‘yon ang kulang sa atin ngayon na kailangan talagang mas dumami ulit ang mga nagtatrabaho,” she said.\n",
      "(If our people, including overseas Filipinos, look for jobs and present the passport, that’s an advantage to them already. We all know our challenge with unemployment so we have to boost the number of those who have jobs.)She said the vaccine passport can also be used for other emerging or reemerging infectious diseases in the future.\n",
      "Poe said the DOH and relevant agencies must keep an organized record and database about the immunization program. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "There would be no strings attached to the much-awaited COVID-19 vaccines that would be donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines, a Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) official said Friday.\n",
      "“Allow me to convey our assurances that our transactions on the vaccine supply with our global partners, in the bilateral and multilateral levels, do not have strings attached nor is it bearing any quid pro quo for any sovereign territorial consideration,” DFA Assistant Secretary Eric Gerardo Tamayo said in response to Sen. Risa Hontiveros’ question if there are strings attached to the donation at the continuation of the Senate Committee of Whole hearing on the government’s COVID-19 vaccination program.\n",
      "Tamayo said the vaccines that China would be donating to the Philippines, is an expression of “goodwill.”“We can assure that in the particular case of the donation from China, at no time that China even hinted or tied the vaccine to any consideration,” the DFA official added.\n",
      "“Vaccine diplomacy, is at best, an expression of good will in solidarity with the Philippines especially during this time of the pandemic,” he said.\n",
      "Tamayo said that the COVAX facility, a platform that aims to ensure fast, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for people in all countries, is “some form of a donation mechanism” for all nations that are battling the pandemic.\n",
      "“It maybe noted that the COVAX facility itself is some form of a donation mechanism to lower and middle income countries,” he said.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. had earlier urged senators to set aside their differences on the West Philippine Sea in favor of the global interest “to save humanity.”\n",
      "“’Yung tinatawag nating differences on the West Philippine Sea should be set aside because this is a global pandemic,” Galvez said.\n",
      "But Hontiveros rejected Galvez’s statement and urged chief implementers of the national task force for COVID-19 not to compromise the country’s stake on the West Philippine Sea in exchange for the vaccines that China would be donating.\n",
      "“Just because we are buying Chinese vaccines or accepting their donation, we will be setting aside our rights and our territory in the West Philippine Sea,” Hontiveros said.The senator said it is imperative that the Philippine government protects its strategic interests while pursuing a solution to the pandemic.

      "Senator Panfilo M. Lacson (SENATE OF THE PHILIPPINES / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Lacson made the call during the third hearing of the Senate, convening as a Committee of the Whole, on the government’s vaccination program Friday.\n",
      "“This is critical because there are many associations abroad that may donate vaccines to their sister cities in the Philippines. Would it not be more practical to ensure the goods reach the intended recipients directly under strict supervision and guidance by health authorities, instead of coursing the goods through the Department of Health (DoH) and having the DoH distribute them,” he said.\n",
      "“Besides, many local government units (LGUs) like Baguio City already have their own cold storage facilities for the vaccines, as their local leaders had the foresight to act accordingly. Allowing such donated vaccines to go directly to the LGUs instead of having to go through the logistical requirements of the DoH and Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19 would also avoid the prospect of double handling and additional costs,” he added.\n",
      "Lacson pointed out the pandemic involves an emergency where authorities cannot afford to have vaccines go through the bureaucratic processes. “Ang purpose ng tanong ko, baka may paraan tayong ayusin natin ang sa halip na iikot pa, idiretso na (The point of my question is that we should find ways to simplify instead of complicate things),” he said.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. thanked Lacson for the recommendation, adding they “saw some of the gaps” in the procedures.\n",
      " Galvez said they are open to the idea, particularly of allowing the vaccines to be brought directly to the LGUs to avoid double handling.“Tama kayo, Sir. ‘Yan din ang gagawin namin. Kaya magkakaroon ng time and motion rehearsal para in case capable ang LGU, puwede idiretso para wala nang double handling (You are right, Sir. That is what we will do. We will have a time and motion rehearsal so we can allow donated vaccines to go directly to the LGUs so we don’t have to have double handling),” Galvez told Lacson. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "At the third hearing of the Senate Committee of the Whole on the government’s vaccination program, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez said the Philippines should set aside its differences with China on the West Philippine Sea as the country joins the global community in the race to put a stop to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

There are a lot of quarrels and suspicions even before we could sign a supply agreement.)Go appealed to the Executive and Legislative branches of the government for greater unity so the country can immediately procure its needed supply and start the rollout of the vaccination program.\n",

      "The country is set to receive COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility within the first quarter of this year, government officials said on Wednesday night.This was announced by Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III and Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. in a joint statement.“The Philippines today received the country’s confirmation of participation in the COVID-19 vaccine financing instrument, COVAX Facility—Advance Market Commitment (AMC),” the statement read.\n",
      "“With the country’s participation in the COVAX Facility, the country is set to receive vaccines in the first quarter of this year,” it added.The announcement, however, did not specify what vaccine brand and how many doses the Philippines will be receiving.To note, COVAX Facility is “designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide,” according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",
      "As part of the preparations for the COVID-19 vaccine deployment, Duque and Galvez inspected three cold storage facilities that “can potentially be used in the first wave of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out.”The cold chain facilities they visited were the First Pioneer Distribution Center of UNILAB located in Biñan City, Laguna; the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City; and the Zuellig Pharma Corporation in Parañaque City.\n",
      "“Apart from cold chain facilities, the vaccine cluster is also in talks with third-party logistics providers to ensure efficiency of the entire supply chain management of COVID-19 vaccines, from the receipt of vaccines from the COVAX Facility to its deployment,” said Duque.“All of these preparations that we are undertaking are aimed at ensuring that the country is ready to receive, store, and mobilize the COVID-19 vaccines that will come from the COVAX Facility,” he added.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora announced on Wednesday (January 20) that city residents can choose which brand of COVID-19 vaccine they want to be inoculated once it becomes available.Zamora made the statement when asked about some government officials being criticized for saying Filipinos should just accept whatever COVID-19 vaccine becomes available in the country.\n",
      "He said San Juan residents can be choosy on their preferred vaccine as long as there are available brand choices.“Pwedeng maging choosy ‘pag may choice… Dito sa San Juan, dalawa ang source ng bakuna: ang locally-sourced and funded, pati yung galing sa national government, (We can be choosy as long as the choice is there. Here in San Juan, there will be two vaccine sources — the locally-sourced and the funded, which includes those provided by the national government.),” Zamora said.“All this is voluntary. No one is forcing anyone to be vaccinated. But what we have in San Juan are options: AstraZeneca and Pfizer. ‘Pag available na both (when both become available), then we have a luxury of choice,” he added.The mayor said the city government entered into an agreement with British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for the advance purchase of 100,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and planning to procure more from other companies.Zamora said the city government has still remaining funds from the initial P50 million they allocated and can still procure additional vaccines from any other pharmaceutical companies.“Yung 100,000 doses hindi namin inubos ang P50 million. Malaking pondo pa po natitira sa P50 million. It will allow us to procure a second time. Hindi necessarily AstraZeneca uli sapagkat ang posibilidad ng ibang bakuna na dumating ay andyan na. There will be an option for us (We did not spend all our P50 million budget for the 100,000 doses. We have a huge fund left from the P50 million. It might not be AstraZeneca anymore because more vaccines will be available),”Zamora added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "NTF chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. and IATF head, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, led the inspection of the Zuellig Pharma warehouse in Parañaque City; Unilab Pharma Campus warehouse in Binan City, Laguna; and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) warehouse in Muntinlupa City.\n",
      "Galvez could not give the exact amount on how much it will cost the national government to pay for the usage of the pharmaceutical companies’ cold storage warehouses.He, however, said that the amount will range from $2 to $2.5 per vaccine dose.\n",
      "“We will still discuss this with the pharmaceutical companies and the vaccine manufacturers because we’re still in the middle of the negotiations of the supply agreement. But more or less, for each vaccine there is a rough estimate of maybe $2 to $2.5 per dose. That’s our internet calculation,” Galvez said in a press breifing at the Zuellig warehouse in Paranaque City.\n",
      "According to Galvez, the Zuellig and RITM warehouses will likely be used for the storage of the candidate vaccines of American firms Pfizer and Moderna since they require ultra cold temperatures of -20 and -70 to -80 degrees Centigrade.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Unilab warehouse can store vaccines at 2 to 8 degrees Centigrade which are fit for the vaccines of AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson, Novavax, and Sinovac.Around 650 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines can be stored in warehouses with 2 to 8 degrees Centigrade specification; 40 million doses in -20 degrees Centigrade warehouses; and 6.5 million doses in -70 to -80 degrees Centigrade depot, according to Duque.\n",
      "Duque also expressed confidence that there will be an adequate storage facility that can be used by the government once the vaccines arrive in the country.\n",
      "Vaccine arrivalsThe earliest date of arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the country will be in February.Galvez said around 50,000 doses of China’s Sinovac will arrive on February 20, and an unspecified number of Pfizer vaccines are also scheduled to be delivered “sometime” in the same month.\n",
      "Meanwhile, he noted that China will donate around 500,000 doses of Sinovac once its emergency use for application (EUA) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n",

      "“We will not declare yet because the negotiations are still ongoing. Two countries and two products,” he revealed.Transport\n",
      "Further, Galvez said he has already negotiated with the vaccine manufacturers as to the transportation of the vaccines to the different vaccination centers.\n",

      "Recto filed on Wednesday the proposed Senate Resolution No. 617 which echoes his colleagues’ appeal for the streamlining of the procurement of coronavirus vaccines.\n",
      "Currently, LGUs and private companies may only purchase vaccines through a tripartite agreement with the national government and pharmaceutical firms.Recto, however, said letting the LGUs and private sector buy their own vaccines is a “regulatory matter” that could be allowed temporarily during a pandemic or a state of national health emergency.\n",
      "This way, the national government “can focus its vaccination program on those that belong to the priority, vulnerable, and disadvantaged sectors of the population,” he said.\n",
      "He maintained that if allowed, the LGUs and the private sector should only buy vaccines that have been issued with emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The administration of vaccines to their targeted recipients must also abide by the rules and procedures set by the Department of Health (DOH) and other government agencies.\n",
      "During the Senate Committee of the Whole hearing on the government’s vaccination plan last January 15, officials said the vaccine makers were not keen about directly negotiating with LGUs and companies as they refused to take responsibility over their products, which are still under clinical trials.They also noted that with an EUA, the vaccines cannot be sold for commercial use so only the national government can procure them from the manufacturers.\n",
      "National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also said all the vaccines purchased by the LGUs and the private sector will be handled and administered by the DOH.\n",
      "Companies must also comply with the government’s prioritization rule for the inoculation, with low-income frontliners and essential workers first, before giving the vaccine to their other employees.Executives and their families should not be counted in the vaccine purchase as pharmaceutical firms follow the “equitable access” policy by the World Health Organization.\n",

      "This in order to implement the national program for vaccination in times of epidemics, pandemics, national health emergencies and other circumstances authorized by the Secretary of Health, amending for this purpose sections 11 and 12 of Republic Act of No. 2382 also known as ‘’The Medical Act of 1959.’’\n",
      "‘’With the development of a number of vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 disease, countries are faced with the daunting challenge of administering the vaccine to a record number of people,’’ Gordon said.\n",
      "Gordon had questioned the capability to conduct the vaccination program with only 617,239 health care workers to participate in the campaign based on the DOH’s data.\n",
      "The Philippines, according to Gordon, has to vaccinate 50 million to 70 million people to be able to achieve herd immunity.\n",
      "‘’This is especially challenging since our own DOH has a woeful performance in immunization. It has been failing to meet its immunization targets year by year,’’ he pointed out. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "In a meeting with President Duterte and some Cabinet members, Galvez reported they were able to negotiate for a lower vaccine price that brought the country’s total secured supply to 148 million doses from the original 70 million.\n",
      "“Maipapangako ko po sa ating mga mahal na kababayan na ang lahat ng mga negosasyon at cost, meaning, almost no profit.

And when I computed the cost of brands, it showed that we saved $700 million),” Galvez said in his remarks aired on state television.As a result of the sale at cost price, Galvez noted that the government was able to buy more doses of vaccines from suppliers.\n",
      "“‘Yung kanyang offer price, naibaba po natin ng halos kalahati. So kaya po ang nangyari po, iyong dati po natin, ‘yung plano po namin ni Secretary Duque na 70 million doses umangat po, Mr. President, ng 148 million doses (We were able to bring down their price offer to almost half. Secretary Duque and I planned to secure 70 million doses but the figure increased to 148 million doses, Mr. President),” he said.\n",

At saka po, totoo po kayo na wala po akong hawak na pera (We are telling our people that our deals are clean. It is true that I’m not holding the funds for the purchase),” he said.\n",
      "Galvez said that he could not divulge the actual price of the vaccines since he is bound by the confidentiality clause in the initial supply deal.On the varying vaccine costs, Galvez said that the price becomes cheaper if supplies are bought in bulk or if a country has its own filling station or even a manufacturing site. The vaccine cost can also be reduced if the buyer gets the supply from the country of the manufacturer instead of paying for their freight expenses.\n",
      "“Katulad po ng Sinovac, in-offer-an po tayo ng filling station. Pagka filling station po, kalahati po dapat ang babayaran lang natin dahil tayo po ang magfi-finish. Raw materials dadalhin dito, tayo na po ang magfi-filling station (Sinovac offered us a filling station. With a filling station, only half of the cost will be paid because we will do the finishing. They will bring the raw materials and we will handle the filling station),” he said.\n",
      "Galvez said Thailand could have cheaper vaccines since it has its own manufacturing facility for the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca.Galvez, who has been pressed by some lawmakers to disclose the vaccine cost during a recent Senate hearing, admitted that the companies “warned” him that he signed a non disclosure agreement.\n",
      "“Anything that you will disclose even when in public and even in the executive session, they have to follow ‘yung CDA.” Unless, they also have to sign the CDA with us,” he said, quoting the manufacturer.\n",

      "“If you want to follow the experience of Norway, go ahead, nobody would stop you,” he said, alluding to the reported deaths among several elderly people in Norway after taking the Pfizer vaccines.“But this I can tell you, we never prohibited anybody from buying from the government,” he added.The government is under fire over its alleged preference for the coronavirus vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech despite its alleged high cost and low efficacy rate. Around 25 million doses of the Sinovac vaccines have already been secured by the government but the use of the supply will still be subject to the approval of the FDA. Authorities insisted that the vaccine dose cost less than P700 and has shown efficacy in global clinical trials.\n",
      "Several local government units and the private sector have chosen to purchase 17 million additional vaccine doses from British drugmaker AstraZeneca. An initial 2.6 million doses have been secured in a deal sealed late last year. The supply deals were forged under a tripartite arrangement with the national government.\n",
      "Some lawmakers have asked the government to let the local officials, as well as private companies, purchase their own supplies without interference to hasten the vaccination of Filipinos.\n",
      "In a speech last week, the President said the national government would not meddle with the local government units that bought their own vaccine supply for their constituents. Duterte, however, made it clear that the vaccines must still pass the FDA’s scrutiny to check for their safety and efficacy. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "By Leng Shumei and Hu YuweiA video of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic welcoming the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccines in the cold wind went viral on Chinese social media platforms over the weekend, touching millions of Chinese netizens who applauded Vucic’s strong endorsement of Chinese vaccines, which is of much significance amid fierce smearing from some Western media outlets.“I went to the airport not only to receive the high-quality vaccines, but to demonstrate the friendship between China and Serbia,” Vucic said Saturday according to a video posted by the People’s Daily on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.A health worker receives a dose of COVID-19 vaccine from China in Istanbul, Turkey, Jan. 14, 2021. (Xinhua / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Vucic made the remarks at Nikola Tesla International Airport after receiving the first batch of one million doses of COVID-19 vaccines produced by China’s pharmaceutical company Sinopharm together with local officials, and the Chinese Ambassador to Serbia Chen Bo in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, on Saturday, according to the People’s Daily.\n",
      "This batch was said to be the first large-scale arrival of all eight million vaccines Serbia purchased from three different producers.Serbia has also purchased Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine as well as a vaccine jointly developed by the US’ Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech. The country plans to vaccinate 80 percent of its population of seven million, according to the Xinhua News Agency.In an apparent show of confidence in Chinese vaccines, the Serbian president said that he would get vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine, Xinhua reported.\n",
      "Vucic is not the only foreign president or senior official who is confident in China’s vaccines. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had his first dose of CoronaVac, produced by China’s Sinovac on Thursday, the day Turkey kicked off mass inoculations using CoronaVac after the authorities approved emergency use of the Chinese vaccine, Xinhua reported.\n",
      "At least 20 countries have purchased COVID-19 vaccines developed by Chinese manufacturers including Sinovac, Sinopharm and Cansino, according to the Global Times’ calculations, with more planning to purchase Chinese vaccines despite some Western media’s intense scrutiny over their efficacy and safety.China has promised to provide its vaccines as a global public good to lead the worldwide recovery from the pandemic and has also revealed on some occasions it will donate vaccines to certain countries.\n",
      "On Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi concluded a six-day visit to Southeast Asia, during which Wang said China decided to donate a batch of COVID-19 vaccines to Myanmar and the Philippines, continuing to help them combat the novel coronavirus, according to Xinhua.Boosting confidenceTurkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Saturday received the first dose of CoronaVac at the Ankara City Hospital, becoming the latest senior Turkish official to take a jabof Chinese vaccines, local media reported.More than 675,000 health workers have received the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac during the first three days of the country’s vaccination program, Xinhua reported Saturday citing the Turkish Health Ministry.Indonesia and Malaysia have also ordered Sinovac vaccines – 125.5 million and 14 million doses respectively. Thailand and the Philippines are expected to receive millions of doses from China in the coming months, according to Xinhua.\n",
      "The Indonesian Ambassador to China Djauhari Oratmangun told the Global Times in an exclusive interview on Thursday that “Indonesia’s trust and confidence in Sinovac’s vaccine is reflected in Widodo being the first to receive a jab. We share President Widodo’s sentiments”\n",
      "The long road ahead\n",
      "In a BBC report on Friday that many in China believe to be aimed at defaming Chinese vaccines, the reporter asked a Turkish doctor whether he was worried about the vaccine’s efficacy. The answer was an unequivocal “no.” The local doctor also noted that clinical trials of the vaccine in Turkey showed more than 90 percent efficacy.\n",
      "The doctor also admitted in the report that a level of distrust regarding Chinese vaccines is common around the world, maybe even reflecting the image of Chinese products in most people’s eyes. “Unfortunately, this is true,” said a Chinese vaccine industry insider reached by the Global Times.\n",
      "The pandemic has put Chinese vaccines under global scrutiny. Large numbers of overseas purchases have boosted confidence in them. But insiders noted that there is a long road ahead for them to explore the international market, especially given continuous politicization of the vaccines amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic is a great opportunity for Chinese vaccine producers but the challenge remains huge, the insider noted.Chinese vaccine producers have mostly focused on the domestic market before the COVID-19 pandemic and most of them barely export their products as the domestic market is big enough, a vaccine expert based in Changchun, Northeast China’s Jilin Province, told the Global Times on Sunday under the condition of anonymity.The international vaccine market has been mostly dominated by the big four major pharmaceutical companies, namely Pfizer, Merck, GSK and Sanofi, so there is little incentive or market space to encourage Chinese companies to branch out. \n",
      "The big four major producers occupy about 90 percent of the international vaccine market, according to a report from Guangfa Securities in March 2020.“But I can say that Chinese vaccines have no questions,” said the anonymous expert, noting that it will take time to establish a reputation in the international market. Chinese companies can treat the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to gradually increase international cooperation.Smear from the Western media outlets, especially after Brazilian authorities revealed a 50.4 percent efficacy rate in CoronaVac’s late-stage trials, is also a huge hurdle that prevents many people in the West from viewing Chinese vaccines in an objective and scientific way, Chinese observers noted.\n",
      "While hyping up doubt over CoronaVac’s late-stage data, mainstream English-language media mentioned little about the deaths of 23 elderly Norwegian people after they were vaccinated with Pfizer vaccines, as if those media outlets had already reached a consensus to downplay the incident.\n",
      "Yang Xiaoming, CEO of leading Chinese vaccine producer Sinopharm’s subsidiary China National Biotec Group (CNBG), previously told the Global Times that CNBG had never conducted such large-scale international Phase III clinical trials in cooperation with so many countries before.\n",
      "CNBG is conducting Phase III clinical trials on two of its inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in 10 countries covering more than 50,000 volunteers, according to Yang.\n",
      "“We have encountered many difficulties in communication and understanding local cultures and policies,” Yang said, noting that the solution to these difficulties is nothing else but communication.The anonymous expert suggests that Chinese vaccine companies can try to cooperate with Western countries like the US and the EU. It would be easier for the world to accept Chinese vaccines if they obtain certificates from authorities in these nations. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "While the US, Britain and European Union have given citizens about 24 million doses so far – more than half of the shots administered globally – vast numbers of countries have yet to begin their campaigns.Disparities in immunity pose a threat to both have and have-not states.\n",
      "Giving the coronavirus an opportunity to advance and generate new mutants would have significant economic and public-health consequences, adding to the pain as the death toll surpasses 2 million.\n",
      "Growth forecast\n",
      "“We cannot leave parts of the world without access to vaccines because it’s just going to come back to us,” said Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at health research foundation Wellcome.\n",
      "“That puts everyone around the world at risk.”Countries are relying on effective immunizations to save lives and revive businesses.\n",
      "The World Bank’s projection for 4% growth this year depends on widespread deployment of vaccines.\n",
      "Surging COVID cases and a delay to the delivery of inoculations, however, could limit expansion to just 1.6%.High-income countries have secured 85% of Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine and all of Moderna Inc.’s, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.\n",
      "Much of the world will be counting on U.K. drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, whose vaccine is cheaper and easier to distribute, along with other manufacturers such as China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.\n",
      "Of 42 countries rolling out COVID vaccines as of Jan. 8, 36 were high income countries and the rest were middle-income, according to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n",
      "A growing number of countries are pursuing their own supply deals, in addition to participating in a global collaboration known as Covax.\n",
      "Future Mutants\n",
      "Urgency is increasing as the pandemic extends into a second year.New variants that surfaced in the UK, South Africa and Brazil appear to spread significantly faster than earlier versions.\n",
      "Just in the past month, a “new dimension of risk has opened up for the world,” said Rajeev Venkayya, president of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s vaccines business.\n",
      "Reducing deaths and illnesses has been seen as the main driver of delivering vaccines rapidly, said Venkayya, who worked in the George W. Bush administration to develop a US pandemic flu plan and directed vaccine delivery for the Gates Foundation.\n",
      "“We now understand it’s also very, very important to control transmission,” he said, “not just to protect those most vulnerable populations, but also to reduce the evolutionary risk associated with this virus.”\n",
      "While there’s no evidence to suggest the current crop of vaccines are ineffective against those variants, future mutants may be less responsive, Wellcome’s Weller said.\n",
      "Drugmakers say they could tweak their shots to counter new variants within weeks if needed.\n",
      "The likelihood that such adaptations will be necessary has increased, Venkayya said.\n",
      "“The longer the virus is allowed to continue in different parts of the world where we don’t have a vaccine,” said Anna Marriott, health policy adviser at the anti-poverty group Oxfam, “the greater the danger of new variants that could be more aggressive, more virulent or transmissible.”\n",
      "COVID shots have been tested for their ability to prevent symptoms, not transmission.\n",
      "Still, their performance in clinical trials gives an indication of how effective they might be against spread.\n",
      "Effectiveness Gap\n",
      "The rollout of shots from PfizerBioNTech SE and Moderna that achieved efficacy levels of about 95% has raised questions about whether everyone will have access to such high levels of protection.\n",
      "“The gap isn’t just about access to vaccines,” said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n",
      "“It’s also about access to effective vaccines.” One of the shots lower- and middle-income countries are relying on, from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, sparked worries in Australia that it may not be effective enough to generate herd immunity.\n",
      "Health authorities there, however, said they believe it will be comparable to the Pfizer and Moderna shots in preventing people from getting seriously ill.\n",
      "The vaccine developed by the UK partners, introduced in the country earlier this month, delivered an average efficacy rate of 70%.\n",
      "That appeared to climb to 80% with a longer gap between doses, based on limited data available, according to regulators.\n",
      "Lengthening that period to as many as three months from one allows more people to get protected faster, while data show the level of antibodies also increases, an AstraZeneca spokesman said.\n",
      "“An optimized regimen which allows the vaccination of many more people upfront, together with a robust supply chain, means we can have a real impact on the pandemic,” he said in an email.\n",
      "Four vastly differing protection rates have been released on Sinovac’s shot, ranging from about 50% to more than 90%.\n",
      "The Chinese developer said the lower number seen in a trial in Brazil is due to participants being medical workers facing a high risk of contracting COVID.\n",
      "“Despite the difference in efficacy rate, they all point to the vaccine’s ability for protection, especially against mid- and severe disease,” Sinovac said.\n",
      "While the picture is still coming into focus, cleared vaccines are likely to be similarly effective in preventing serious sickness and death, said Takeda’s Venkayya.\n",
      "Where they could diverge is on side effects, the duration of protection and impact on transmission, an even more critical factor in light of new variants, he said.\n",
      "Even shots with a lower efficacy level could have a considerable impact.\n",
      "US regulators set a 50% threshold for deeming a candidate effective. But they would require a higher percentage of people willing to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, Huang said.\n",
      "If less-effective vaccines are distributed to emerging markets, it could have significant economic implications, too, and “sharpen differences in pandemic outcomes across countries,” Justin-Damien Guenette, a senior economist at the World Bank, wrote in an email.\n",
      "Many countries are depending on Covax, which aims to deploy vaccines equitably to every corner of the planet.\n",
      "Yet not all lower- and middle-income nations are waiting for a lifeline.\n",
      "Countries such as South Africa and Malaysia are also pursuing their own supply deals through direct talks with manufacturers, and some regions are set to receive Pfizer’s vaccine as well.\n",
      "‘Losing Patience’\n",
      "“There seem to be indications that countries are losing patience,” said Huang of the Council on Foreign Relations.\n",
      "Covax has secured access to almost 2 billion doses, with deliveries due to begin in the first quarter, and set a goal of vaccinating up to a fifth of countries’ populations by the end of the year.\n",
      "That’s far short of the levels of two-thirds or more that many nations are targeting. Some may not get vaccines until 2024, researchers estimate.\n",
      "The mobilization is ramping up. India, a nation of more than 1.3 billion people, kicked off a massive inoculation drive on Saturday, an effort expected to encounter challenges as it extends into rural areas.\n",
      "Vaccine advocates have called on rich countries to share while pushing companies to scale up manufacturing capacity.\n",
      "While it’s early, the trends are concerning, Venkayya said.\n",
      "“Success is defined as getting vaccines to people everywhere,” he said, “and we’re not yet successful in that endeavor.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "India’s campaign was also facing teething problems as it emerged that almost a third of the 300,000 people invited for a shot on the opening day didn’t turn up.“These are initial days and we understand people are waiting to see how the procedure pans out,” said Suneela Garg, a member of the coronavirus task force for New Delhi.\n",
      "“These numbers will go up as confidence is strengthened. And for that, we have to tackle misinformation.”\n",
      "– ‘Gift from God’ –\n",
      "Authorities worldwide have been mounting public information campaigns to address concerns over vaccine safety, and in the face of powerful online anti-vax movements.After 33 elderly people who had received a first dose died in Norway, authorities there stressed there was no proven link between the jabs and the deaths. They recommended, however, that doctors consider patients’ frailty before immunising them.\n",

      "“I need to be blunt. The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure,” Tedros said. “And the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world’s poorest countries.”Israel, praised for one of the world’s fastest rollouts, has secured a significant stock of vaccines partly by pledging to quickly share data on its impact with Pfizer, according to an agreement with the drug company seen by AFP.\n",
      "– Bleak times for travel economy –\n",
      "Despite the mass immunisation campaigns now under way, spiralling infection rates have left governments reliant on continuing curbs on people’s daily lives.Nearly three million people in China’s northeastern Jilin province were put under lockdown Monday after a surge in cases, while Malawi introduced an overnight curfew.\n",
      "Globally, travel remains at a trickle of its usual pace — and there were signs Monday of the price being paid by companies and countries reliant on tourism.Disneyland Paris — Europe’s biggest tourist attraction — announced it was delaying its reopening until April, while train operator Eurostar made a desperate plea for British state support.\n",
      "“Without additional funding from government there is a real risk to the survival of Eurostar,” the cross-Channel service said.\n",

      "Whether rich or poor, all local government units will receive from the national government COVID-19 vaccines that will cover 70 percent of their population, with the more affluent getting the advantage of inoculating 100 percent of local population.\n",
      "Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 (NTF AGAINST COVID-19 / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Thus, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez stressed that LGUs, mostly in Metro Manila, that have money to spare to purchase vaccines for their constituents will have a bigger chance of inoculating a larger part of their population.\n",
      "Nearly all LGUs in Metro Manila, led by the cities of Quezon, Makati, Manila, Navotas, Pasig and Caloocan, are ready to spend to purchase vaccines that would add to their 70 percent share from the national government.These LGUs have entered into tripartite procurement agreements whereby the national government would stand as the middleman in vaccine procurement with pharmaceutical firms such as Astra-Zeneca.\n",
      "“The arrangement is that in case they (LGUs) opted to buy the vaccine, we will take care of the supplies and how to administer these,” Galvez told the House Committee on Health during the briefing on the national vaccination roadmap.Also thechief implementer of the government’s anti- COVID 19 action plan, Galvez said many LGUs have decided to use their own budget to increase the number of their constituents who will be protected from the dreaded coronavirus disease.\n",
      "“They want to augment their supply because they want to immediately revive their economy and ensure better protection for their people,’ he said.\n",
      "Also during the hearing, Marinduque Governor and League of Provinces of the Philippines president Presbitero Velasco assured Galvez that the country’s provinces and LGUs are in full support of the national government’s vaccination program.However, Velasco sought an assurance from Galvez that the LGUs that were able to procure their own supply will still be allowed to access the state-procured vaccine supply.Velasco, father of Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, also stressed that LGUs want an assurance from the government that they will be allowed to procure directly vaccines from their respective supliers.“Of course it has to pass through the national government, but we want clear authority to negotiate directly with the suppliers,” said Velasco, a retired Supreme Court associate justice.Earlier, Deputy Speaker and Cagayan de Oro City Rep. Rufus Rodriguez filed House Resolution No. 1460 calling on the national government to grant LGUs the authority to directly procure their vaccines from manufacturers.“Coordinated proper vaccination programs by the LGUs will significantly aid the government in its pursuit to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, especially regaining some semblance of normalcy with businesses bouncing back and ultimately placing the economy well on its way back to recovery,” said Rodriguez.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Sen. Sonny Angara\n",
      "(Joseph Vidal / Senate PRIB / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Angara, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, reiterated that the information on the various prices of vaccines, particularly that of China’s Sinovac Biotech, were provided by the DOH to his office and was meant as a guide for senators who were inquiring about details of the vaccines during the plenary debates last November 2020.\n",
      "“Sen. Angara has neither claimed that he was the source of the data nor said anything about the accuracy of the said prices then and now,” Angara’s office said in a statement.\n",
      "“What was presented during the plenary debates and subsequently quoted in various social media posts was a straightforward citation of the data provided by the DOH to the Office of Sen. Angara,” the statement also read.\n",

      "Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso said that, although it may take a few months before the vaccines arrive in the country, the city has to prepare for it with the necessary equipment.\n",
      "“In the meantime, we are preparing other facilities, our logistic capabilities, process of deployment, and future clients on top of medical frontliners and senior citizens,” he told reporters.“What we did, in our own little way, is to buy all types of freezers and refrigerators for all types of vaccines,” he added.\n",
      "Among some of the equipment that arrived are five refrigerator HYC-390, that can store AstraZeneca and/or Sinovac vials; two -25°C biomedical freezers and two -30°C biomedical freezers, that can store Janssen and/or Moderna vaccine vials.Domagoso said three -86°C ULT freezers, that can store Pfizer vaccine vials, are expected to arrive next week.\n",
      "Each refrigeration unit is equipped with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to ensure the integrity of the vaccines. The equipment will be placed inside the Manila COVID-19 Vaccine Storage Facility at the Sta. Ana Hospital, which is also equipped with a power generator.\n",
      "The Manila mayor said they are set to inaugurate the storage facility by the end of January.The city government also bought 50 transport coolers that will be used for the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "The new equipment costed the city government around P9 million, Domagoso said.\n",

      "The selection of coronavirus vaccines should not be compared to choosing laundry soap as suggested by a comedian due to its limited global supply, according to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque.\n",
      "Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque\n",
      "(OPS / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Unlike detergent soaps that have an abundant market supply, Roque explained the Philippines and other developing countries are scrambling to secure vaccines from the remaining 18 percent global vaccine supply. The bulk of the coronavirus vaccines in the market, he added, has been secured by wealthy nations.\n",
      "Roque made the statement after comedian Vice Ganda commented that if Filipinos are choosy with laundry soap, they are also expected to be more selective when it comes to vaccines that will be injected into their body.“Dahil sa limitadong supply ng mga bakuna, hinditayo makakapili ng isa o dalawang brand (Because of the limited supply of the vaccines, we cannot one or two brands),” Roque said during a televised press briefing Monday.\n",
      "“Alam ninyo, mali naman ikukumpara ang bakuna sa sabon nasa panlaba. Ang katunayan po, wala naman supply na ganoon kadami. Nag-aagawan nga tayo sa 18 percent na available na supply (You know it is wrong to compare the vaccines with laundry soap. In fact, there is no such huge supply. We are scrambling for the 18 percent of the available supply),” he added.\n",
      "According to Roque, the public should trust health experts, not comedians, in determining the safety and efficacy of the vaccines developed to protect against the coronavirus illness. He did not mention any name of comedian in his remarks.\n",
      "“Hindi lang naman ito gagamitin para sa damit kaya nga hindi lang isa , hindi lang dalawa, kung hindi tatlong grupo pa ng eksperto ang magsusuri kung ang mga bakuna ay ligtas at epektibo (Also, this will not be used for clothes. That’s why there are three groups of experts, not just one or two, to study if the vaccines are safe and effective),” he said.“Kung hindi naman pagtitiwalaan ang experts na 3 batches of experts na magsasabi na puwede nating gamitin ‘yan at magiging basehanpara mag-issue ang FDA (Food and Drug Administration) ng EUA (emergency use authorization), sino pagkakatiwalaan? Siguro po hindi ang mga komedyante (If we do not trust the word of three batches of experts who can say we can use the vaccines and can be the basis if the FDA will issue an EUA, who will we trust? Maybe not the comedians),” he added.\n",
      "Roque assured the public that the government would only administer COVID vaccines that are proven safe and effective by health authorities.“Uulitin ko po, supply and demand. kung ano ang napatunayan na ligtas at epektibo, ito ang gagamitin natin dahil ang nais natin ay masalba ang pinakamaramingkababayan natin sa lalong mabilis na panahon (I repeat, it’s about supply and demand. We will use what has been proven safe and effective because we want to save as many people as soon as possible),” he said.Last week, Vice Ganda reacted to Roque’s pronouncement that people could not choose the brand of coronavirus vaccines to be given free by the government. Roque earlier said the beneficiary in the priority list who declines the free vaccine will have to be place on the back of the line to wait for their turn.\n",
      "“Sa sabong panlaba nga choosy tayo e sa bakuna pa kaya. Ano to basta may maisaksak lang?! Vaklang twoooaahhh!!!” @vicegandako tweeted on Jan. 12.\n",
      "The government aims to secure 148 million vaccine doses to vaccinate around 70 million people to achieve herd immunity. So far, the government has negotiated 30 million vaccines doses from Serum Institute of India and 25 million doses from China’s Sinovac BioTech. Around 20 million doses from AstraZeneca have been secured by the private sector and local government units.\n",

      "As the government ramps up the acquisition of coronavirus vaccines from foreign suppliers, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the vaccine passports would help facilitate safe mobility among those who have received the shot.\n",
      "“DOH (Department of Health) po ang magi-isyu niyan (The DOH will issue the vaccine passports),” Roque said over “Unang Hirit” program on GMA-7 Monday.“At importante po iyong passport na iyan kasi iyan ang magiging susi doon sa ating tinatawag na mobility, para tayo makaikot, makabiyahe, makapag-resume ng ating normal na buhay bago tumama ang pandemic (The passport is important because that will serve as the key to our mobility so we can go around, travel, return to our normal life before the pandemic hit),” he added.\n",
      "Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire had earlier announced the government’s planned establishment of a data registry for all vaccine recipients. A QR code will be issued to show information about the vaccinated person.\n",
      "She said the vaccine passports, which will be proof that a person has taken the shot, would likely be part of the protocol for border control of countries around the globe.\n",
      "The government has secured supplies of millions of coronavirus vaccines with the initial shipment expected to arrive next month.The first COVID vaccine doses to be shipped will come from American drugmaker Pfizer and China’s Sinovac.Of the pending applications, local drug regulators have so far approved the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer vaccines in the country.The Palace has repeatedly defended the government’s purchase of the Chinese-made vaccines in the wake of criticisms about its supposed high cost and poor efficacy rate.\n",
      "Roque insisted that the Sinovac vaccines cost around P650 similar to the price estimated in Indonesia, contrary to reports about it being expensive.The government could not yet disclose the exact amount of the vaccines due to the confidentiality clause until the supply agreement is signed, he added.\n",
      "Asked if the government could still cancel the Sinovac order,Roque said: “Anything is possible.”\n",
      "He maintained though that President Duterte wants to save as many people as possible with the help of the vaccines especially in the face of the new coronavirus variant.\n",
      "He said the immunization drive using Sinovac vaccines will push through if it gets an approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n",
      "“Ang dahilan po para hindi siya matuloy ay kung hindi siya bibigyan ng approval ng FDA (The only reason it will not push through is if it does not get the approval from FDA),” he said.“Kapag binigyan ng approval ng FDA, ang Presidente na ang nagsabi, tabla-tabla po iyan, pare-pareho iyan in terms if iyong safety at saka iyong pagiging epektibo (Once it secures FDA approval, the President has said the vaccines are on equal footing.

      "Norway expressed increasing concern about the safety of the Pfizer Inc. vaccine on elderly people with serious underlying health conditions after raising an estimate of the number who died after receiving inoculations to 29.\n",
      "(Daniel Schludi / UNSPLASH / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The latest figure adds six to the number of known fatalities in Norway, and lowers the age group thought to be affected to 75 from 80. While it’s unclear exactly when the deaths occurred, Norway has given at least one dose to about 42,000 people and focused on those considered most at risk if they contract the virus, including the elderly.\n",
      "Until Friday, the vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech SE was the only one available in Norway, and “all deaths are thus linked to this vaccine,” the Norwegian Medicines Agency said in a written response to Bloomberg on Saturday.“There are 13 deaths that have been assessed, and we are aware of another 16 deaths that are currently being assessed,” the agency said. All the reported deaths related to “elderly people with serious basic disorders,” it said. “Most people have experienced the expected side effects of the vaccine, such as nausea and vomiting, fever, local reactions at the injection site, and worsening of their underlying condition.”\n",
      "Official reports of allergic reactions have been rare as governments rush to roll out vaccines to try to contain the global pandemic. US authorities reported 21 cases of severe allergic reactions from Dec. 14-23 after administration of about 1.9 million initial doses of the Pfizer vaccine.\n",
      "The first Europe-wide safety report on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is due to be published at the end of January.\n",
      "Australia’s concern\n",
      "Australia, which has an agreement for 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, is seeking urgent information on the issue from the producer, health authorities and Norway’s government, Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday.Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration will seek “additional information, both from the company, but also from the Norwegian medical regulator,” Hunt said. Australia’s foreign ministry will also contact its counterpart in Norway on the issue.\n",
      "Norway’s experience doesn’t mean that younger, healthier people should avoid being vaccinated. But it’s an early indication of what to watch as countries begin to issue safety monitoring reports on the vaccines. Emer Cooke, the new head of the European Medicines Agency, has said tracking the safety of COVID vaccines, especially those relying on novel technologies such as messenger RNA, would be one of the biggest challenges once shots are rolled out widely.\n",
      "Though the two COVID-19 vaccines approved so far in Europe were tested in tens of thousands of people — including volunteers in their late 80s and 90s — the average trial participant was in his or her early 50s. The first people to be immunized in many places have been older than that as countries rush to inoculate nursing-home residents at high risk from the virus.The findings have prompted Norway to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines may be too risky for the very old and terminally ill, the most cautious statement yet from a European health authority.\n",
      "The Norwegian Institute of Public Health judges that “for those with the most severe frailty, even relatively mild vaccine side effects can have serious consequences. For those who have a very short remaining life span anyway, the benefit of the vaccine may be marginal or irrelevant.”\n",
      "Pfizer and BioNTech are working with the Norwegian regulator to investigate the deaths in Norway, Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement. The agency found that “the number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in\n",

      "Frontline workers such as hospital staff, people over 50 and those deemed to be at high risk due to pre-existing medical conditions are on the shortlist to receive the vaccines.\n",

      "Filipinos who are currently working in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) can avail themselves of free COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccination being offered by the host government to all local residents to stem the spread of the disease.Philippine Ambassador to the UAE Hjayceelyn Quintana said the Department of Health (DOH) – Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre are encouraging the public to get Sinopharm vaccine for free by booking an appointment with the Abu Dhabi Health Services (SEHA).Administered in two doses 21 days apart, the Sinopharm vaccine was earlier declared by the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) as 86 percent effective.Last month, Dubai also announced the rollout of the free Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine by the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) in addition to the free Sinopharm vaccine rollout UAE-wide.\n",

These include House Bill Nos. 8316 and 8317, which seek to grant President Duterte the power to suspend the scheduled increases in the contribution rates of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp.

      "These were the proposed Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer or FIST Act, Bureau of Fire Protection Modernization Act, Internet Transaction Act and Coconut Farmers and Industry Trust Fund Act.\n",

      "As directed by Velasco, the House Committee on Health, chaired byQuezon 4th District Rep. Angelina “Helen” Tan will look into the “government’s National COVID-19 Vaccine Roadmap and the efficacy of the life-saving shots to be administered in the country.”\n",
      "“Our goal is to make sure that every Filipino will have access to safe and effective vaccine, which is currently the best way for us to beat the virus and move forward,” Velasco said in a statement.Under the 2021 General Appropriations Act signed by President Duterte last December 28, P72.5 billion was earmarked for the purchase, storage, transportation and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and another P2 billion was allocatedfor the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the country’s health workers.Tan said the hearing is aimed at ensuring that there will be“just, fair and equal” distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",

      "The latest solon to make such an appeal was San Jose Del Monte City Rep. Florida Robes, who noted Sunday, Jan. 17, that there is “too much information” on the vaccines, to the point that Filipinos are getting confused and anxious about it.\n",
      "“The government, particularly the [Inter- Agency Task Force on the Management], should go on a massive information drive to give the real score on the vaccines and the vaccination program that soon will be rolled out when we have the vaccines,” she said.Robes, House Committee on People’s Participation chair, has been spearheading dialogues between international pharmaceutical companies and local health officials in order to facilitate the approval of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines.\n",
      "She said that based on her numerous talks with her constituents, many have expressed their apprehension on receiving the anti-COVID jabs because of questions on safety and efficacy.\n",
      "“Initially they wanted to get the vaccine but with the many information that they get from social media, [most of which] are not true, they are now having second thoughts. We should allay their fears through a massive information drive that will go all the way to the grassroots,” she said.\n",
      "Robes expressed confidence that the Duterte administration will choose a vaccine that is proven safe and effective.“I know that they have the best interest of the Filipino people at heart. It’s just that there is just a lot of disinformation,” she said.\n",
      "Deputy Speaker and Mandaluyong Rep. Neptali Gonzales II earlier asked the Department of Health (DoH) to seize the opportunity and launch a COVID vaccine educational campaign while the country waits for its supply of the antigen.\n",
      "“All the billions of pesos appropriated by the government will simply go to waste if a substantial number of the people targeted by the vaccination program of the government will just refuse to be vaccinated, out of fear borne [from a] lack of information and understanding of the advantages of having it,” he said.Like Robes, Gonzales had also learned that a lot of his constituents were against having themselves vaccinated due to safety concerns and basic lack of knowledge.\n",
      "“A massive information drive should really be fast-tracked on the ground level, so that the government’s national vaccination program will fully be successful,” he stressed. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“So what we have now is a clearance for the use of vaccines in people above 16 years,” said Abeyasinghe.He said that vaccine developers did not prioritize kids on the clinical trials because of the “low risk of disease in children [and] also because of the critical imports of ensuring the vaccines are safe in the first place, among adults before they are tried on children.”\n",
      "Abeyasinghe said that studies are now being conducted on the possible effects of COVID-19 vaccines to children.“We are closely working with the vaccine manufacturers, the academe and the research partners to better understand this. But the key issue is that, that is going to take time and maybe, in a few months, we will have better evidence to confidently say that these vaccines are safe and effective for children,”he said.“As time goes, as global experience increases, it will become clear whether these vaccines can be used for children and whether they are safe and effective. Once we have that evidence, we can consider the option for vaccinating children.”Meanwhile, the WHO official suggested conducting another survey on the willingness of Filipinos to get vaccinated against the viral disease.Abeyasinghe made the remark after he was asked on the recent survey results of Pulse Asia—- which reported that 47 percent of the 2,400 adult Filipinos who were surveyed said they do not want to get vaccinated against the viral disease due to safety concerns.“I like to draw attention to the fact that the Pulse Asia Survey was conducted at the end of November, before the second of December, and that was the time that we did not have emergency use authorization for any of the COVID vaccine,” he said.\n",
      "“So that question was asked in a space where nobody knew about the possibility of COVID-19 vaccines becoming available so soon and about their safety and use in other countries. So we need to really ask this question again.”SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Speaking on her radio show, Robredo said Duterte can help boost Filipinos’ confidence on COVID-19 vaccines when he gets vaccinated in public.“So it will be helpful if the person whom people look up to will show to them that there is nothing to worry about. I hope it is taken into consideration,” she said in response to Duterte’s recent remark he will be among the last to get a shot of the vaccine after the inoculation of frontliners and vulnerable sectors.\n",
      "Duterte had said in August last year he was willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine first upon its arrival in the country.Robredo cited the mass vaccinations in Indonesia wherePresident Joko Widodo received his first dose of the China-made Sinovac vaccine in public.\n",
      "“It seems there is no controversy about it. It could mean they have effective communications plan. Maybe they were able to explain to their people why it is their decision (of choosing Sinovac),” she said.In a survey, Filipinos indicated they are worried about the safety of the vaccine. On social media, memes about China-made products have also made rounds, further lowering the confidence about Sinovac.\n",
      "Robredo attributed the controversy surrounding the choice of COVID-19 vaccine to the government’s failure to communicate properly to the public.“Some of our government officials are coming up with statements that do not help. There is controversy because, whether true or not, it seems that we’re taking the side of a particular vaccine (when) the people acknowledge that there is a better one,” she said.The opposition leaderdisputed the country’s vaccination program is just being politicized.“There are concerns that should be addressed. First is the low efficacy rate. Second is the reason why we are paying more for it compared to other countries. And third is why it (Sinovac) is being prioritized over others,” she said.

      "DAVAO CITY – Some businessmen have already approached the local government of Davao, expressing their intention to contribute to the purchase of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines, Mayor Sara Duterte said.\n",
      "Duterte said, during her program over Davao City Disaster Radio (DCDR 87.5), that the private sector was willing to help the local government in its fight against COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "However, the mayor did not reveal the identity of the businessmen and the amount that was pledged to the city.She said the city government could not yet accept their offer because of the limitations in the procurement process for the vaccines.\n",
      "“The city government did not accept the money from the private sector because even us, in the local government, can’t directly go to the vaccine-maker and say we will buy vaccines,” she said.\n",
      "Local government units may only procure COVID-19 vaccines by entering into a tripartite deal with the national government and vaccine-maker.\n",
      "Last Thursday, a tripartite agreement among the national government, local government units, private sector, and vaccine manufacturer was signed to purchase additional 14.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.This will bring to 17 million the total vaccines to be procured under a tripartite scheme for the country, according to the National Task Force COVID-19.\n",
      "AstraZeneca committed to deliver initial doses of AZD1222, the vaccine jointly developed by the British and with Oxford University, to Davao City by the third quarter of this year.\n",
      "Duterte said the city’s supply of vaccines will augment the nationwide vaccination program, targeting individuals who are not in the priority list of the national government.The national government will give priority to frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens, remaining senior citizens, remaining indigent population, and uniformed personnel.\n",
      "She said the local government did not set a ceiling on the budget for vaccines since it will also negotiate for more supply from other pharmaceutical firms.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Duterte said the local government was not expecting the local economy to recover this year.\n",

      "Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said Sunday he supports calls for another round of Senate inquiry on the rollout of the government’s COVID-19 vaccination program.\n",
      "Drilon said the Senate Committee of the Whole should furnish only a preliminary – not final – report on the two hearings held on the government’s vaccination plan. The Senate minority leader pointed out the two-day inquiry left more questions than it answered.\n",
      "Senator Franklin Drilon\n",
      "(Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“There are still a number of issues hanging. These too many unanswered questions raise grave concerns, for the survival of the country largely depends on our ability to implement a successful vaccination program against COVID-19 virus,” Drilon said in a statement.\n",
      "“We did not get any definite answers to these serious questions. I believe another round of hearing is in order. I support the call of Sen. Panfilo Lacson for more hearings,” the senator said.\n",
      "Drilon said the most urgent unanswered questions are issues about the pricing, the sourcing of the vaccines, the delivery schedules, and logistical support plan.“It was evident that preparations are not sufficient. We all want this vaccination plan to succeed. The Senate should continue to exercise its oversight power,” he said.\n",
      "“The Senate has no agenda but to give the public access to information about the government’s vaccination plan,” he stressed.\n",
      "Drilon lamented that the lack of access to information fuels doubts and confusion among the public.\n",
      "A Senate hearing, he said, would be an opportunity for the public to be informed of the government’s vaccination plan and scrutinize the same.\n",
      "“The success of the vaccination program – and the country’s economic recovery – depends on the ability to inoculate at least 60 percent of our population,” he said.\n",
      "“How will the government convince people that the vaccines are safe? How can we strengthen our people’s confidence in the anti-coronavirus vaccine?” he added.\n",
      "Sen. Panfilo “Ping” Lacson said last Saturday senators may manifest an intention to hold another hearing on the issues hounding the State’s inoculation plan when sessions resume Monday.Lacson said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. should answer senators’ questions about the government dealing with Sinovac president Helen Yang, who is based in Hong Kong.\n",

He likewise affirmed China’s resolve to do everything to ensure that vaccines become a global good,” Malacañang said.\n",

      "“The recovery of nations… sits on the back of stronger economies, Duterte told Wang.\n",
      "“China plays a very key role in reviving our region’s economy. Let us do all we can to revive economic activities between the Philippines and China,” he added.Malacañang said that President Duterte conveyed appreciation for China’s continuing support and cooperation in the country’s fight against COVID-19 in terms of medical equipment and supplies and sharing of experiences and expertise as well as in the repatriation of Filipino nationals.

      "“Our health is our right. This is not a privilege that will only be accessible to a few. We have the right to demand (for information) that will affect our health,” Robredo said on her Sunday radio show.\n",
      "The vice president urged the government to address concerns about the efficacy and the prices of the COVID-19 vaccine.Robredo said the people assigned to the procurement of the vaccines should disclose pertinent information that will instill confidence in the country’s vaccination program.\n",
      "“The disclosure of the prices of the vaccine will help boost the people’s confidence in the program. This is not a take-it-or-leave-it deal. This is the way we can convince the people that inoculation of the vaccine is the way for us to go back to normal,” she said.\n",
      "“If we are not going to exert any effort to tell the truth and address their concerns, this will not help in boosting their confidence,” Robredo explained.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. refused to reveal to senators the price by which the government is procuring the China-made Sinovac vaccines because of the non-disclosure agreement. He assured the chamber that Sinovac is cheaper than the ones offered by United States-produced vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna.But in reports, Sinovac is said to cost P3,629.50 for two doses against Pfizer’s P2,379, Moderna’s P3,904 to 4,504, and AstraZeneca’s P610. This is a far cry from the Rp200,000 (P700) per dose that Indonesia paid for Sinovac.\n",
      "Robredo clarified that she isn’t discriminating against the vaccine’s manufacturer, but just wants assurance of its efficacy and cost.\n",
      "She argued that the public has the right to question the cost of the vaccines because the government is using the taxpayers’ money for their procurement.It’s normal for the people to want to know about the vaccine’s efficacy rate since their health depends on it, Robredo said, adding that the government has an obligation to clarify these issues.\n",
      "Pfizer has a reported 95% efficacy rate while Moderna has 94%. After two doses, AstraZeneca’s efficacy rate also jumps to 90%.\n",
      "But what bothers a lot of Filipinos is the lower efficacy rate of Sinovac, the vaccine that’s scheduled to arrive in the Philippines next month. While some reports indicate the China-made vaccine also has an efficacy rate of 91%, others reported it could be only 78% or even around 50%. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Despite a ‘’government to government’’ (G to G) policy in negotiating for the supply of vaccines, the national government is dealing with a ‘’Helen Yang’’ based in Hong Kong representing Sinovac, a privateChinese pharmaceutical firm, and not with the Chinese government, Lacson pointed out.\n",

      "When asked by Sen.Nancy Binay whether the National Task Force could still back out of its commitment with Sinovac, Galvez replied in the affirmative.\n",
      "From a plate of seven foreign-made vaccines, senators were not comfortable with Sinovac because of its low efficacy rate and it is relatively expensive.\n",
      "They fielded questions scrutinizing the ‘’seeming’’ preference of task force officials for Sinovac vaccines.\n",
      "They also asked Galvez to explain why the government signed an agreement to secure 25 million doses of Sinovac’s vaccine, considering that its Phase 3 trials are still being consolidated and the company had yet to secure emergency use approval (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration.

      "“Having a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine ready for deployment to the Filipino people at a time where no available treatment has yet been developed provides us a long-term solution and a higher chance of successfully defeating the virus,” she said.\n",
      "“This milestone is another proof that science, despite the challenge of compressing to compress into months a process that usually takes a decade or more to complete, is pivotal in the fight against an unprecedented public health emergency which has already claimed millions of lives globally, and is still affecting millions more in so many aspects worldwide, including the Philippines,” she added.\n",
      "Under the EUA, the FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products in an emergency situation to treat or prevent life-threatening diseases when certain statutory criteria have been met.\n",
      "Guevera mentionedthat “While this is not yet a Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) or a marketing authorization, we are confident that the principles of science and regulatory reliance were adopted by our Filipino scientific experts in the process of evaluating the available safety and effectiveness data of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine.”\n",
      "“This significant step strengthens the commitment of the Department of Science and Technology’s (DoST) commitment, as part of the NTF COVID-19 Task Group on Vaccine Evaluation and Selection (VES), to provide Filipinos the best scientific and innovative solutions to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic,” she added.

      "Deputy Speaker Buhay party-list Rep. Lito Atienza blamed the previous Cayetano Speakership for the measly initial appropriation for COVID-19 vaccine procurement under the 2021 national budget.\n",
      "Atienza touched on this matter in a statement Friday in response to a criticism from Taguig-Pateros Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano against current Speaker Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco.\n",
      "Cayetano and his allies have earlier faulted the Velasco leadership for not actively holding public hearing or investivations on topics of public interest, such as the vaccination and PhilHealth issues.“There were no investigations yet because we prioritized cleaning up the mess that was left in the GAB (General Appropriations Bill) and reopened the budget hearings that Cayetano and his allies unceremoniously closed, which was why we uncovered the weakest link of the GAB – the pathetic P2.5-billion budget for COVID vaccines,” Atienza said.\n",
      "The GAB represents the initial filing of the proposed national budget in Congress, specifically in the 300-member House of Representatives.\n",
      "Atienza in the statement recalled that last Oct. 6, then-Speaker Cayetano moved to terminate plenary deliberations on the P4.5-trillion GAB before approving the measure on second reading and suspending sessions until Nov. 16, 2020.\n",
      "But last Oct. 12, an overwhelming majority of House lawmakers ousted Cayetano and elected Velasco as Speaker. This took place a day before the start of the four-day special session called by President Duterte for Congress to pass the GAB. The House approved the budget bill on third and final reading on Oct. 16.\n",
      "Atienza said that after discovering the rather low amount of P2.5 billion that the Cayetano leadership had allocated for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, the Velasco-led House increased the vaccine budget to P8 billion, and later to P72.5 billion, under the budget bill.\n",
      "The Chief Executive signed the 2021 GAB into law last Dec. 28. The first to be crafted in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s national budget is seen as crucial in government’s delivery of both health and economic response.\n",

      "Marcos, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Economic Affairs, pointed out that three leading vaccine candidates that received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in Western countries had conducted trials in which less than five percent of participants were Asian.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reported that only 4.7 percent of participants in Moderna’s vaccine trials were Asian while the medical journal The Lancet showed that Asians averaged only 4.4 percent in UK and Brazil trials for the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n",
      "Although Pfizer placed the overall efficacy of its vaccine at 95 percent, only 4.3 percent of trial participants were Asian and efficacy particularly among non-whites was lower at 74.4 percent.\n",
      "The lack of a clearer breakdown of various Asian ethnicities in vaccine trials has also led health experts in India to call for greater participation of its ethnically diverse groups before granting an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Western-made vaccines, Marcos said.\n",
      "“Vaccines may actually be customized in the future,” Marcos added, citing a study published in December by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Using artificial intelligence and a vaccine similar to that of Pfizer and Moderna, MIT researchers found that Asians were less likely to respond to the experimental vaccine than Caucasians.

      "The Department of Finance (DOF) assured that the government has sufficiently funds to procure enough doses of COVID-19 vaccines from various sources in line with its target to inoculate around half of the population.\n",
      "In a statement, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said yesterday that the DOF has “in place” P75 billion of the P82.5 billion budget required to provide vaccines to at least 50 million Filipinos.Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III\n",
      "Of the P82.5 billion, P2.5 billion is already under the 2021 budget of the Department of Health (DOH), while P10 billion will come from the funds allocated for the COVID-19 vaccination program under the Bayanihan To Recover As One Act.Dominguez said the remaining P70 billion will be sourced fromloans provided by multilateral lenders,the Philippines’ bilateral partnersand/or the domestic market.\n",
      "The DOF currently is processing around P62.5 billion, or roughly $1.3 billion, through loans with multilateral banks to procure COVID-19 vaccines for adult Filipinos.\n",
      "These multilateral institutions include the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank (WB) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).\n",
      "According to Dominguez, the government is targeting to inoculate about 50 million to 70 million adult Filipinos aged 18 years old and above.\n",
      "“We have 110 million Filipinos. Of the 110 million, around 40 million are below the ages of 18 and it is not recommended that teenagers and below get the vaccine. So, you knock off 40 million out of 110 million. That leaves you 70 million Filipinos potentially to vaccinate,” he said.\n",
      "The COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use so far are only allowed for adults aged 18 years old and above, as there are no clinical trials yet involving children.\n",
      "Dominguez said initial computations place the conservative cost per person to be vaccinated at P1,300, which already includes the required doses, syringe, storage, equipment, information campaign, monitoringand other support services.\n",
      "At P1,300 per person, the government would be able to inoculate roughly 57 million to 60 million Filipinos out of the 70 million that need to be vaccinated, Dominguez said.“Now, that leaves you 13 million people. We expect the 13 million to be covered by the LGUs (local government units), the private sector, and of course,there are the recusants—the guys who don’t believe in vaccination,” Dominguez said.\n",
      "“So, basically, we are going to be covered and I think we will be able easily now,with the resources that we have raised,to vaccinate 60 million Filipinos,” he added.Earlier, Finance Undersecretary Mark Dennis Joven said the DOF has begun the process of negotiating with the WB and ADB at least $800 million in funds for the COVID-19 vaccination program through a project loan, with the DOH as implementing agency.\n",
      "The financing support from the ADB and the WB carries low interest rates, with an average maturity period of at least 1o years, Joven said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "(Go Negosyo / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Those who signed Wave 2 of “A dose of Hope” were Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines Inc. country president Lotis Ramin, Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, and Ambassador Daniel Pruce of the British Embassy.Concepcion said the 17 million doses summed up the private sector donations from Wave 1 with 35 companies, and 300 donor firms for Wave 2.\n",
      "Based on the agreement, 50 percent of the donated vaccines will be given to the donors for their own employees and 50 percent will go to the government through the Department of Health, which will allocate these vaccines to identified sectors.\n",
      "For the second wave of the “A Dose of Hope” project, the same tripartite model was adopted as vaccine procurement is still under Emergency Use Authorization – an authorization issued for unregistered drugs and vaccines in a public health emergency.\n",
      "Under this situation, only the government is allowed to deal and procure vaccines from various vaccine makers.“I like to thank first Secretary Charlie Galvez. Without your support, this tripartite agreement would have not been possible. Also, I like to thank the CEO of AstraZeneca, Lotis Ramin. Without your doses, we will not be here today to sign the agreement. We admire your company and your patriotism. These vaccines are really the way forward in helping our Filipino save lives and livelihood. Ambassador Pruce for all your efforts in forging this partnership and helping the negotiations move forward. And the private sector, our donors. The first batch was about 35 of the conglomerates who supported the program, and in the second batch, around 300 companies supported the program. And of course, our LGUs, who are now part of the Dose of Hope, 39 of them,” Concepcion said.\n",
      "Concepcion also hinted of a Wave 3 of the “A Dose of Hope” donation drive, stating they are talking with another provider although he did not discount another collaboration with AstraZeneca, citing the patriotism of its country head Lotis Ramin.\n",
      "“There is still a long list of private sector wanting to purchase vaccines,” he said.Galvez explained that the government cannot delegate the responsibility of importing the vaccines to anybody else because there are still ongoing trials.\n",
      "“All emergency use should be controlled by the government,” he stressed.\n",
      "“We cannot commercialize the procurement of vaccines,” he said adding that no vaccine company will sell to different companies but to the national governments only.\n",
      "Concepcion also supported Galvez, saying the private sector will abide with its agreement with the government for their respective roles.\n",
      "Galvez said that the government is targeting between 50 to 70 million people to be inoculated this year and another wave next year.Local chief executives from participating LGUs that procured vaccines from AstraZeneca also graced the the Wave 2 signing program.\n",

Eh ito na nga po ang katotohanan: Nakapasok na sa Pilipinas ang new variant ng COVID-19 (Why is it important for the vaccines to arrive in February, not June, when we expect the delivery of western vaccines? This is the truth: the new COVID-19 variant has entered the Philippines),” Roque said during a televised press briefing.“Sabi po ng dalubhasang Dr. Wong – ang prediksyon niya – itong bagong variant ay 56% more infectious than the ordinary COVID-19 strain. So kung ngayon po ay mayroon tayong 2,600 average na kaso ng COVID-19, ang 50% po, ibig sabihin niyan, kalahati ay madadagdag sa figure na iyan…Aabot po iyan ng mga 4,000 daily cases(According to Dr. Wong, his predictions is the new variant is 56 percent more infectious than the ordinary COVID-19 strain. If we now have 2,600 in average COVID-19 cases, it means it could reach 4,000 daily cases),” he said.\n",
      "“Eh kung imu-multiply din po iyan sa isang buwan, napakalaking numero po iyan (If we multiply that number in a month, that is a huge number),” he said.\n",
      "After enforcing travel restrictions on several countries affected by the dreaded illness, the Philippines recently reported its first case of the new coronavirus strain that emerged in the United Kingdom. A passenger who arrived from the United Arab Emirates tested positive for the new COVID variant and is now under quarantine.So far, Roque said the health department has not reported any local transmission of the new COVID variant the country.President Duterte earlier raised concern about the arrival of the new COVID strain in the country, describing it as the “new monster.” Duterte said he was praying that the new variant would not be more dangerous and toxic than its predecessor.\n",
      "Faced with the new coronavirus threat, Roque has defended the government’s purchase of 25 million coronavirus vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac BioTech, insisting its safety and efficacy.He said the initial shipment of the 50,000 vaccines, which he claimed government bought at a cost befitting a close friend of China, will arrive next month. The rest of the vaccines will be delivered in the succeeding months until December 2021.“Bakit tayo tatanggi sa limang milyon na Sinovac na mga bakuna na pupuwedeng labanan pati po itong mas nakakahawa na bagong virus strain ng COVID-19 (So why would we reject 5 million Sinovac vaccines that can fight this more infectious new virus strain of COVID-19?),” he asked.\n",
      "The country has logged nearly half a million cases of coronavirus since it was first detected early this year. More than 9,000 people died due to the illness in the country.\n",
      "To help fight the pandemic, the government has scaled up the acquisition of vaccines from manufacturers abroad. Among the initial supplies would come from Serum Institute of India, Sinovac, and AstraZeneca. More supply deals with other vaccine makers are being finalized by the government.

      "“Yesterday afternoon, Sinovac from China submitted an application. They are undergoing pre-assessment now,” said FDA Director General Rolando Enrique Domingo.\n",
      "Domingo said that the Chinese company still needs to submit more data about their vaccine. He said that Sinovac has so far submitted the results of their Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.“We will have to ask for their Clinical Trial Phase 3 report, which I believe they are collating and consolidating. Until we see them, we cannot assess it fully as the EUA is anchored on the Phase 3 results,” said Domingo.\n",
      "“We will have to wait for the Phase 3 clinical trial results because that would be the main part that we will be evaluating before actual evaluation starts,” he added.\n",
      "Sinovac Biotech is the fourth vaccine developer that submitted an application for an EUA in the Philippines for COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Domingo said it is unsure if Sinovac can secure an approval by February as projected by vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez. “It really depends on how quickly they submit the data that we want, and how convincing the data is,” Domingo said.Meanwhile, Domingo said that they are still evaluating the applications of United Kingdom-based firm AstraZeneca and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute.\n",
      "So far, American drug-maker Pfizer was the first to secure an EUA approval from the FDA.\n",
      "“We have pending applications.

      "In an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel, he maintained their appeal for transparency in the government’s negotiations for the acquisition of coronavirus vaccines.The chamber’s Committee of the Whole is set to continue Fridayits inquiry on the government’s inoculation program.“We’re going to…an executive session so that they don’t of course violate their non-disclosure agreement. We will ask them to disclose the prices of their purchase of the vaccines, ‘yung amounts na babayaran (the amounts to be paid), for transparency,” Zubiri said.The Senate leader said the Executive department cannot always invoke its non-disclosure deals with the vaccine manufacturers especially it concerns the use of public funds.\n",
      "“To us, ‘yung (the) non-disclosure agreements cannot be used for government funds because we have to properly account it. Importante po ito (This is important). That is the key to transparency,” he said.“Hindi naman puwede nating sabihin na: ‘Ah, huwag kayong mag-aalala, kami na ang bahala dito, kami ang may alam ng presyo, pero huwag kayong magalala, hindi tayo dehado.’ Hindi po puwede ang ganon sa gobyerno, dahil may CoA po tayo,” he added.(We cannot just say: ‘Don’t worry, we will handle this, we know the prices, but don’t worry, we will not be on the losing end.’ We can’t allow that in government, because we have a Commission on Audit)The government has already bought some 25 million COVID vaccines from Sinovac, with an initial 50,000 doses to arrive in the country next month.\n",
      "Zubiri said he finds the deal “worrisome” as he echoed concerns on the “low” efficacy of the Chinese drugmaker’s product.International reports said Sinovac’s vaccine was only about 50.4 percent effective in preventing coronavirus infection in a late-stage clinical trial in Brazil.Still, officials in the Eexecutive department defended it, insisting that the Chinese government has even offered the Philippines the “best price” for its purchase.“It’s also a matter of trust.

We want to make sure that people will satisfied and will be given at least a measure of trust that these vaccines are effective,” he said.“But in (all) fairness, I trust Sec. (Carlito) Galvez, he’s a good man. I’m glad he’s on top of the vaccine situation. Ang request lang namin (Our only request) is let’s be transparent about it,” he appealed.

      "Ponce made the comment in a speech at the inaugural session of the 11th Sangguniang Bayan of Pateros where he said the municipal government will purchase P20 million worth of COVID-19 vaccine for Pateros residents.“Majority of the local governments in the National Capital Region have placed their orders and we, too, in the Municipality of Pateros have earmarked the amount of P20 million for the purchase of this vaccine but we would like to proceed with caution for several reasons,” he said.“First, we cannot force this vaccine on our people. We therefore need to know the percentage of our population that needs to be inoculated so as not to waste any vaccine purchase from our own funds,” Ponce said\n",
      "Ponce added, “Our national government and local governments, particularly in the National Capital Region, have their eyes set on the vaccine that seems to be the only hope to get out of this chain of the pandemic that continuously enslaves us.”\n",
      "The national government, he said, should be part of the education campaign to raise awareness on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.“I also believe that most people would wait that this vaccine (be) started administering in other people in other parts of this country and see that they are effective and safe before they give their ‘yes’ to this vaccine,” the mayor said.\n",
      "The Pateros municipal government has started registering people who want to be vaccinated through three methods: submitting online form, QR code, and getting forms from health centers.He later told Teleradyo radio program that the P20 million budget will target to vaccinate 50,000 out of 80,000 residents.

      "This development came after Leonardia signed a deal with the Oxford-British firm last week, allocating P300 million for the procurement of COVID vaccines.\n",
      "“This is a giant leap towards realizing our vaccination goals,” the mayor said.Leonardia said that this means that a very substantial number of the population can be vaccinated as soon as the product becomes available in the country.\n",
      "He admitted that he was excited to make the announcement after getting AstraZeneca’s consent due to the confidentiality clause in the agreement.\n",
      "The city government of Bacolod signed a multilateral agreement with AstraZeneca and national government agencies, and a confidentiality agreement with AstraZeneca here on January 7.\n",

      "The city continues to record a decreasing trend in the number of COVID-19 positive cases based on the data of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC)- Task Force.\n",

      "“We have consistently maintained our fresh cases to a single digit and we have also maintained our testing average of 160 to 200, and sometimes 200 to 300 per day when there are no holidays,” said EOC deputy for medical and data assessment Dr. Chris Sorongon.This is to dispel rumors that our COVID-19 cases dropped because we did not perform testing, he added.\n",
      "Sorongon reminded the public to always observe minimum health protocols, such as the wearing of face masks and face shields, frequent washing of hands, and observance of physical distancing.“Let’s not be complacent and let’s always be responsible,” he said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Sen. Joel Villanueva on Wednesday called on the intergency task force handling the COVID-19 pandemic to start coming up with a “clear-cut” masterlist of the beneficiaries of the governement’s COVID-19 immunization program.\n",
      "Sen. Joel Villanueva\n",
      "(Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Villanueva said this would prevent any problems in the selection of those who who will be in the priority list for the inoculaton given the limited supplies of the coronavirus vaccines.\n",
      "“The IATF (Interagency Task Force on the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases) should start drawing up guidelines as early as now so that we can maximize the distribution of the vaccines given the limited supply. A person could easily fall under two and more categories, so there must be a clear set of guidelines on this,” he said in hs statement.“We do not want overlaps in the priority list. Given the limited supply, we must ensure that each dose goes to the rightful beneficiary,” he reiterated.\n",
      "The government plans to begin the immunization program in late February, with the aim of vaccinating 50 million of 70 million Filipinos within this year.\n",
      "Its initial priority list was comprised of frontline health workers, indigent elderly and other remaining senior citizens, remaining indigent Filipinos (12.9 million), and uniformed personnel.\n",
      "The IATF later expanded its target beneficiaries to include essential workers, such as those in transportation, public utility, seafarers and overseas Filipino workers.Villanueva said the IATF would have to identify that additional beneficiaries as he noted that about 25 percent or about 10 million of the country’s 39.8 million employed workers were identified in the October, 2020 Labor Force Survey as being part of “elementary occupations.”\n",
      "The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) says they are those involved in unskilled labor such as “street vendors, cleaners, domestic helpers and farm hands.”\n",
      "PSA data also shows that about seven million workers are in sales or service occupations.“While unemployment eased in October to 8.7 percent or about 3.8 million jobless workers, we must understand that the people also stopped looking for work. The slump is getting into the heads of our workers, and the vaccination program will help boost both the confidence of workers and our businesses as well,” said Villanueva, who chairs the Senate labor committee.\n",
      "“We cannot afford to drop the ball on this. The stakes are too high. Our country’s economic recovery depends largely on this,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Stressing the need for a swift and efficient whole-of-nation approach in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, opposition Sen. Francis “Kiko” N. Pangilinan said Wednesday that the key solution to a more efficient vaccine roll-out is to involve the local government units (LGUs) and the private sector to enable the Philippines reach inoculation targets.\n",
      "Senator Francis Pangilinan (Photo from Kiko Pangilinan website / kikopangilinan.com / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“Bakit ayaw nilang bigyan ng authority ang private sector at LGU (local government unit) na bumili ng vaccine at magkaroon ng mas efficient at mas masigasig na vaccine roll-out? I think that is a key solution. If we will just let the Department of Health (DoH) bureaucracy be the primary and sole vaccine roll-out bureaucracy, I doubt that we will be able to reach our targets,” Pangilinan said. (Why does the government refuse to give the private sector and the LGUs authority to buy vaccines for an efficient and efficient vaccine roll-out?)\n",
      "In a media interview, Pangilinan, who is the main proponent to convene the Senate Committee of the Whole (COW) to probe the country’s vaccine roll-out program, stressed that the bureaucracy needs a sense of urgency to be able to effectively deliver.“Kung aasa lang si (if we rely) on Galvez on DoH bureaucracy, he might as well be a general without an army…I have no doubt Gen. Galvez has what it takes to make this work, but he needs the DoH (to have his) sense of urgency. The lack of sense of urgency is clearly displayed in the last 11 months,” Pangilinan said, referring to Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., who is pandemic national action plan chief implementer and the so-called vaccine czar.\n",
      "“How do you get the bureaucracy to have a sense of urgency? You get the LGUs involved, you get the private sector involved. Let the LGUs and the private sector be the gas pedal to the roll-out,” he added.\n",
      "Pangilinan, who was Presidential Assistant on Food Security and Agriculture Modernization during the Aquino administration, said that at the time he was able to tap the bureaucracy under his command – the National Food Authority (NFA) and the Philippine Coconut Authority – when he needed to address the issues of fake plastic rice and “cocolisap” or coconut infestation.\n",
      "He said that absent this bureaucracy in Galvez’s Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), stakeholders with organizations on the ground should be tapped.“You have to infuse the bureaucracy with the new blood, different and fresh pillars. That would be the LGUs who have shown their response to be very relevant in many of these different localities, as well as the private sector,” Pangilinan said.\n",
      "Asked about how the Senate would be able to help allow the LGUs to directly purchase the vaccines, the senator said that it could be done by ensuring proper safeguards.\n",
      "“Provided that there are enough safeguards in terms of coordination, reporting. For example, the government could focus on the 24.6 million most vulnerable, then the remaining 50 million puwedeng private sector and the LGUs. It’s a matter of being able to orchestrate things properly. And that requires matinding timon (efficient helmsman),” Pangilinan said.He said the DOH could enable these stakeholders by deputizing the LGUs and the private sector.\n",
      "“In the end, it’s really the DoH’s call. Kasi sabi nga nila they can deputize. Ibig sabihin, it’s now up to the DoH to let go of some of its powers and enable the stakeholders. Enable the local governments. Enable the private sector. And get more involved in the roll-out,” Pangilinan said.\n",
      "“This is a mass vaccination. DoH and the government cannot do it alone. Again, you have to have LGUs involved. You have to have private sectors involved,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The government has so far secured millions of supplies from vaccine makers Covovax, Sinovac, and AstraZeneca, that are expected to be delivered to the county this year. Frontline health workers, seniors, poor citizens, and uniformed personnel will be among the priority beneficiaries of the government’s free COVID-19 vaccines.“Hindi po, dahil na-explain na ito ng FDA head natin, si Director General Domingo, na these vaccines because of the novelty ‘no, itong bagong bakuna na ito, mga bakuna that’s available, they apply for emergency use application dito sa bansa. And an EUA is actually not for commercial purposes (No, FDA head director general (Eric) Domingo has explained these vaccines, because of the novelty of these vaccines available, they apply for emergency use application in the country and an EUA is actually not for commercial purposes),” Nograles said during a televised press briefing Tuesday, when asked if the vaccines will be available in the market this year.\n",
      "Given the limited vaccine supply that will be for emergency use, Nograles explained that any acquisition will go through the national government. He said local government units and the private sector could forge supply deals with the manufacturers but under a tripartite arrangement with the national government\n",
      "“When the LGUs speak to the pharmaceutical companies, it’s also through a tripartite agreement with the national government na kasama doon sa tripartite agreement na iyan only because the unique characteristics of the vaccines that are available specifically for COVID-19 is an EUA application not just in the Philippines but in the entire world,” he said.\n",
      "“Lahat ng binibigay ng mga FDA ng iba’t ibang mga bansa is EUA (The FDAs in other countries give only EUA) and by the nature of the emergency use application, it is only through the national government. Why? Because, again, there is a limited number of vaccines available,” he added.Nograles said around 70 million Filipinos could be vaccinated under the programs initiated by the national government, local government, and the private sector. At least 75 billion will be set aside by the national government for the acquisition of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Of the 25 million COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinovac, an initial 50,000 doses will be shipped to the country next month. The remaining supply will be delivered in the following months.\n",
      "Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Gamaleya have pending applications for EUA before the local drug regulators. Once the EUA is granted, the government can start to administer the drugs for its massive immunization drive. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Senator Grace Poe on Tuesday slammed as “outrageous” the signing of an agreement between the Philippine government and Chinese drugmaker Sinovac for 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of its product.\n",
      "Senator Grace Poe (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "A day after the Senate Committee of the Whole’s first hearing on the government’s immunization plans, Poe said “questions still linger in the people’s minds as to why the government sealed an agreement with Sinovac when it’s not FDA-approved.”\n",
      "“We recall earlier pronouncements that government is not entering an agreement with Pfizer or AstraZeneca because tests have yet to be conducted or concluded,” she said in a statement.“This is outrageous. Why is Sinovac being favored when it only has 50-percent efficacy and the least transparency?Who are they trying to favor or appease?” she lamented.\n",
      "Senator Leila de Lima also said: “If Sinovac is so good, how come no private companies or LGUs purchased it for their people? Even Davao City got AstraZeneca.”\n",
      "Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced during his briefing Monday that the government has secured 25 million doses of vaccines from Sinovac Biotech, which reportedly committed to deliver an initial 50,000 in February.\n",
      "During the Senate inquiry, Senate President Vicente Sotto and Senator Panfilo Lacson, however, asked why the government concluded a contract with Sinovac although the FDA has not yet issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for its vaccines.National Task Force against COVID-19 chief and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. explained that the agreement was only a “term sheet” so the country could “lock in” supply logististics from the vaccine maker.\n",
      "“There is still a very rigorous supply agreement that will be tackled in order to determine the term of payments and also the terms of delivery,” Galvez said, explaining that it was “the model of advanced market commitment” that they are following.\n",
      "Sinovac has yet to apply for an EUA pending the results of its clinical trials in Brazil and Turkey, according FDA director general Eric Domingo.“Not even an EUA, they have not applied and yet to concluded a contract to deliver 25 million doses…Why would you even negotiate with them? When several others have already applied and their EUAs are forthcoming?” Lacson pressed.\n",
      "“Why would you give preference to a brand that has not even applied for EUA?”\n",
      "Galvez, in response, said this is to prevent the country from being “at the tail end of the supply chain” for COVID-19 vaccines. “There is some sort of competition,” he said.\n",
      "He said Sinovac will not deliver the vaccines next month “if the EUA [application] is not approved.” He further clarified: “The delivery will be delayed until the EUA is approved.”\n",
      "In the same hearing, Galvez said the majority of the vaccines secured by the Philippines will come from the United States, the United Kingdom and India, followed by China and Russia.A bulk of these will be supplied by US pharmaceutical firm Novavax, which committed to deliver 30 million to 40 million doses to the country, he said.\n",
      "Reports said that the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinovac showed a general efficacy of less than 60 percent in its clinical trial in Brazil, although Sau Paulo’s Butantan biomedical center dismissed these as “purely speculative”. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“The government’s priority right now should be having as many Filipinos as possible vaccinated in order to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, get the economy on the road to recovery, and return the nation to pre-2020 normality,” said Rodriguez, who filed House Resolution (HR) No.1460 for the purpose of his appeal.He said LGUs throughout the country should be allowed to import vaccines for their constituents since the national government can only answer for the vaccination of 30 to 50 percent of the country’s population.\n",
      "Rodriguez said that over 30 provinces and cities have already allocated funds for anti-COVID shots approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with the cities of Makati, Quezon City, and Taguig setting aside P1 billion each from their local budget.\n",
      "He added that even small provinces like Biliran and Eastern Samar are raring to procure vaccines with allocations of P100 million and P500 million, respectively.\n",
      "The Mindanao lawmaker had earlier filed HR No.1453 prodding the government to let private businesses procure COVID-19 vaccines for their employees and their families.He said allowing LGUs and private companies to buy their own vaccine will greatly help the national government in achieving its goal of herd immunity from COVID-19, which calls for inoculating at least 80 percent of the population.\n",
      "Rodriguez has also filed a bill to exempt vaccine importation from duties, taxes, and other fees.\n",

      "Due to stumbling blocks, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon believes that the government’s target of securing 148 million doses of vaccines to inoculate 70 million Filipinos against COVID-19 by the end of 2021 will be difficult to achieve.\n",
      "Senator Franklin Drilon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Drilon said the government’s COVID-19 vaccination plan “is good on paper” but “the plan is filled with uncertainties and it leaves too much to chance.”\n",
      "“Parang suntok sa buwan ang vaccination program lalo na yung sinasabi nila na 148 million doses within the year,” Drilon said in a statement on Tuesday, a day after the Senate Committee of the Whole conducted an inquiry on the status of the national government’s COVID-19 vaccination plan.“The arrival of the vaccines is not even definite. How can they say that they will be able to purchase 148 million doses by the end of 2021 when up to now, we haven’t given any Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to any vaccine and we have not been able to raise, through loans, all the needed amount for the purchase of the vaccines?” Drilon said.\n",
      "The minority leader also said he is skeptical over the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) assurance that it is ready to issue an EUA within the week for Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "FDA Director General Eric Domingo, during the hearing, said Pfizer has applied for an EUA and the agency is expected to issue one in one to two days.\n",
      "“I am not reassured in the slightest by what I heard. To be honest, I am more confused now. The government’s COVID-19 vaccination plan fails to provide the public the assurance they need from the government,” Drilon said.\n",
      "He said vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr.’s statement that 80 percent of the global supply has already been procured by rich countries makes the government’s target of securing millions of doses simply difficult to achieve.\n",
      "“If only the government was able to make advanced purchases last year, similar to other low-and-middle income countries such as Indonesia and Brazil, maybe we would have a better chance of securing these 148 million doses of vaccines this year,” he added.\n",
      "Drilon said the only way the government can achieve its target of inoculating 70 million Filipinos is by allowing the local government units (LGUs) and the private sector to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies for the purchase of the vaccines that they had issued an EUA to.He said this would expedite the purchase of the much-needed vaccines. “I believe there is a consensus among the senators insofar as lifting these restrictions is concerned,” he said.\n",
      "“They have a better chance of achieving the targets if they lift the restriction that they set that prevents local chief executives and the private sector from buying vaccines directly from the manufacturers,” the senator said.\n",
      "The Senate minority chief also said that funding for the procurement of vaccines is not even guaranteed at this point as the government has not fully secured the necessary loans to fund the P70-billion.\n",
      "The government has allotted P82.5-billion for the purchase of the vaccines but only P12.5-billion is in the programmed appropriation. At least P2.5-billion will come from the 2021 General Appropriations Act (GAA) and another P10-billion under the extended Bayanihan to Recover As One Act or Bayanihan 2.

      "Senators on Monday asserted that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should allow the private sector and local government units (LGUs) to procure COVID-19 vaccines directly from vaccine manufacturers.(Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "This would help the government in its efforts to combat the pandemic and restore economic activity faster.\n",
      "Senate President Vicente Sotto III, Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto and Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said it is imperative that the FDA consider this and remove from the government the monopoly of purchasing the COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“Bakit ang national government gusto i-monopolize ang pag-purchase (Why does the national government want to monopolize the purchase? Bakit di na lang payagan yung (Why not allow the) LGUs at private sector to do their own purchases?” Recto said during the Senate Committee of the Whole’s inquiry into the status of the government’s COVID-19 vaccination program.\n",
      "“I understand that the COVAX facility would be cheaper, but if this is a whole-of-nation approach, payagan na rin yung private sector. Kung willing sila magbayad ng mas mahal, na iba ang presyo sa COVAX facility—yan yung national government—tapos pribado, (f they are willing to pay a higher price, different from the price offered by the COVAX facility—which will be done by the national government—then the private (sector), they can have their own importation or the LGUs for that matter,” he said.\n",
      "“Bakit di na lang payagan ng FDA yan or ng national government? (Why can’t the FDA or national government allow it?)” Recto further pointed out.\n",
      "Drilon agreed with Recto saying he cannot understand why the government would authorize the use of about 70 million Filipinos using the COVID-19 vaccines to be procured by the state through an emergency use authorization (EUA) with FDA and yet refuse to apply the same process to the private sector and the LGUs.\n",
      "“The premise…is that at least the EUA is a prima facie certification that the vaccine is safe and effective. In fact, it is because of that EUA that we would authorize the use of about 70 million Filipinos because there is prima facie finding that it is safe and effective. Why can’t this prima facie finding to be made to apply to the private sector and the LGUs and allow them to acquire these vaccines also in the same basis of a EUA so that the national government can be assisted in acquiring these vaccines and make it available to our people,” Drilon pointed out.\n",
      "“The issue here is why is it that the national government would want to impose this rule of an EUA that would give birth to a monopoly, which is not good as a matter of policy,” the minority leader stressed.\n",
      "FDA director general Rolando Enrique Domingo, however, said it is important that the procurement of the vaccines must go through the national government because the products would only be issued with EUA for local distribution in the Philippines.\n",
      "“It takes about seven years to procure a vaccine and they can only apply for a certificate of product registration or marketing authorization once that these three trials are completed,” Domingo explained.\n",
      "Domingo further said that vaccine manufacturers would not take responsibility for their products, while the national government will take responsibility for using a product that is still under development.\n",
      "“Naniniwala naman po kami na kailangan naman po talaga ng LGUs at ng private sector (ng mga vaccines) kaya nga po ginawan natin ng paraan para sila maka-access sa through DOH (Department of Health),” Domingo said.\n",
      "“Kasi yung mga kumpanya po talagang malalaki ay hindi po talaga magbebenta sa mga LGU at mga private company. Kasi yun pong kanilang produkto under development pa at hindi pa sila ready na i-market ito, ” he reiterated.\n",
      "But senators pointed out that some LGUs have already procured COVID-19 vaccines for their respective constituents due to the government’s slow procurement process.\n",
      "Sotto and Sen. Risa Hontiveros cited the case of the Makati City Government which has already secured 1 million doses of vaccines from AstraZeneca for its citizens.\n",
      "Sen. Cynthia Villar agreed with Drilon and Recto’s position saying the government should not wait for the country’s economy to collapse before allowing the LGUs and the private sector to acquire COVID-19 vaccines based on their own efforts.\n",
      "“Kasi kung iintayin pa natin yung third quarter… paano yung first and second quarter ng (Because if we’re going to wait for the third quarter, what happens to the Philippines during our first and second quarter) Pilipinas in terms of economic activity and employment? Patay na tayo,” Villar said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Kabayan party-list Rep. Ron Salo believes that the Philippine government should partner with different sectors in the procurement and distribution of anti-COVID vaccines for the daunting endeavor to be a success.\n",
      "Kabayan party-list Rep. Ron Salo\n",
      "(FACEBOOK / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“The sheer magnitude of this undertaking to inoculate all Filipinos in such a short span of time requires a whole of system and a whole of society approach. Neither the government nor the private sector can successfully undertake it alone,” Salo said Monday.\n",
      "The first order of business is to bring the foreigner-made vaccines to Philippine shores in the most efficient way possible, the solon said.“I think that procurement of COVID-19 vaccines should be undertaken by the government in partnership with international organizations such as the WHO (World Health Organization) and the UNICEF (United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund),” he said.\n",
      "“This will achieve at least two things: We will be able to benefit from decreased cost associated with bulk procurement, as well as benefit from the expertise and moral ascendancy of these specialized international organizations,” the former UP law professor noted.\n",
      "Salo said once the country secures its deals for vaccine supply, the challenge of storing and distributing the drug must then be addressed. And it’s no easy task given the nature of the vaccine, he said.\n",
      "“The storage, distribution, and administration of these vaccines to our people should be undertaken by the government in partnership with the private sector,” he said.American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which jointly developed an anti-COVID vaccine with German biotech firm BioNTech SE, said their particular vaccine must be kept at a temperature of negative 70 degrees Celsius for 10 days if unopened. This raises the need for local cold storage facilities to ensure that the procured antigen won’t go to waste.\n",
      "Incicentally, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is among the most promising and sought-after by countries due to its 95 percent efficacy rate claim.\n",
      "Pfizer has designed distribution containers that can be used for temporary storage in a vaccination facility, such as a hospital, for up to 30 days as long as they refilled with dry ice every five days. Once thawed, the vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator at two to eight degrees Celsius for up to five days.“We need to synergize the efforts, resources, and expertise of both the public and the private sectors to ensure the success of this massive undertaking,” Salo pointed out.

      "As the government steps up its vaccine acquisition efforts, presidential spokesman Harry Roque explained that beneficiaries could either accept or decline the vaccine offered by the government. A waiver of right will be signed by the beneficiary if he or she declines the free vaccine, he added.The issue on vaccine rights was recently discussed by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).\n",

      "If a beneficiary refuses to take the free vaccine, Roque said the person must sign a waiver that will renounce his or her priority status for free vaccination. He admitted that people could not afford to be picky when it comes to vaccines since many others want to get inoculated against the virus.\n",

Sasama ka doon sa the rest of taumbayan na nag-aantay ng bakuna (But you will sign a waiver that you will not be vaccinated. And once you decline, you will lose your priority status.

Totoo po, meron tayong lahat karapatan para sa mabuting kalusugan pero hindi pupuwede na pihikan dahil napakadaming Pilipino na dapat turukan (It is only right.

      "The government had earlier identified health frontliners, seniors, poor citizens, and uniformed personnel as among the priority sectors who will receive the free vaccines.“We can do what Indonesia did — accept the delivery and wait for the approval (by the) regulatory authority,” he said.\n",
      "Roque assured the public that the CoronaVac vaccines, a vaccine developed by China’s’ Sinovac Biotech, have been tested for safety and efficacy in clinical studies.\n",
      "He said Turkey, which ordered three million doses of Sinovac vaccine, attested that China’s vaccines are 91.25 percent effective and did not see any major side effect.\n",
      "Thailand has also acquired two million shots of China’s Sinovac while Indonesia has obtained 125.5 million doses.\n",
      "Indonesian studies also found Sinovac has 91.25 percent efficacy rate, Roque said.\n",
      "“The clinical trials done in West Java and Turkey show that Sinovac vaccines are safe and effective,” he said in Pilipino.\n",
      "Roque took a swipe at government critics who have voiced doubts about the government’s vaccination plan.\n",
      "“To the enemies of the government, be silent. It will blow up in your faces. When the survey results come in, you’ll perform badly, you’ll get zero, you’ll be a failure again,” he said in Pilipino.\n",
      "Choose one\n",
      "Roque said President Duterte may receive the Sinovac vaccine since it will be first to arrive in the country.\n",
      "The President is reportedly eager to get inoculated against the coronavirus using vaccines made by China and Russia but he would have to choose only one, according to Roque.\n",
      "“Si Presidente malinaw. Gusto niya magpaturok agad, gusto niya Tsino at Russian. Ang tinatanong niya kung puwede pareho. Ang tingin ko ‘hindi’ so kailangan mamili ang presidente kung Sino o Russian ang kanyang papaturok (The President is clear. He wanted to be vaccinated by the Chinese and Russian-made vaccines. He has been asking if it is possible to get the two vaccines. I think this is not possible. So the President has to choose between the vaccines made by China and Russia),” Roque added.\n",
      "Under the government’s free vaccination plan, frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens and other seniors, indigent population, and uniformed personnel will be the first to be inoculated against the virus.\n",
      "The priority areas for the immunization drive are the National Capital Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Region 11 (Davao region), and Region 4-A (Calabarzon).\n",
      "Roque said priority beneficiaries cannot choose the brand of life-saving drugs they want to receive or be forced to be vaccinated.\n",
      "They can either accept or decline the vaccine offered by the government. If a beneficiary refuses to take the free vaccine, Roque said the person will sign a waiver that will renounce his or her priority status for free vaccination.\n",
      "Many others want to get inoculated against the virus, he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez on Monday told the Senate Committee of the Whole that the bulk of the COVID19 vaccines that will be made available in the Philippines will come from US pharmaceutical company Novavax.\n",
      "Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the NTF Against COVID-19, signed a “term sheet” with the Serum Institute of India (SII) and its Philippine partner, Fabreco Life Sciences last Saturday, January 9, to nered with Novavax, a US-based biotechnology company to develop and commercialize the Covavax vaccine.\n",
      "(Joe Raedle/Getty Images / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“The vaccine has the recombinant coronavirus spike protein nanoparticle and a Novavax-patented Matrix-M adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Covovax is in third-stage trials and is expected to be approved for use by international regulators,” the NTF said.The Covovax vaccines are expected to arrive in the country in the third quarter of this year.\n",
      "“Our main volumes will be coming from Novavax with 30 to 40 million doses,” Galvez said during the hearing.\n",
      "“For Pfizer, we are negotiating for higher volumes of more or less 40 million; AstraZeneca 25 to 30 million doses, and Sinovac and Gamaleya for 25 million each,” he said.\n",
      "He said the government can start rolling out its COVID-19 vaccination program in February possibly using either Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, or the Sinovac from COVAX, the global facility vaccine procurement and distribution effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.He said the Philippines might be receiving more or less 40 million doses from COVAX for 20-30 million people.\n",
      "Galvez, however, said that 80 percent of the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines has gone to rich countries.\n",
      "“The reality is that more than 80 percent of global supply has already been pre-procured by rich countries,” Galvez said.“We are now trying our best to negotiate with different vaccine companies to get a fair share of the vaccines for the remaining 18 percent of the global supply,” he added.\n",
      "He said the government will proceed with the procurement of the vaccines using the budget appropriated under the national budget for 2021 and the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2), through bilateral financing or government to government financing, tripartite agreement, and multilateral arrangements with major financial institutions such as the World Bank (WB) and Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n",
      "Galvez also assured that the government will prioritize frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens, remaining senior citizens, remaining indigent population, uniformed personnel, teachers, social workers, overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), and other essential workers outside of the health, education, and social welfare sectors in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program.\n",
      "Covovax thoroughly evaluated Dr. Luningning Villa, medical director of the Faberco Life Sciences, said the Covovax vaccine was “thoroughly evaluated” in different geographies, various age groups, racial and ethnic minorities, and other groups that were most affected by COVID-19 including people living with HIV.\n",
      "“The vaccine will be used to vaccinate 15 million vulnerable and poor Filipinos. The vaccine is stable at 2°C to 8°C, the standard temperature that is within the existing cold chain system in the Philippines, thus allowing its distribution to the remotest barangays,” Villa said.She said that Covovax has undergone clinical trials involving a sizable population of around 50,000 subjects “to ensure extreme robust clinical data prior to approval by relevant regulatory bodies including the WHO.”\n",
      "The candidate vaccine underwent the initial phase of its clinical trials in Australia, South Africa, and India, Villa said. She added that a phase three clinical trial is also being carried out in the United Kingdom with 15,000 subjects; and in the United States and Mexico with 30,000 subjects, respectively.\n",

      "“However, we can only attain this objective only if we have a well-coordinated, fully-planned, and a systematic distribution of vaccine in the country,” he pointed out, saying the country should prevent a repeat of the “inadequate” handling of the COVID-19 pandemic that led to an outbreak and increase in cases last year.

      "With the vaccines for COVID-19 already available and in fact being rolled out in some countries, we in the city government are inviting all the residents of Manila to register for the free vaccination we intend to implement once the vaccines reach us.\n",
      "Since we launched the registration about a week ago via www.manilacovid19vaccine.com and invited the citizens of Manila to register, more than 55,000 have already heeded our call as of this writing.Through an ordinance earlier passed by the Manila City Council headed by Vice Mayor and Presiding Officer Honey Lacuna and Majority floorleader Joel Chua, we were able to allot initially P200 million which we now raised to P250 million, for the purchase of the vaccines. This would be on top of the vaccine allotment by the national government for the city of Manila and modesty aside, we are ready to increase the allocation to up to P1 billion if opportunity allows.\n",
      "Since the health of the city’s populace is our foremost concern, we ask for the indulgence and patience of residents if they do experience potholes on the streets.\n",
      "We in the city government have decided to cancel certain infrastructure projects and instead had the budget realigned for the city government’sCOVID vaccination program which is part of our working plan for the next six months.There is this need to sacrifice major infra projects to be able to respond to the primary needs of our citizens.\n",
      "Our gratitude goes to President Rodrigo Duterte and National Action Plan vs COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr. for all the support that Manila had been getting in the fight against COVID-19.We also thank and laud the President for having issued last December 1 Executive Order 121 which authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue emergency use authorization (EUA) to expected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) drugs and vaccines that will be made available in the Philippines.\n",
      "Following talks with Pfizer and AstraZeneca that began as early as July last year, we were able to enter into a non-disclosure agreement and succeeded in securing an initial 400,000 doses of vaccines,enough to cover 200,000 residents.\n",
      "As per guidance from the World Health Organization and the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), medical frontliners will be prioritized in the vaccine rollout, to be followed by senior citizens and finally, the general population of Manila.I am happy to announce that along with Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna and the Manila Health Department under Dr. Poks Pangan, among others, we have held meetings to polish the plans for the vaccination processes while completely following the mandated protocols.\n",
      "In urging Manilans to register for free vaccination slots, such will be on a voluntary basis only. All processes and vaccines that will be used will be in accordance with what is mandated by the regulatory agencies of the national government.\n",
      "While the vaccine is still on the way, free swab and serology testing will continue to be given in the various designated centers in the city. Thus, we urge those who feel they have been exposed to a virus carrier, are experiencing symptoms, or merely want to have peace of mind to take advantage of the COVID-19 tests being given by the city government free of charge.\n",
      "There is nothing to lose in submitting to these free COVID tests, for one’s very own safety and and those of their loved ones.Besides, certificates will be issued and these can be used by those who are returning to work and are being required to present a certificate stating that they have been swabbed and are found to be negative for COVID-19.\n",
      "Under the process, the person tested will have to stay at the quarantine facility while awaiting the result which is released within 24 hours. The facility, by the way, is equipped with airconditioning units, wifi and we even serve free food.We have 14 quarantine facilities in the city that are fully functional and ready to accept those who wish to get tested. Early detection is key to better chances at recovery and preventing community transmission.\n",
      "In the meantime, I am reiterating my previous and oft-repeated appeal to all my fellow Manilans to continue being alert and practicing minimum health protocols. And do register to get a slot in the upcoming vaccination.\n",
      "I don’t mind sounding like a broken record but let me stress, once again, thatCOVID-19 is still in our midst and in fact continues to claim precious lives.\n",

      "“Yes, nakuha natin ang idea sa (we got the idea from the) House of Representatives. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. Ginagawa na yan ng LGUs (the local government units are already doing it too),” Zubiri said in an interview over Radio DZRH.\n",

I made the suggestion to him that if ordinary companies are getting vaccines, why can’t we?),” he pointed out.\n",

      "Panelo has dispelled allegations about the government’s alleged slow procurement of vaccines, citing the early allocation of resources to obtain such supplies. The procurement of vaccines would be a “continuous effort” since it is essential to protect Filipinos from the coronavirus threat, he assured the public.\n",
      "“To this end, the government is exploring all possible avenues as well as partners, both international and domestic, to obtain the vaccines necessary for our citizens,” Panelo said in an interview with Manila Bulletin.“Our government cannot, by any means, be characterized as slow in securing vaccine doses. The vaccination of our people has been identified as the end goal from day one, and accordingly, manpower and resources werealready allocated for the accomplishment of the task,” he said.\n",
      "Vaccine procurement however won’t be a walk in the park. Panelo acknowledged there is a growing demand for the COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“Procurement of a finite supply that is so much in demand will be fraught with challenges,” he said.\n",
      "“Nevertheless, our government, through the leadership and direction of our vaccine czar, Secretary Charlie Galvez, is focused on his new task and will tirelessly see it through,” he said.Galvez earlier said the government aims to buy 148 million doses of coronavirus vaccines for an initial 50 to 70 million Filipinos this year. Negotiations are ongoing with vaccine makers like Novovax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Sinovac, and Gamaleya. Galvez said he hopes the supply deals could be finalized this month.

      "Apart from local governments willing to spend for vaccines, she also urged private companies to invest in vaccines to help the national government in its COVID-19 immunization campaign.\n",
      "Robredo noted the importance of the private sector’s contribution to the national vaccination program.The Philippine government recently signed an agreement with the private sector for the purchase of two million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.\n",
      "Half of the vaccines, which are expected to arrive later this year, will be donated to the government, while the other half will go to private sector employees.\n",
      "Still, the vice president made the call to private companies as more local government units (LGUs) nationwide have allocated funds to buy COVID-19 vaccines.“We also encourage companies that can spend for the vaccination of its own employees to invest,” she said in Filipino. “Because every company and LGU that would invest, it would help everyone.”\n",

      "DAVAO CITY – Vaccine-maker Astrazeneca Pharmaceuticals (Philippines), Inc. has committed to deliver an initial batch of its coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines to the city government of Davao by the third quarter of this year, Mayor Sara Duterte said on Friday.\n",
      "During her live program over Davao City Disaster Radio (DCDR 87.5), Duterte said that she had already signed the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the company on Thursday and met with its executives Friday.\n",
      "She said the local government will procure the AZD1222, the vaccine jointly developed by the British firm in collaboration with Oxford University, through the national government.She added that vaccines will be delivered in tranches since Astrazeneca could not supply it in bulk.\n",
      "Duterte said the local government is targeting to inoculate 1.2 million Dabawenyos to achieve herd immunity.\n",
      "The discussion between Duterte and Astrazeneca took place a day after the City Council of Davao approved an ordinance granting authority to the local chief executive to begin the transactions with Astrazeneca for a supply of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "She said the local government pursued discussion with the British drugmaker since it was the only firm ready to sign a contract with any local government unit (LGU).But she added that thelocal government will also negotiate with other vaccine-makers for additional supply of vaccines.\n",
      "She said she is set to meet with another vaccine-maker, also on Friday.\n",
      "She said the city’s supply of vaccines will augment the nationwide vaccination program, targeting the individuals who are not in the priority list of the national government.Based on the priority eligible groups of the national government, priority will be given to frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens, remaining senior citizens, remaining indigent population, and uniformed personnel.\n",
      "She said the local government did not set a ceiling on the budget for vaccines since it will also negotiate for more supply from other pharmaceuticals.\n",
      "“What we will do (is) we will talk to as many vaccine-makers as possible, especially those who have the intent to apply for EUA (emergency use authorization) or certificate of product registration in the Philippines, and ask them if they can deliver to us this number of doses and if they say yes, then, we will start the process of contracting with them,” she said.\n",
      "Duterte assured that the local government will procure available vaccines from different vaccine-makers.\n",
      "As of January 7, the Department of Health (DOH)-Davao Region recorded 13,321 total COVID-19 cases, with 1,707 active, 11,064 recoveries, and 550 deaths.Of the total cases, Davao City reported 9,325, Davao de Oro with 618, Davao del Norte with 1,684, Davao del Sur with 990, Davao Occidental with 131, and Davao Oriental with 573.

Joselito Bayatan, OIC- City Health Officer Dr. Edwin Miraflor Jr., and Emergency Operations Center deputies for medical Dr. Chris Sorongon and Dr. Hector Gayares at the Bacolod City Government Center Thursday.

      "This was announced by Mayor Evelio Leonardia at a press briefing here, following the ceremonial signing of a multilateral agreement with AstraZeneca and national government agencies, and a confidentiality agreement with AstraZeneca at the Bacolod City Government Center on Thursday.\n",
      "AstraZeneca is a multinational pharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, England, which has partnered with the University of Oxford in developing a vaccine against COVID-19.“It is our policy, our belief, and our commitment that when the health and lives of our people are at stake, we will go for broke,” Leonardia said.The mayor stressed that the city government was committed to providing its citizens with any duly approved vaccines that would be available in the market.\n",
      "This was the reason why city officials are making all necessary efforts to raise the needed budget, according to Leonardia.\n",
      "“We are willing to augment, to re-align, and to revert all items in our budget if the need arises,” Leonardia said, adding that they will be starting with the preparation of P300 million for the vaccines.\n",
      "“We will make adjustments if necessary,” he said.\n",
      "Leonardia was authorized by the City Council to contract with AstraZeneca to avail of the company’s vaccine in a special session held last Wednesday.\n",
      "Prior to that, officials of League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) headed by Leonardia as national president and the LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment, chaired by Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas, met with top officials of AstraZeneca in a virtual dialog.\n",
      "Taking this “major step” further, Leonardia also wrote the council on Thursday to give him continuing authorization to enter into contracts with other pharmaceutical companies legally operating in the Philippines which can provide COVID-19 vaccines duly approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n",
      "According to the mayor, he made the letter-request because time was essential in procuring the vaccine.“We are very serious. We have to move fast and act fast,” he stressed, adding that he will not allow the people of Bacolod to be left out come the time the vaccines are already available.\n",
      "Leonardia said that the City Health Office and the COVID-19 Vaccination (CoVac) Council have started drafting the list of persons who shall be vaccinated first in Bacolod.\n",
      "The list will be finalized in accordance with the guidelines set by the Department of Health and the National Inter-Agency Task Force Against COVID-19 for identifying the priority sectors in mass vaccination.Leonardia clarified that local government units (LGUs) cannot independently procure COVID-19 vaccines without clearance from the national government.In his letter to the SP, he said: “The availability of the COVID-19 vaccine is limited, and considering the massive nationwide demand for it, we are bound to encounter problems in its timely availment if we do not act now to ensure that we are on the list of LGUs which are ready to availof any vaccine supply that the national government shall be able to procure under existing policies and procedures, and subject to adjustments that the national government may eventually adopt thereon.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Sen. Francis Tolentino (Albert Calvelo/Senate PRIB)\n",
      "The chairman of the Senate Committee on Local Government welcomed President Duterte’s approval of a tripartite agreement among LGUs, the national government, and pharmaceutical companies for the procurement of coronavirus vaccines.\n",
      "“The proactive approach by LGUs should not only be lauded but actively encouraged. There is more than sufficient legal basis for LGUs to procure COVID-19 vaccines for their own constituents,” Tolentino said.Several LGUs in Metro Manila have launched initiatives and set aside funds for the purchase and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in their respective jurisdictions.\n",
      "Officials, however, said LGUs can only do the procurement through a tripartite agreement, since vaccine manufacturers deal with the national government, and only vaccines given the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may be purchased by the national government.\n",
      "The senator said that under the Local Government Code, the LGUs have devolved powers which include the authority to provide basic health services compliant with standards and criteria set by the Department of Health (DoH).\n",
      "“This devolution of power is consistent with the principle of decentralization and local autonomy enshrined in our Constitution, laws, and jurisprudence,” Tolentino said.“Hence, under the Local Government Code, municipalities and cities are mandated and empowered to deliver basic health services and facilities, such as implementation of programs and projects on communicable and non-communicable disease control services; access to secondary and tertiary health services; and purchase of necessary medicines, medical supplies, and equipment, including vaccines,” he added.\n",
      "Tolentino said Duterte’s Executive Order No. 121, which authorizes the FDA to issue EUA for COVID-19 drugs and vaccines, and the FDA’s Circular No. 2020-036 prescribing the guidelines for its implementation, also do not limit the procurement of vaccines to the national government.\n",
      "He likewise said that procurement laws allow LGUs to purchase “much-needed supplies during the pandemic, including vaccines, without having to go through the long process of a public bidding.”He said that under Republic Act No. 9184, or the Government Procurement Reform Act, procuring entities, such as LGUs, can engage in negotiated procurement in emergency cases, which cover “imminent danger to life or property during a state of calamity, or when time is of the essence arising from natural or man-made calamities or other causes where immediate action is necessary to prevent damage to or loss of life or property.”\n",
      "Tolentino said the LGUs should be given a greater role in the government’s vaccination program.\n",
      "Allowing them to purchase COVID-19 vaccines will make sure that all Filipinos, including those who are not among the national government’s priorities, are inoculated and in turn, achieve herd immunity against COVID-19.\n",
      "He said the mass vaccination program “will only be successful with the cooperation and active participation of LGUs.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "BACOLOD CITY – Mayor Evelio Leonardia has been authorized by the Sangguniang Panlungsod (SP) on Wednesday to contract with AstraZeneca to avail of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n",
      "Mayor Evelio Leonardia (GLAZYL MASCULINO / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "The SP has also authorized Leonardia to sign the Confidentiality Agreement between AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals (Philippines) and the City of Bacolod on the proposed business arrangements for the availability and distribution of the vaccine.\n",
      "AstraZeneca, a multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Cambridge, England, has partnered with the University of Oxford in developing a vaccine against COVID-19.Leonardia said the SP authority is a major step towards eventually availing of the vaccine for the people of Bacolod. He thanked the City Council for immediately granting his request for an authority to sign the non-disclosure agreement with AstraZeneca and the multilateral agreement between and among AstraZeneca, the national government through the National Task Force Against COVID-19, the Department of Health, and the City Government of Bacolod.\n",
      "“We have to get the vaccines as soon as possible, and even if we just start with AstraZeneca, we can now say that the process for getting it is rolling,” Leonardia said.\n",
      "The SP authority to contract with AstraZeneca came a day after the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP), headed by Leonardia as national president, and the LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment, chaired by Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas, met with top officials of AstraZeneca in a virtual dialog.\n",
      "Leonardia said the city government will coordinate with the LCP to hold exploratory talks with other pharmaceutical companies regarding the procurement of COVID vaccines.He revealed that the LCP officials and the LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment will hold a virtual dialog with Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., who is also the chief implementer of the National Task Force, and officials of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on January 12 to discuss and synchronize the ongoing efforts of the national government and those of the cities on the vaccine procurement.\n",
      "Based on the previous virtual meeting with Galvez last December 29, the national government is requesting that city governments allocate their funds first so that the national government can then efficiently and equitably distribute vaccines that it shall procure, with priority to be given to local government units (LGUs) with funding deficiencies and to areas where herd immunity is targeted.\n",
      "Leonardia said the LCP is collaborating with the DOH, the Department of Budget and Management, and the Department of the Interior and Local Government to arrive at a consensual decision on the procurement of the vaccines, which, as of now, can only be done at the level of the national government. \n",
      "Leonardia said LGUs cannot independently procure the vaccines without clearance from the national government.\n",
      "Galvez had earlier said the national government has earmarked P1.3 billion to buy at least 150 million vaccines for mass vaccination this year. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

Panaligan said the city is eyeing at least 50,000 people or at least one-third of the city population under the P25 million initial budget for the vaccines.“It is important that cities start the vaccination as early as possible to end the COVID-19 pandemic so that city residents can return to normal, revive the local economy, and resume the education of the youth that was disrupted by the long quarantine,” Panaligan said. He expressed his support to the proposal of the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) that city governments be allowed to procure their own vaccines.\n",
      "Panaligan said the LCP proposal has been approved by Malacanang but he stressed that LGUs will not be allowed to buy directly from the suppliers.Under a tripartite arrangement, it is the national government which has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to procure vaccines from manufacturers, the mayor said. Bacolod City Mayor Evelio Leonardia, LCP national president, has formed a committee chaired by Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Trenas to negotiate with the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), Food and Drug Administration, Department of Budget and Management, Department of Interior and Local Governments, Department of Health, and Vaccine Czar Gen. Carlito Galvez regarding their proposal. Panaligan, who is also the secretary-general of LCP, the national organization of cities in the country, said the purpose of LCP in coming up with this proposal is to ensure that cities can start the early vaccination of their constituents against thevirus now that there are already clinically tested and approved vaccines being administered in other countries.\n",

      "TACLOBAN CITY – After initially saying that the city government of Ormoc will be buying vaccines good for 30 to 40 percent of the city’s 240,000 residents with an estimated cost of P200-million, City Mayor Richard Gomez announced that the Ormoc City coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Vaccine Council (ORCOVAC) has decided to buy vaccines for at least 80 percent of the population.\n",
      "The ORCOVAC said the city government has enough money to buy more. “The vaccination program is our priority this year,” Mayor Gomez said.\n",
      "The Ormoc City COVID-19 Vaccine Council is a body created by Gomez on December 29, 2020, to study ways and means to implement the COVID-19 vaccination program. It is composed of top city officials and representatives of the private sector.Composing the task force are the mayor as chairman; Vice Mayor Leo Carmelo Locsin Jr. as vice chairman; Councilors Eusebio Gerardo Penserga, Peter Rodriguez, and Vincent Rama as members; and city health doctor Edmund Kierulf, city administrator Vincent Emnas, city legal officer Joy Mejia Romero, city budget officer Sabrina Duero, city treasurer Delia Vilbar, city accountant Rosario Serafica, city social welfare, and development officer Delia Corbo, city planning and development officer Raoul Cam, and infectious disease specialist Dr. Larsen Omolon, as members.\n",
      "From the private sector, Gomez has also included Ormoc Chamber president Stephanie Diane Chu and the chief of private hospitals namely Dr. Gardenia Larrazabal of Ormoc Doctors’ Hospital, Dr. Jaime Gatchalian Jr. of Clinica Gatchalian and Hospital, and, Dr. Sandra Fiel-Chiong of OSPA-Farmers’ Medical Center as members.\n",
      "Gomez said that some P350-million has been earmarked for the vaccination program. He said that he wants a 100 percent coverage, but added that the sum might just initially cover around 80 percent because “there will be other expenses like syringes, cotton, alcohol, storage, etc.”\n",
      "The council, however, will meet again to decide on which vaccine to buy.Gomez expressed hope that as more pharmaceuticals race to have their vaccines get emergency approval, the prices will go down. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The city government is also planning to vaccinate all its residents on a voluntary basis.\n",
      "In a post on her Facebook page, Mayor Ynares said the vaccines, which the city government ordered through the National Task Force Against COVID-19 and the Department of Health, will be arriving this year.Relly Bernardo, information officer of the city government told Manila Bulletin that the roll out for the vaccination program is targeted to happen in the third or fourth quarter this year.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the city government has also extended help to balikbayans (returning Filipinos from abroad) and the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) by welcoming them in the city’s 31 isolation facilities.\n",
      "To be accommodated for free with food and other hotel and dormitory provisions are returning Filipinos, city residents or not, from countries with travel restrictions because of the new coronavirus variant and required to undergo 14-day mandatory quarantine.\n",
      "Ynares also said that balikbayans and OFWs who will be tested positive but do not have symptoms or those with mild symptoms can stay in the city’s quarantine facilities until they finish their 14-day quarantine. Others who are waiting for the release of their swab test, especially those that will have to travel to far provinces and still preparing their travel pass and other necessary documents, can also stay at the comfort of the city’s air-conditioned facilities.Those who would like to avail the offer of the Antipolo City government can contact the Antipolo City Health Office at telephone number 8-697-0362, for the necessary arrangement that can be made. However, the requesting party should also inform the Bureau of Quarantine of his or her intention to be transferred to the Antipolo facility as the agency has jurisdiction over quarantine matters.\n",

      "The government should boost its information campaign about COVID-19 vaccines ahead of its expected arrival in the country this year to help build public trust in getting immunized and achieve herd immunity.\n",
      "This was the suggestion of OCTA Research Team fellow Dr. Guido David after a recent survey conducted by his group showed that only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents are willing to get immunized once vaccines against COVID-19 are already available in the country.\n",
      "Out of the 600 respondents in the capital region, David said that 28 percent are unwilling to get the vaccine while the majority or 47 percent are still uncertain whether to get the shot or not.“We think isang factor kung bakit may uncertainty is yung mga tao gusto nilang magkaroon ng information about the vaccine, although sinabi sa survey question na safe, they still want to know saan manggagaling, ano ang efficacy, ano ang mga side-effects,” David explained in an interview on Wednesday.\n",
      "(We think one factor why there is uncertainty is that the people want to have information about the vaccine, although the survey question said it is safe, they still want to know where it will come from, what is the efficacy, what are the side-effects.)\n",
      "According to David, the numbers of those who are willing to get vaccinated should increase to around 60 to 70 percent even in the National Capital Region (NCR) only which is still the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the county.\n",
      "David said information campaigns, as well as messages from the country’s leaders such as the Department of Health, will help in boosting these numbers and eventually reach herd immunity.Herd immunity, experts explained, is when it is less likely for citizens to contract the virus as the majority of the population will be protected.\n",
      "The University of the Philippines (UP) professor noted that information drives on COVID-19 vaccines will also help the government to build public trust which he said is also essential in encouraging the people to get immunized.\n",
      "“Possibly, kaya marami pa rin ang undecided ay dahil sa issue on Dengvaxia kung saan na-erode ng kaunti yung public trust to get a vaccine. That is why importante na marestore nag public trust,” David said.(It is possible that many are still undecided because of the issue on Dengvaxia which slightly eroded the public’s trust to get a vaccine. That is why it is important to restore public trust.)\n",
      "“Kaya important na ang government natin ay makapagsecure ng vaccine that is safe and mataas ang confidence ng mga tao dito para ma-maintain ang public trust sa gobyerno,” he added.\n",

      "National Task Force Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. recently said that COVID-19 vaccines will be made available in the country around March 2021 “at the earliest.”\n",
      "The government has formally secured more than two million doses of vaccines from AstraZeneca which is expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2021, while negotiations with other foreign vaccine manufacturers are still ongoing. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The logistics sector has urged the government to tap the private sector storage and logistics expertise because they have enough capacity to handle the different temperature requirements of COVID-19 vaccines if only government will give the business to industry players and not do it on their own.\n",
      "Michael Raeuber, chairman of the country’s largest integrated logistics firm Royal Cargo,lamented in an interview with Manila Bulletin Business that government is doing everything when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines, even the sourcing of transportation, setting aside the private sector’s expertise.\n",
      "Michael Raeuber, chairman of the country’s largest integrated logistics firm Royal Cargo.“Anytime,” said Raeuber when asked if Royal Cargo and other players can accept storage and handling of COVID-19 vaccines. The problem is, he said, the government has not tapped the private sector and has not organized the supply chain. “There is no such thing as of now. The way I see it is government is trying to control everything, including the sourcing of transportation, apparently there is no private sector participation, no jobs given to anybody, not to my knowledge,” Raeuber said.Pfizer requires minus 70 degrees Celsius, but Royal Cargo has storage capacity for minus 80 degrees. The company has also unlimited capacity for Astra, which has temperature storage requirement of 2-8 degrees. Royal Cargo has also roughly 200 reefer trucks with generator sets that can be mounted on these units to ensure that temperature can go down to as low as 35 degrees. “We could pack Moderna vaccines in these containers and bring them anywhere in the country even in areas with no electricity, the only thing you need is diesel,” he added.\n",
      "Royal Cargo’s P50 million cold storage capacity expansion at its main headquarters in Paranaque, just a walking distance from the international airport, is ongoing and is expected for completion in time for the arrival of the vaccines in this first quarter. (See related story: https://mb.com.ph/2021/01/02/royal-cargo-expands-facility-to-accommodate-vaccines/)\n",
      "According to Raeuber, Royal Cargo has rotating capacity to handle the vaccines because it does not mean that everything will have to come at one time. “Let’s just say that if government asks for 800,000 units for Metro Manila in one day, we can handle that and then replenish and open to receive more, but you see this supply chain has to be organized,” he said.\n",
      "Aside from Royal Cargo, he mentioned that pharmaceutical company Zuellig has also the capacity to handle COVID-19 vaccines, but it should be the government that should assign the task to the private sector.Raeuber noted that during a virtual vaccine debate, the government even erroneously stated that vaccines are only permitted or approved for emergency use, which means it is under full control of the government.“Number one, I don’t think that is correct because most of big vaccines have already been approved by many countries for use, not unrestricted use, not only for emergency use, and secondly, is government so effective that they can do all these by themselves,” he said.\n",
      "He said the government should find out what the private sector can do and, secondly seek partnership with the private sector.“Do not underestimate the power of capitalism and commerce,” Raeuber stressed as he pointed out the already established pharmaceutical distribution system by various pharmaceutical firms with their own representative companies in the country.\n",
      "“There is a complete private distribution system in the country already, tap this,” he urged noting that government doing it on their own is not efficient.\n",
      "Raeuber has called for urgency on the inoculation of the population because of the dangers of the new strain of the virus. “Imagine with this more dangerous variation of COVID coming here and catch us by surprise so we really really have to accelerate this vaccination as soon as possible to prevent something like that to happen,” he said citing resurgence of infections in the EU and the US.\n",
      "According to Raeuber the cost of COVID-19 vaccines varies. He said Moderna is between $25-35 while Pfizer is in the middle of $20-$15. Astra Zeneca is the cheapest at only $2.50 dollar, approximately P150 only, because it was developed by Oxford University and was given to Astra Zeneca, a British pharma company, on condition they have to keep the price down.

      "(ALI VICOY / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The latest decision was reached by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) during a meeting Tuesday as vaccine distribution has started in some countries.\n",
      "“Any individual arriving in the Philippines who may have received vaccination for COVID-19 in other countries/jurisdictions shall still be required to observe the mandatory testing and quarantine protocols,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque said on Wednesday.Local regulators have yet to give any emergency use approval to experimental coronavirus vaccines in the country although some public officials and military personnel have reportedly been inoculated.\n",
      "So far, American drugmaker Pfizer is the only vaccine company that has a pending emergency use authorization (EUA) application before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A decision on the application may be released next week.\n",
      "According to FDA director general Eric Domingo, United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca is expected to apply for EUA in the next few days.\n",
      "The World Health Organization recently issued its first emergency use approval for the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, which is reportedly 95 percent effective after two doses. The latest WHO actions sought to help countries without regulatory processes to gain access to the vaccine.Some potential coronavirus vaccines have also been given emergency use approval in countries like the United States and United Kingdom. Another vaccine, developed by Sinopharm, became the first to be given general use approval by China.\n",
      "The government has already allocated P72 billion for the acquisition and distribution of coronavirus vaccines under the 2021 national budget. Negotiations are underway to secure the country’s vaccine supply.\n",
      "President Duterte previously said the Philippines seemed to be playing “second fiddle” to the vaccine acquisition since it is not a rich country.Under the government’s vaccination plan, around 24.6 million Filipinos will be given priority in its free vaccination program to fight the new coronavirus disease. Health workers, senior citizens, poor citizens, and uniformed personnel will be prioritized in the immunization drive.\n",
      "The focused areas for the COVID vaccination campaign are the National Capital Region, Region 4A (CALABARZON), Region 3 (Central Luzon), Davao City, Cebu City, Cagayan de Oro, Baguio City, Bacolod, Iloilo, Zamboanga City, Tacloban City, General Santos City, and other affected places.\n",
      "Roque said the IATF called for the government’s intensified communication campaign on efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n",
      "Covered by the order are the Department of Health, Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Labor and Employment, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Information and Communications Technology, the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson, and the Presidential Communications Operations Office.\n",
      "These agencies have been asked “to further strengthen their enforcement, monitoring, and communication efforts or impose additional specific measures to mitigate the possible holiday surge of COVID-19 cases,” Roque said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque\n",
      "(OPS / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "According to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, acquiring the permit from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would help facilitate the vaccination of the rest of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) members.\n",
      "Dr. Rolando Enrique Domingo, FDA director general, earlier said the agency can issue compassionate permits for the use of COVID vaccines in the absence of an emergency use authorization (EUA). Such special permits can be issued to small groups such as the PSG, considering their mission to protect the President, according to Domingo.“If I were to be asked for an opinion ng PSG, I would seriously advice PSG na sundin iyong sinabi ni Usec. Domingo, mag-apply ng special permit nang sa ganoon maturukan iyong lahat ng miyembro ng PSG (to follow what Undersecretary Domingo said, to apply for a special permit so all members of the PSG can be vaccinated),” Roque said during a televised press briefing.During a meeting with top government officials in Davao City Monday night, the President asked Domingo if the FDA could issue emergency clearance for the use of COVID vaccines. He noted that only American drugmaker Pfizer has so far submitted its application for EUA of its vaccine in the country.Domingo, who attended the meeting via video conference, informed the President about the issuance of compassionate special permit for certain unregistered drugs. The official said this was the “safe way” to facilitate the vaccination even without the EUA.President Duterte has defended the PSG’s use of unregistered coronavirus vaccines, saying it was a matter of self-preservation. He also prohibited the PSG from appearing in a Senate inquiry to avoid getting “brutalized” in the hearing.Duterte has also denied he was trying to cover up the controversial vaccination of his security team. He claimed that he was unaware about the PSG vaccination, including the brand of the drugs administered to his security personnel.PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III earlier confirmed that several PSG close-in security members received the COVID vaccines to advance their mission to protect the President. The President was supposedly only informed about the PSG vaccination afterwards.The PSG vaccination drew criticisms from many groups who inquired about the source of the alleged smuggled vaccines.

      "(PIXABAY / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“Given recent developments, it does not look like we will see most students returning to their classrooms. Therefore, ALS modes will still be needed in school year 2021-2022,” Fortun said in a statement.\n",
      "“At best, the older students—those from Grade 9 to Grade 12 and those in college—would have the best chances of returning to classrooms if they are vaccinated within this year. According to the disclosures and data of the vaccine manufacturers, their vaccines are not yet recommended for children. The youngest ages they suggested for vaccination are in the 15 to 18 (age groups),” he noted.Fortun was a member of the House contingent in the Bicameral Conference Committee on the ALS Act, which was reported to have signed into law by President Duterte Monday. The law was designated as Republic Act (RA) 11510.\n",
      "“I thank President Rodrigo Duterte for signing into law these important reforms and milestone in alternative learning system. The law provides for bridging mechanism for ALS completers to higher education,” he said.\n",
      "He said the new ALS law gives the Department of Education (DepEd) strong legal basis to make all the needed changes to its delivery modes while online class continue under the new normal.\n",
      "Fortun said the ALS law had been pursued since the 15th Congress, but measures on it only prospered in the current 18th Congress after the COVID-19 pandemic made face-to-face classes for pupils untenable due to health risks.“Availment of the DepEd ALS or Alternative Learning System and lifelong education services is for free. The newly-signed ALS Law guarantees that all DepEd ALS programs are free and there shall be no solicitation or payments for any fees as a requisite for admission,” he explained.\n",
      "He said that while DepEd has been practicing ALS for decades, there has been a growing need to update the system via legislation.\n",
      "“Different ways of non-formal education shall be used to implement ALS, not just through online/ digital blended learning. The implementation modes depend on the situation of the learners. It is the DepEd that will adjust to the learner’s needs, not the learner adjusting to the DepEd,” Fortun said.The Philippines, unlike countries in the West, has yet to launch mass immunization efforts against the 2019 coronavirus.

      "Under Department Order No. 314, Guevarra told the NBI “to conduct an investigation on the reported importation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, administration, and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines that are not authorized by or registered with the Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines, and, if evidence warrants, to file the appropriate charges against all persons involved and found responsible for any unlawful act in connection therewith.”\n",
      "In the same order, the secretary also directed NBI Officer-In-Charge Director Eric Distor “to submit reports on the progress of the subject investigation directly to the Office of the Secretary within ten days and periodically thereafter.”Lavin believes that the President’s warning was only made against the plans to conduct congressional probes over the PSG’s use of the vaccine.\n",
      "“Tuloy ang sa amin (Our investigation will push through) unless that order of the secretary is withdrawn,” Lavin said.\n",
      "Lavin said NBI investigators will be reaching out to PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III “today or in the next few days maybe through the Armed Forces of the Philippines.”The spokesperson said Durante may come to the NBI, preferably with a lawyer, or send a lawyer instead.\n",
      "“If a lawyer submits an affidavit, a letter, then that would suffice,” he assured.\n",
      "On the other hand, if the AFP becomes uncooperative in the investigation, Lavin said the “we will build up the case on independent evidence.”\n",
      "Aside from the PSG, the spokesperson said the NBI will also investigate other reports of unauthorized use of COVID-19 vaccines including the revelation made by Chinese-Filipino civic leader Teresita Ang-See that there have been around 100,000 Chinese in the Philippines who received shots of the vaccines, particularly, those in the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operation (POGO) industry.\n",
      "“We also expect that we can reach out to Ms. Teresita Ang-See for her statement involving POGO quarters,” Lavin said.“Hopefully we can get enough information on that, their whereabouts, their identities, how it happened,” he added.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Lavin said Dongallo “already sent a communication to the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) requesting for a certification on whether there had already been vaccines which has been registered or whether there are vaccines submitted for registration and on what stage already are these vaccines on the registration process.”\n",
      "Also, the spokesperson said NBI investigators will also be reaching out to the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to determine “whether there had been importations or reported smuggling of vaccines.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

He recognized that it was a time for both the government and private sector to work together to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, which he claimed has produced “so much suffering” in the country.\n",
      "“The private sector has come through in a very big way with the call from the government and try to do everything that they could not only for their employees, their suppliers, but the public in general. I think we’re all here to help the country as a whole in the best way that we can,” he said.\n",
      "“And so never in the history, at least in my career, have I seen so much work taking place between the private sector and the public sector,” he said.He said they appreciate the government’s recognition of the contributions of the private sector in dealing with the pandemic. “That’s greatly appreciated. And this will, of course, continue into next year,” he said.\n",

At iyong requirement na iyan, kailangan ng FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approval,” she said on her Sunday radio show.(First of all, how did the vaccine enter the country?

So kailangan itong sagutin,” she stressed.(We have many agencies where it should have passed through. The Customs and DOH don’t know it. The FDA said it has not issued an emergency use authorization. So these should be answered.)The Vice President said the people does not deserve this kind of controversy at a time when the administration should build public trust and focus on securing the COVID-19 vaccines for those in its priority list for inoculations.President Duterte revealed that China’s Sinopharm vaccines have been given to some people in government.The Sinopharm is not in the initial list of vaccines that the Philippines is eyeing, among which are Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Moderna, and another Chinese vaccine Sinovac.Robredo questioned the role of regulations in the country if the government itself will let people, especially public officials, to have access to unauthorized vaccines.\n",
      "“If those close to the President were the ones who violated the existing protocols and the laws, this is not helpful. The rule whether it is donated or purchased, there are government agencies that need to approve it,” she said.Robredo added she agreed to the conduct of probe into the unauthorized distribution and administration of the COVID-19 vaccines for local use to hold those accountable.

      "The Senate Committee of the Whole is preparing for its initial public hearing on January 11 on the reported delays in the purchase and in the preparation for distribution of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines.\n",

      "Sotto said he advised Pangillnan’s staff to reduce the list of the two dozen resource persons to be invited to the Senate to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine issue.He saidall the 24 speakers could not possibly be asked to discuss the issues.\n",
      "This difficulty arises when each of the 23 senators, who will be physically or virtually present, would be given 10 minutes each to field their questions.\n",

We have plenty of time to go about it. Ilan uunahin, paano procedure, saan itatago. kasama sa 72.5-B na nilagay sa budget kasama rin kung saan itatago o itatabi (The hearing might take long as the purchase of vaccines has been delayed. Upon their arrival, the vaccines would be checked by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Will we determine who or what to take up first, what is the procedure, where to store them…Is the P72.5 billion in the budget withinreach),” he said.\n",

Drilon to call the commander of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) to the hearing could be taken up in later hearings as the controversial ‘’illegal, unauthorized’’ vaccination of some PSG members was not taken up during a Senate privilege speech.\n",
      "On complaints that the FDA takes too long to make recommendations on drugs it has inspected, Sotto replied: ‘’Napakatagal ng panahong tama ka. Napakatagal na, napakabagal, napakaraming ganun. Siguro meron naman magiisip na maiimbestiga tungkol dyan, ang daming reklamo, ang tagal daw.’’ Ilan ang nakapending sa FDA na mga gamot. (You are right, FDA takes too long, it is too slow. There are many similar instances. Maybe there are those who want the FDA investigated. There are many complaints. It is very slow. There are many drugs pending at FDA),” he said.‘’Yun ang imbestigahan ng DOJ (Department of Justice) bakit ang PSG ang iimbestigahan? ano ang nasa batas. Ano ang nasa batas wala, wala namang nakalagay sa batas na kapag uminom ka ng gamot na di registered sa FDA may kasalanan ka, wala. Walang batas against suicide kaya ano ang iimbestigahan ng DOJ, yung mga doktor na nagsaksak, eh paano kung di doktor, kung sila sila? (That is what the DOJ should investigate. Why probe the PSG? It is not in the law. There is nothing in the law that states that you are to be held liable if you drink a drug that is not FDA-registered. No violation. There is no law against those who commit suicide. The DOJ should investigate the doctor who made the injection. If there is no doctor, who are they),’’ he asked.\n",

      "“We’ll look at maraming possible violations from the Medical Practice Act to the tariff on the Customs Code of the Philippines, paano ito nakapasok (We’ll look at the many possible violations from the Medical Practice Act to the Customs Code),” he said.Lavin added there could also be violations with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), rules of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), and the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.\n",
      "“Hindi lang naman government officials and employees (Not only government officials and employees will be made accountable) but also private individuals who may have cooperated with the government employees or officials,” the NBI spokesperson said.\n",

      "Royal Cargo, Inc., the country’s leading integrated logistics provider, is expanding its pharmaceutical logistics services with the construction of new temperate controlled facility to ensure proper handling and storage of the critical COVID-19 vaccines into the country. Royal Cargo President Elmer Sarmiento told Business Bulletin they are investing at least P50 million for the construction of four new buildings at its Paranaque headquarters.Construction of the new facility is ongoing and is expected to be completed in February this year, just in time for the first quarter expected arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine into the country.\n",
      "“We are investing in a facility with low temperature unit for Pfizer vaccines but we have been in the business of pharma logistics long before so we are taking this opportunity of investing around P50 million. We are just adding four more because it is also expensive,” he said. According to Sarmiento, the temperate controlled facility would ensure they would meet the three types of storage requirements. These are the Plus 2-8 degrees Celsius, minus 20, and minus 70 degrees. Certain pharmaceutical firms that produce the COVID-19 vaccines require minus 70-degree storage facilities. Its expansion will be located inside its half a hectare main office in Paranaque, which is also ideal because it is just a kilometer away from the airport. This will serve as its pharma logistics hub as Royal Cargo is also engaged in providing storage and logistics for clinical trials and some other vaccines, and other high value medicines.“We have been into this business for quite some time, but with the COVID-19, we are growing this part of our business,” said Sarmiento, who said that pharma logistics is still a small portion of its total business. Earlier, Royal Cargo successfully cleared and delivered over one million vials of Penticiline vaccine within the required temperature of +2˚C to +8˚C without breaking the cold chain.\n",
      "The said vaccines were delivered for the Department ofHealth thru Medical Vaccine Online Deliveries which aims to address the common diseases for infants including Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hepatitis B and H, and Influenza type B.Royal Cargo’s Pharmaceutical Logistics unit provides logistics management solutions for pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries.\n",
      "Aside from the Paranaque headquarters, Royal Cargo has big facilities in Bulacan, Cavite and Laguna.\n",
      "Amb. Benedicto V. Yujuico, President of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI), the largest umbrella of business organizations in the country cited reports that the vaccines now in advance stages of development require meticulous handling and sub-zero cold chain infrastructure, which the country does not currently have.\n",
      "“There are no facilities in the country that can handle -80°C. The lowest temperature our cold storage facilities can go down to is -20°C to 25°C. The same is true for refrigerated trucks,” Yujuico said.\n",
      "Cold storage facilities and refrigerated trucks in the country meanwhile also handle mixed cargo – fish, meat, dairy, fruit and vegetables. There is the danger of contamination of the vaccines if co-stored in these facilities.“We need dedicated transport service and storage spaces to keep the integrity of the vaccines. These require massive investment and coordination, a herculean task that cannot be done by government alone,” Yujuico said.\n",
      "Expressing appreciation at the efforts of government to bring a vaccine to the country, Yujuico said PCCI is already consulting with industry players in the cold chain and supply chain businesses, transport (airfreight, shipping and trucking), and power generation, and is doing an inventory of existing facilities to step up the readiness of cold storage infrastructure and delivery logistics for the vaccine. PCCI is also consulting with its local chambers for possible vaccination centers where these facilities may be put up.\n",
      "PCCI said government’s partnership will entice private sector investment in the cold chain delivery system. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has vowed to investigate members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) for acquiring and using vaccines against the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n",
      "AFP spokesman Marin Maj. Gen Edgar Arevalo said in a statement that AFP chief-of-staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay has already “ordered the conduct of a thorough investigation on the factual circumstances surrounding this incident.”\n",
      "The move was made after PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III earlier bared that the PSG was able to get COVID-19 vaccines and have its personnel vaccinated.On the other hand, Arevalo reiterated that AFP believes that the move made by the PSG was necessary to prevent President Duterte from catching COVID-19.\n",
      "“We stand by the previous statement of PSG Commander BGen Jesus Durante that the President’s close-in security had themselves inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine to greatly reduce the possibility of being the source and carrier of this virus and consequently infect the President, whose good health and well-being are the PSG’s primordial concern,” Arevalo said.\n",
      "“However, we maintain our previous declaration that the Chief-of-Staff of the AFP was not part of or privy about the circumstances involving the procurement of these vaccines, its source, and the administration thereof to PSG troopers,” he assured.\n",
      "Under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 3720 or the amended Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, it is provided that any new drug “should have an authorization from the FDA based on an application containing full reports of investigations.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The Manila City government ushered in the New Year by launching a website where residents can pre-register to avail of the free coronavirus vaccine once it arrives and approved for use.\n",
      "In his message posted on the welcome page of the website, Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso urged Manila residents to pre-register to make the process to get free COVID-19 vaccines faster for everyone once it is available.\n",
      "Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso (Facebook / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "“Hinihikayat ko po kayo na lumahok sa pre-registration process na ating nilunsad ngayon upang mas mapabilis at mainam na proseso ng FreeCOVID-19 Vaccine para sa lahat sa sandaling dumating ito (I encourage you to participate in the pre-registration process we launched today to make the Free COVID-19 Vaccine process faster and better for everyone once it arrives),” Mayor Isko said.“Pumanatag kayo na tanging sertipikado lang ng Food and Drug Administration ang bibilin nating bakuna upang matiyak ito na epektibo at ligtas gamitin (Rest assured that we will only buy vaccines certified by the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that they are effective and safe to use),” he added.\n",
      "Manila residents willing to avail of the vaccine can pre-register through http://manilacovid19vaccine.com.\n",
      "The city government has set aside about P250 million for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "The mayor underscored the importance of being inoculated saying this is an effective way to avoid getting infected by the coronavirus.“Kasabay sa pagbabakuna, ang mga mahahalagang hakbang gaya ng tamang paghuhugas ng kamay, pagsusuot ng face mask at pag iwas sa pakikisalamuha sa maraming tao ay dapat pa rin sundin (Along with vaccination, we should still continue observing proper hand washing, wearing of face mask and avoid large gathering),” the mayor added.\n",
      "In a Twitter post on Thursday night, Domagoso said the city government has reached out to US-based drug manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna for the COVID-19 vaccines they are currently testing.\n",
      "“While it is true that we will prioritize medical frontliners and senior citizens based on the policies of the World Health Organization, DOH (Department of Health) and IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force)… after we vaccinate the said sector, we will immediately start the vaccination for those who are interested to have peace of mind in their daily lives,” he said.The vaccine will be administered in two doses in an interval of four weeks. It reportedly takes a few weeks for the body to establish immunity or protection from diseases after vaccination.\n",
      "Domagoso explained that if a person has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19 before or after they get vaccinated, there is still a chance that they could still get COVID-19.\n",
      "“Ito ay dahil sa ang bakuna ay hindi nagkaroon ng sapat na oras para makabuo ng proteksyon (This is because the vaccine did not have enough time to ensure protection),” he said.“May pagkakataon pa rin na kahit nabakunahan na ay nagkakasakit pa rin ngunit hindi ito malala (There is still a chance that even after being inoculated you will still get sick but it is not serious,” Mayor Isko added.\n",
      "Although there might be some who might get fever or feel weak after being vaccinated, Domagoso noted that these symptoms are normal and are signs that the body is developing protection.“Lahat ng magpapabakuna laban sa COVID-19 ay magdadaan sa masusing pagsusuri (All those who will get the vaccine shots will undergo a thorough examination),” Domagoso assured.

      "Citing that the economic losses to every day under the “new normal” amount to at least P85 billion, House Ways and Means panel Chair Albay 2nd District Rep. Joey Sarte Salceda has proposed that President Duterte be given much leeway or specific powers to implement the COVID-19 response and recovery interventions, and expedite the vaccine procurement, importation, and rollout.\n",
      "(Cong. Joey Salceda’s office / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Under his House Bill No. 8285 or the proposed “Bayanihan sa Bakuna Act”, the House leader wanted to eliminate all the roadblocks to vaccine procurement, distribution, and administration to ensure the immediate importation and rollout of the coronavirus vaccines.\n",
      "“I have authored Bayanihan sa Bakuna Act to cut all the red tape and eliminate any further delay in getting the public vaccinated. The vaccines are available. We have the money. We know the costs of delaying the vaccine. So, we must not tolerate any further delay in getting our people vaccinated,” Salceda said in a statement.“All channels – political, diplomatic, commercial – should be used to procure and roll them out expeditiously and without undue delay,” he stressed.\n",
      "In his bill’s explanatory note, Salceda said the costs of each day of not having the vaccine are staggering.\n",
      "According to the co-chairperson of the Economic Cluster of the Defeat COVID-19 Ad hoc panel, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) estimates that every week of enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) or modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) in the National Capital Region (NCR) and its adjacent regions alone shaves off 0.28 percentage points from the gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n",
      "“This is equivalent to around 2.1 billion pesos in lost wages a day. The amount during GCQ is lower at around 700 million pesos a day, but is nonetheless a major blow to household incomes, particularly during this period of economic hardship, where involuntary hunger has reached unmatched heights in the country’s recent history,” Salceda said.He said the country can no longer absorb the economic losses of any further restriction in economic activity.\n",
      "“This has to end. And there is no better way to end this pandemic than with the quick rollout of the vaccine,” Salceda said.\n",
      "He said under his measure, the President is authorized to exercise the following powers to expedite the procurement and administration of the COVID_19 vaccine and related supplies:-Exempt vaccine procurement from circuitous procurement laws;\n",
      "-Set forth a mandatory vaccination program for health care workers;\n",
      "-Assume health care workers’ medical bills due to COVID-19, including side effects of the vaccine;\n",
      "-Engage the Philippine Red Cross in rolling out the vaccine;\n",
      "-Liberalize the grant of tax incentives for importation of the COVID-19 vaccine;\n",
      "-Create savings from unutilized appropriations, and directs them towards vaccine procurement;\n",
      "-Allocate funds held by GOCCs and national government agencies towards COVID-19 procurement;\n",
      "-Accelerate private sector requests for authorization to import COVID-19 vaccines; and\n",
      "-Facilitate LGU requests to import COVID-19 vaccines, provided that these requests do not compete with the government’s efforts to procure such vaccines.\n",
      "Salceda said his measure also seeks to waive the Phase IV requirement for vaccine approval, under certain conditions.\n",
      "It also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve vaccines that have already been tested on Filipinos abroad, he said.\n",
      "“Thousands of nurses in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the Middle East, are Filipinos. Actually, given that many of these areas manufactured vaccines, our nurses were first in the line for the vaccine there. So, there is no reason to disapprove vaccines that were proven effective for our fellow Filipinos, since the allergy profile should be the same,” he said.\n",
      "Under the bill, the FDA and other relevant agencies are mandated “to expedite authorizations for vaccines for which trials have been conducted successfully on Filipinos without serious adverse effects, as certified by counterparts in other countries.”The measure also empowers the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) to explore diplomatic channels to accelerate vaccine procurement.\n",
      "The bill also seeks to identify the sources of funding for vaccine procurement, even as it calls for the creation of a congressional oversight committee to ensure that the Executive faithfully and expeditiously implements the proposed Act.\n",
      "“The vaccines are available. Let’s waste no time, especially when lives, jobs, and our economic future are on the line,” Salceda said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday said that it already approved the application of Belgium-based Janssen Pharmaceutical to hold Phase III clinical trials in the Philippines for its COVID-19 candidate vaccine.FDA Director General Rolando Enrique Domingo said that Jannsen passed the evaluation of the country’s health regulators. This will be the first independent trial that will be conducted in the Philippines.“We approved one. This is Janssen’s clinical trial. This has been given the go signal by FDA and they will start the clinical trial maybe after (the start of the) new year,” said Domingo during a press briefing.\n",
      "Domingo said that they are currently reviewing the application of two pharmaceutical companies from China: the Sinovac Biotech and Clover Pharmaceuticals. Both Chinese firms already passed the evaluation of the vaccine experts panel of the Department of Science and Technology and the Single Joint Review Ethics Board.They just need to secure the nod from the FDA before they could begin the clinical trials of their respective COVID-19 candidate vaccine in the Philippines. Meanwhile, Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Solidarity Trials for Vaccines may also start next month.“They have committed to us that maybe by the third week of January we can already start. In preparation and based also with the agreements with them when we had our meeting, we are now preparing the sites for the WHO Solidarity Trials for Vaccines,” she said.\n",
      "Furthermore, Domingo said that as of now,the only pharmaceutical company that has submitted its application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine in the country was American-drugmaker Pfizer.“It was submitted to us on December 23. It is already being reviewed by ourevaluators and we hope to complete the preliminary evaluationwithin two weeks,” said Domingo.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon on Tuesday backed the position of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in saying that the distribution and administration of unauthorized Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine without the proper authorization is illegal and punishable by law.\n",
      "Senator Franklin Drilon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "At the same time, Drilon questioned how the China-made vaccines were able to get past the Bureau of Customs (BoC).\n",
      "“As government officials, our priority is the safety of our people. That is the very purpose of FDA authorization—to make sure that the vaccines that we administer to our people are safe, effective and of certain quality,” Drilon said in a statement.\n",
      "“We, the leaders, should only obtain, approve and administer vaccines to our people, which we ourselves, will use,” the senator added.\n",
      "The minority leader further said that the reported inoculation of some Cabinet officials and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) “sets a bad example” and undermines the very purpose of the creation of the FDA. It is also a clear violation of FDA Circular No. 2020-036 or the “Guidelines on the Issuance of Emergency Use Authorization for Drugs and Vaccines for COVID-19.”\n",
      "The FDA, he said, exists to ensure the “purity, safety, efficacy and quality of drugs and vaccines in the country.”\n",
      "“What was done completely dismissed the well-entrenched public safety and health protocols. It further undermined the regulatory authority of the FDA with regard to the inspection, licensing and monitoring of establishments and the registration and monitoring of health products,” Drilon stressed.\n",
      "Under the FDA Law or Republic Act No. 3720, as amended by RA No. 9711, Drilon said the law prohibits the “manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, non-consumer use, promotion, advertising or sponsorship of any health product that is adulterated, unregistered or misbranded or any health product which, although requiring registration, is not registered with the FDA pursuant to this Act.”\n",
      "Section 21 of the same law, he said, also provides that no person shall manufacture, sell, offer for sale or transfer any new drug unless there is a full report of investigations showing the drug is safe, efficacious and of good quality based on clinical studies prior to manufacture, sale and importation and distribution.\n",
      "He also said the FDA Circular applies both to pharmaceutical industries and government entities such as national procurer or health program implementers requires the issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which must be filed and obtained from the FDA.\n",
      "The EUA is an authorization for unregistered drugs and vaccines in a public health emergency, which can be obtained upon demonstration of safety, effectiveness and quality.\n",
      "“In this case, no Emergency Use Authorization was ever issued prior to the inoculation of the above-mentioned officials,” Drilon lamented.\n",
      "Under the FDA Law, any person who violates any of the provision of Section 11 of RA 3720, as amended, faces a penalty of imprisonment ranging from 1 to 10 years or a fine of not less P50-thousand but not more than half a million or both.\n",
      "Manufacturers, importers or distributors face stiffer penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment and a fine of P500 thousand to P5-million.\n",
      "However, Drilon said the Filipinos could only hope that what transpired will not influence the FDA’s decision-making process in issuing an EUA to unregistered vaccines, including the China-made vaccines.\n",
      "The FDA, he said, can also issue cease and desist orders motu propio or upon verified complaint for health products, whether or not registered with the FDA.\n",
      "“I hope this does not give us a glimpse of how they intend to implement the biggest vaccine drive in Philippine history. Otherwise, we are doomed,” Drilon said.\n",
      "“I hope that when the government’s COVID-19 vaccination starts—with FDA-authorized vaccines—front-line healthcare workers and the poor should be given priority. Let the front-line doctors and nurses get the first and limited shots. No one should cut in line,” he stressed. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

With the current pandemic, PSG needs to ensure that they are not themselves threat to the President’s health and safety. As such the PSG administered COVID-19 vaccine to its personnel performing close-in security operations to the President,” Durante said in a statement.\n",
      "“COVID-19 is a first in history, and the whole world is hopeful in developing and obtaining the perfect vaccine. PSG’s decision to take the risk is a courageous step that greatly supports its mandate. We did it not for personal agenda but on a greater pursuit that is even way beyond our mission of protecting our President,” he added.\n",
      "Durante also said the PSG’s main task is to ensure the country has “a healthy President serving our fellow Filipinos every day.” “National security imposes the protection of the President being the Commander in-Chief from all forms of threat, especially COVID-19, in order to preserve the stability of our nation,” he said.\n",
      "In getting the COVID vaccines for its personnel,Durante said the PSG has exhausted means to carry out its mission of protecting the President. “We are in a state of war, a war against COVID 19. War compels us to survive as what we are now doing in this pandemic. As such, PSG exploits all means in order to deliver its mandate as what is highly expected of them by the Filipino people,’ he said.\n",
      "The Armed Forces earlier admitted that the PSG troopers were the first from its ranks to receive COVID vaccines as part of its mission. The same revelation was reportedly made by Interior and Local Government Secretary Eduardo Año Monday.President Duterte, in a televised address over the weekend, revealed that some soldiers were inoculated with coronavirus vaccines to ensure their health amid the pandemic.In a later interview over DZRH, Durante said the COVID vaccination of the PSG personnel started around two months ago. He said it was an “independent move” by the PSG, adding he no longer asked permission from the President on the matter.\n",
      "So far, Durante said they have not seen any adverse effect of the vaccines on the PSG troopers. No one also tested positive for coronavirus so far, he added.Durante however declined to identify the vaccine given to the PSG personnel.“I take responsibility for that action.

This is why only vaccines which have been approved and found to be safe should be administered,” the Health department said in a statement.It added that the administration of approved vaccines is also accompanied by strict monitoring of all vaccine recipients in order to ensure proper management of possible effects.“Rest assured that the FDA is observing utmost diligence in the regulation of vaccines. Vaccines will only be approved if there is reasonable scientific evidence to show that benefit outweighs risk.” Domingo said.“We will concentrate on making sure that only vaccines that pass standards will be made available to the public,” he added.

      "While the government has yet to approve the use of any COVID-19 vaccine, “some” members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), particularly from the Presidential Security Group (PSG), apparently have been vaccinated against the viral disease, the country’s top Philippine Army (PA) official confirmed Monday.\n",
      "(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana, Army commanding general, said he personally knew some “officials and non-commissioned officers” who received the vaccine shots.The Army Chief’s revelation came in the wake of President Duterte’s pronouncement last Saturday that “many” Filipinos have already received China’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Sinopharm.Sobejana refused to identify them or the unit to which they belong.\n",
      "“I know of some but I could not just disclose the unit. Personally, I know mayroon nang nabakunahan sa hanay po ng Armed Forces (some of the personnel of the Armed Forces have already been vaccinated),” Sobejana said in a radio interview over DWIZ.\n",
      "“Hindi ko maibigay ang accurate number but I confirm that some of our members ay nabakunahan. Hindi naman libo. Considering the population of our Armed Forces, hindi ganoon karami (I could not give the accurate number but I confirm that some of our members were vaccinated. It did not reach thousands. Considering the population of the Armed Forces, it’s not that many),” he added.\n",
      "But Major General Edgard Arevalo, AFP spokesperson, bared that they found out it was members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) from the AFP who were the first ones given by a COVID-19 vaccine shot.“As the unit primarily tasked to protect and secure the highest official of the land, the PSG will have to ensure that the President is safe from all threats—including COVID-19,” he said.\n",
      "“Because the safety of the President equates to national well-being, that security posture should necessarily include protecting the Commander-in-Chief from contracting the deadly virus from those he is constantly exposed to like the members of his security detail,” he added.\n",
      "It was not clear whether the soldiers who had been reportedly vaccinated are or have been COVID-19 patients but Sobejana said they were already “doing okay” and no negative effects were observed on them so far.\n",
      "‘Unaware’The AFP leadership denied that there is an AFP-sanctioned COVID-19 vaccination among its personnel as it distanced itself from Sobejana’s remarks.\n",
      "“The AFP is not aware of COVID-19 inoculation made to military personnel. We do not have an AFP leadership-sanctioned vaccination,” said Major General Edgard Arevalo, AFP spokesperson.\n",
      "For his part, Sobejana said the vaccination of the soldiers was a decision made by the military higher-ups, even attributing it to President Duterte.\n",
      "“Our President is our Commander in Chief in the AFP. I should say that it is from the chain of command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,” he said.\n",
      "The Army Chief’s revelation came in the wake of President Duterte’s pronouncement last Saturday that “many” Filipinos have already received China’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Sinopharm.However, Sobejana did not particularly identify whether it was the Sinopharm vaccine that was given to the soldiers.\n",
      "“Hindi ko alam anong klaseng vaccine but I know mayroon ng vaccine na naibigay (I don’t know what kind of vaccine but I know that a vaccine was already distributed),” he said.\n",
      "Justify\n",
      "To date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved the use of any COVID-19 vaccine in the country.\n",
      "Under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 3720 or the amended Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, it states that any new drug “should have an authorization from the FDA based on an application containing full reports of investigations.”\n",
      "This, the law states, is to show “whether or not such drug is safe, efficacious and of good quality for use based on clinical studies, prior to manufacture, sale, importation, exportation, distribution or transfer thereof.”\n",
      "Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 and the designated vaccine czar, earlier warned that only the national government is duly authorized to procure and administer COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Galvez, a former AFP Chief, said any other offers of guaranteed access to any of the vaccines “is not only illegal but also life-threatening.”\n",
      "Apparently setting the laws aside, Sobejana justified the decision of the soldiers to be vaccinated, saying they “did not hesitate” to do it so they can better protect themselves and serve the country.\n",
      "“Mayroon naman po sigurong paliwanag ‘yung mga doctor na nagbigay ng bakuna sa kanila at hindi naman po sila nag-alinlangan (Maybe the doctors who gave the soldiers the vaccine have a good explanation as to why they did it, and they [soldiers] did not hesitate),” he said.\n",
      "“We are optimistic na itong vaccine na naibigay sa mga sundalo ay magiging epektibo para lalo tayong makapagbigay serbisyo sa ating mga kababayan (We are optimistic that the vaccine given to our soldiers will be effective so we could better serve our countrymen,” he added.

      "Senator Pia Cayetano said COVID-19 vaccines and other devices and raw materials needed for the government’s vaccination program could already have been exempted from Value Added Tax (VAT) had Congress adopted the Senate’s version of the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) bill.\n",

      "Cayetano, who chairs the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, expressed belief this could be a setback to the country’s COVID-19 immunization efforts, which is badly needed by the government to contain the pandemic.“I agree with the call of my House counterpart to exempt COVID-19 vaccines from tax,” said Cayetano, responding to House Ways and Means Committee chair Rep. Joey Salceda’s call for the government to make the vaccines tax-free.“In fact, VAT exemption is already provided in the CREATE bill, which the Senate passed on third and final reading last Nov. 26,” said Cayetano, who chairs the Senate Committee on Ways and Means.She said senators wanted a comprehensive list of exemptions to cover, not just the vaccines, but also all drugs, devices, raw materials, and capital equipment needed to help the government’s COVID-19 response.Under the Senate’s version of the bill, VAT exemption for the sale and importation of all drugs, vaccines, and medical devices specifically prescribed and directly used for the treatment of COVID-19 will start beginning January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023.Capital equipment, its spare parts, and raw materials necessary for the production of personnel protective equipment for COVID-19 prevention are supposedly also covered.The Senate also sought to exempt from VAT drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in clinical trials, including raw materials directly necessary for the production of such drugs for that same period.“This could have already been a law now if only the House of Representatives saw the merit in adopting our version before the session ended this year,” she lamented.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri urged Malacanang Sunday to choose COVID-19 vaccines that have been peer-reviewed by the scientific community and have a higher percentage of efficacy.\n",
      "(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Zubiri made the call after Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that a Chinese-made vaccine against COVID-19 that was at least 50 percent effective can be used for the government’s vaccination program.\n",
      "The senator said it is imperative for the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) to choose a vaccine that has a higher efficacy rate and cost-effective, and, at the same time, have been reviewed by the scientific community.“Ayaw naman po namin mamilit, kasi pag namilit kami baka sabihin meron pang mga kickback ‘yung mga senador (We don’t want to insist, because if we do, they might accuse us senators of gaining kickbacks),” Zubiri said in an interview over radio DZBB.\n",
      "“Ang gusto lang po namin, magkaroon ng recommendation na dapat ‘yan (vaccines na bibilhin) ay accepted ng scientific community, accepted ng buong mundo. Dahil may mga bansa talaga na hindi sila papayag na 50 percent efficacy (All we want is that the vaccines that would be recommended for procurement are accepted by the scientific community, accepted worldwide. Because there are countries that will not accept a 50 percent efficacy),” he said.\n",
      "Even the Malaysian government, he said, has chosen to procure vaccines that have a higher effectivity rate and peer-reviewed.\n",
      "“They will choose a vaccine with a higher effectivity, and peer-reviewed ng scientific community (and peer-reviewed by the scientific community),” Zubiri said.\n",
      "“Ang masama kasi (What is bad), with all due respect to Sinopharm and the Chinese-made vaccines, hindi pa po sila na (they are not yet) peer-reviewed. In other words, wala pa pong findings na lumalabas na official findings ng bansa (The country has not yet released its official findings on the vaccine),” he added.\n",
      "In contrast to US-made COVID-19 vaccines like Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca, the lawmaker stressed their studies were already peer-reviewed and at the same time are cost-effective and have a higher efficacy rate.“So bakit po tayo pipili ng bakuna na 50-50 chance na makuha mo pa rin ‘yung COVID-19 paglabas mo ng bahay? (So why will we choose a vaccine that has a 50-50 chance that you can still get infected by COVID-19 when you step out of the house?)” he said.\n",
      "Besides, Zubiri said, even China ordered 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, as reported by international media outfits.\n",
      "“We’re asking Malacanang to pick the best one. Kung pipili sila ‘yung pinakamaganda and pinakaepektibo na. Hindi ko na maintindihan, bakit ‘yung China nag-order din sila ng 100 million doses from Pfizer (If they’re going to choose, they should choose the best and most effective. I also don’t understand why China itself ordered 100 million doses from Pfizer),” he added.\n",
      "Zubiri said buying COVID-19 vaccines that are less effective would only be a waste of government resources. “So let’s make the maximum use of it. Baka humiram tayo ng pera, mahirap ang bansa na kumita ngayon…napakaliit ng ating resources (We might have to resort to borrowing and yet it’s hard for the country to recover financially…We have limited resources),” he said.The government, he said, should not treat the matter of COVID-19 vaccine procurement lightly as getting infected with the coronavirus is no joke.“In all due honesty, for the sake of the Filipino people, let’s remember hindi po joke ang COVID (COVID-19 is no joke).

      "The chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means has called on the government to exempt COVID-19 vaccines from Value-Added Tax and import duties.\n",
      "After pushing strongly for a number of tax measures aimed at increasing government income, Albay Rep. Joey Sarte Salceda now wants COVID-19 vaccine importation freed from any tax loads, saying that these “are friction costs and administrative burdens that could delay vaccine procurement and distribution.”\n",
      "(Cong. Joey Salceda’s office / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "He said the government must start stockpiling syringes and address swiftly the need for cold storage facilities and other immunization requisites.Salceda, vice chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, said the private sector should be given enough leeway to help the government immediately and effectively address the COVID-19 problem.\n",
      "“On the question of whether the private sector should be able to import the COVID-19 vaccines without taxes and duties, my answer is an unambiguous yes,” he said.\n",
      "Salceda added: “Each day that we are unable to return to the ‘old normal’ costs the economy P85 billion at least. The benefit of removing the tariff and tax barriers to importing COVID-19 vaccines is critical to fast-tracking mass vaccination by several days.”\n",
      "According to the veteran administration congressman, “a cost benefit analysis he conducted indicated “very clearly on the side of frictionless importation.”“Every day will be lifesaving,” Salceda stressed.\n",
      "At the same time, Salceda called for the immediate passage of the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or the CREATE Act.The bill contains a provision for VAT exemption for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.\n",
      "“Of course, that has to be subject to some limits of time, but generally, the government should not try to collect on drugs and vaccines for this health emergency,” Salceda said.He added that the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA) allows the President to suspend duties for COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“Under Chapter 2, Section 1608 of the CMTA, or the ‘Flexible Clause,’ President Duterte can suspend the tariffs on COVID-19 vaccines, upon the recommendation of the NEDA. We can also legislate this. I am in constant communication with the economic managers, so, once the first shipments are ready, we can easily recommend the suspension of duties,” he said.\n",
      "Salceda also said that the government should plan and prepare contingencies for stockpiling syringes, needles, and other mass vaccination needs.\n",
      "“As you know, the world is in some sort of vaccination rush, so one can expect shortages of syringes, needles, and other vaccination needs. We are looking at four to seven billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines being administered in 2021 and 2022. We need to have contingencies. Congress is ready to appropriate the necessary funding, but we need a good plan from the executive,” Salceda said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "(NOEL CELIS / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“Why settle for 50 percent efficacy when we can go for thevaccines with 95 percent efficacy? Let us give our people the best protection they deserve. Buhay ng mamamayang Pilipino ang nakataya dito. (The lives of the Filipino people are at stake here),” Fortun said.\n",
      "According to the member of the House minority bloc, it would be “nonsense”for the Filipinos and the Duterte government to choose the China vaccine “at this point.”He noted that the vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna have up to 95 percent and 94 percent efficacy based on Phase 3 clinical trial results while the China vaccine has yet to complete Phase 3 testing and available information showed only 50 percent efficacy and costing about the same as the vaccines with 94 to 95 percent efficacy.\n",
      "“Our government must not give in to any overture, pressure, or campaigning by the Chinese government, the Chinese Embassy, or any of their proxies. Our government should abandon any prior verbal agreement they may have had. They should politely decline the offers about Sinovac,” Fortun said.“Our DoST (Department of Science and Technology) scientists and DoH (Department of Health) authorities must not give way to any pressure from either the Chinese government or our national political leaders as regards Sinovac.”\n",
      "Fortun thanked the DoST-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) for publicly disclosing that the Sinovac vaccine from China has only 50 percent efficacy.“They were simply stating how Sinovac is at the minimum range of the bar applicant vaccines are supposed to hurdle. The Filipino people must now express to the IATF and to Malacanang what they prefer to be administered to them when their turn comes for vaccination against COVID-19,” he said.He said every Filipino needs only needs common sense to compare the vaccine choices.“No sane Filipino should allow himself or herself to be injected with a vaccine like Sinovac which barely hurdled the minimum standards.”\n",
      "“Whatever political game was afoot involving Sinovac, it is now game over, thanks to the DoST scientists who decided to reveal the truth about Sinovac.”\n",
      "DoST-PCHRD Executive Director Jaime Montoya had earlier described as “acceptable” the50 percent efficacy of China’s Sinovac vaccine, explaining that “it is the minimum requirement set by the World Health Organization for a vaccine to be used by the country.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "De Lima said Christmas remains to be the season of hope and the time to give back and be grateful.\n",
      "“For our country, I wish that every Filipino will be given access to the COVID-19 vaccine so that all can move on from this pandemic without worrying for their health and safety,” De Lima said.\n",
      "“Let’s give to our COVID-19 frontliners, typhoon and disaster responders, and the individuals and groups who reach out to those who need help the most during times of disaster out of generosity and a pure desire to help,” she further said.\n",
      "“Their sacrifices made our sufferings bearable and humane. They gifted us with their love, and some of them with their lives, through their selfless acts of heroism. Let’s honor them and show them how grateful we are,” she added.\n",

      "But Filipinos, he said, should never lose hope, even if the COVID-19 pandemic was totally unexpected “and changed all of our lives.”\n",
      "“No one was spared. Then the storms came, in succession, battering several parts of Luzon and leaving our already struggling kababayans down on their knees. Rarely have our people been through so much hardship and suffering in such a short period of time,” Angara said.\n",
      "“But as Filipinos, we never lose hope. No matter how daunting the trials that come our way, we always see the silver lining and find reasons to smile.\n",

      "“Businesses are starting to open up again and people are feeling more comfortable about leaving their homes,” he pointed out.\n",
      "“And with several vaccines very close to distribution, we are hopeful that 2021 will be a better year for us all,” Angara added.\n",
      "“We may not be able to celebrate in the same way we have in previous years– we may be forced to meet with our friends and family virtually, but this Christmas will be no less meaningful,” he stressed.\n",
      "For her part, Sen. Nancy Binay said that despite the many trials experienced by Filipinos in the year 2020, she finds it heartening to know that there are Filipinos who would always be willing and ready to lend a hand and a heart whenever life gets rough.\n",
      "“May we always find hope and joy in celebrating Christmas as we share our hearts full of compassion, and faith. So, let us share happiness and the love in our hearts to lift the spirits and improve the lives of those who have lost their homes, jobs, livelihood, and loved ones,” Binay said.\n",
      "“As a nation, we had to brave storms and endure the many challenges posed by these trying times. But all these shall pass as we find love and hope this Christmas and the year ahead,” she stressed.\n",
      "Meantime, senator Richard J. Gordon, chairman and CEO of the Philippine Red Cross (PRC), on Friday prayed that Filipinos continue to find happiness during these trying times, most especially this holiday season.\n",
      "‘’May we continue to pray to the Lord Jesus Christ for the safety of our families from the threat of COVID-19 and to awaken our consciousness to the injustices rampant in our country today so that we may be men and women of action, service, and change,’’ Gordon, chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon committee, said.\n",
      "‘’May we may never cease to be a blessing to others amidst all the challenges we have braved this year, and may we continue to find happiness during these trying times, most especially this holiday season,’’ he added. (With a report from Mario B. Casayuran) SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“The different storage and handling requirements of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine mean that it can be distributed to isolated and remote communities, including the territories,” it added.\n",
      "The Moderna vaccine can be stored at -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit), much warmer than Pfizer’s vaccine which must be kept at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), making it easier to distribute.\n",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said previously that Canada is set to receive up to 168,000 doses of Moderna’s vaccine before the end of December, part of the guaranteed 40 million it has secured.\n",
      "Delivery could begin within 48 hours of the Moderna vaccine’s approval, he said earlier this month.Canada began vaccinating people in high-risk categories — including frontline health care workers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities — on December 14, with its relatively limited supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use a cutting-edge technology based on mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) which makes the human cells they enter express a surface protein of the new coronavirus.This simulates an infection and trains the immune system to be ready in case it encounters the real virus.In total, Canada — a country of 38 million — has placed orders or options on more than 400 million doses of vaccine from seven pharmaceutical groups.The country will share any excess doses with other countries, Trudeau has said.\n",
      "Canada plans to vaccinate three million people by the end of the first quarter of 2021.The country, where the spread of the virus accelerated as the holiday season approached, on Wednesday had recorded more than 523,000 cases of coronavirus and nearly 14,500 deaths since the start of the pandemic.

      "Transmission firm National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) is seeking lawmakers’ imprimatur for it to be allowed to import Covid-19 vaccine tax-free as these doses will be used for its employees.NGCP President Anthony L. Almeda said with this gesture from the State, businesses would be able to bounce back and they could consequently “give the economy much-needed boost in activity.”The transmission company also has various activities and projects affected by the pandemic, therefore, it will be very crucial for it to bring in vaccine the soonest possible time especially for its employees since NGCP’s line of business and function is very critical in ensuring the country’s reliable electricity supply.\n",
      "NGCP has massive human resources of 5,000, and the company admitted that it has been closely monitoring the progress and rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in other countries.Taking cue from developments on the other parts of the world, the transmission firm indicated that it is also prudently assessing the possibility of providing vaccine doses to its employees, including its essential workers like grid dispatchers and transmission personnel.Relative to NGCP’s appeal, Almeda propounded for a passage of a law “encouraging the private sector to provide vaccination to its employees.”He explained that “vaccination, as well as mass testing, is focally critical in the fight against Covid-19,”adding that with these measures, entities like them would be able to “prevent, detect, isolate and treat” personnel who would be affected in the workplace.Almeda similarly pointed out “we need to jumpstart the economy now, but we need to ensure that we stack the odds against infections in the workplace.”He thus emphasized that “with a vaccination program in place for the private sector, more businesses and industries will be able to regain some semblance of normal activity, bounce back and put the economy on its way to recovery after almost a year of slowdown.”\n",
      "As the world is now on its last stretch into accessing the ‘cure’ to the niggling pandemic, Almeda similarly called on counterparts and peers in the private and public sectors “to be similarly proactive in protecting their employees, so that we can keep the economy running at full speed.”And while the company waits for the vaccine and continues to operate efficiently, it noted that it has been stepping up on its commitment “to enforce all health and safety protocols,” as mandated by the Department of Health and the Department of Labor and Employment.NGCP further stated that it keeps on with its drive in helping local governments, national health agencies and various agencies in battling the health crisis.

      "“Dahil ang mga guro, mga punong-guro, at kawani ng mga paaralan ay nagsisilbing mga frontliners sa pagpapatuloy ng edukasyon, nararapat lamang na mabilang sila sa mga unang makakatanggap ng bakuna laban sa COVID-19 (because teachers, principals and school administrators serve as frontliners to ensure continuity of education, it is only fitting that they are the first to receive this vaccine against COVID-19),” Gatchalian said in a statement.\n",
      "Since the pandemic struck, Gatchalian noted that the country’s more than 900,000 teachers and non-teaching staff have been serving as frontliners to ensure learning continuity for more than 22 million learners.\n",
      "But despite the social restrictions imposed by the National Task Force Against COVID-19, the senator stressed the need for schools to reopen as soon as possible to prevent an exacerbation of the learning crisis hounding the country.\n",
      "The lawmaker pointed out the Philippines is lagging globally and failing to master basic competencies as shown in global assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2019, and the Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics (SEA-PLM) 2019.\n",
      "All of these international student assessment tests, he said, were administered before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "Gatchalian recalled that when teachers were preparing for the implementation of distance learning, they distributed learning materials used by almost 87 percent of public school learners even at the risk of their health and safety.\n",
      "“Mahalagang hakbang ito upang matiyak nating ang pagbabalik n gating mga magaaral sa mga paaralan ay magiging ligtas (This is a crucial step for us to ensure that the resumption of classes in schools will be safe),” he said.\n",
      "The Department of Education (DepEd) is already bracing for a dry run of limited and localized face-to-face classes in selected schools ahead of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.\n",
      "However, Gatchalian reiterated the need to strictly observe health protocols such as physical distancing, wearing of face masks and regular hand washing to protect students against the threat of the coronavirus despite the possibility of starting limited face-to-face classes.

      "The government is hoping to secure 60 million more doses of coronavirus vaccines in the second and third quarter of 2021 if certain supply deals could be finalized this month.\n",
      "Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 (NTF AGAINST COVID-19 / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "In a meeting with President Duterte Monday night, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government was in the middle of talks with the Novavax and AstraZeneca vaccine makers to secure supplies for the country.\n",
      "“Natutuwa po kami, Mr. President, marami pong positive results at ikukuwento po namin sa inyo (We are happy Mr. President. We have many positive results we want to share with you),” Galvez said in his remarks aired on State television Monday.Galvez informed the President that Serum Institute of India has agreed to provide 30 million doses of vaccines to the Philippines on a “non-profit, no loss concept” where the vaccines will be given at lower cost. “A vaccine shot will cost around $5 or “P500 for two shots,” he added.\n",
      "He said the country representative of the Indian company also assured him that it would not seek cash advance for the country’s vaccine acquisition. “Ibig sabihin ‘yung lahat po ng transaction po natin magiging flexible. And he will comply with your guidance na wala pong cash advance (This means all transactions will be flexible and he will comply with your guidance that there will be no cash advance),” he said.\n",
      "More discussions with the Novavax manufacturer will be held this Wednesday, Galvez said.\n",

This is an American brand that will be made in India),” he said.Another supply deal with United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca for an additional 30 million more doses may be finalized within the month if it secures approval from United Kingdom’s regulatory authorities, according to Galvez.\n",
      "The government in partnership with the private sector signed last month a supply deal for 2.6 million vaccine doses from AstraZeneca.\n",
      "“Hindi po tayo bibitawan ng AstraZeneca (AstraZeneca will not let us go),” Galvez told the President.“Baka this coming next week, either Dec. 28 o 29, inaantay lang po namin ‘yung — ‘yung Ministry of Health Regulatory Authorization ng UK at puwede na po naming pirmahan ‘yung ano po, ‘yung kontrata. Ito naman po ay 20 million doses at 10 million doses for LGU at saka po sa ating private sector (Maybe this coming next week, either Dec. 28 or 29, we are just waiting for the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Health regulatory authorization and we can sign the contract. This involves 20 million doses and 10 million doses for the local government units and our private sector),” he said.\n",
      "“So all in all po, kung magkakaroon po tayo ng pirmahan this coming month, mayroon po tayong 60 million for the second quarter at saka third quarter po (So all in all, if we can have the contract signing this month, we will have 60 million for the second quarter and third quarter),” he said.\n",
      "The government identified P73 billion in funding sources for the acquisition of coronavirus vaccines. The free vaccines will be initially be distributed to around 24.6 million priority beneficiaries including the country’s health workers, seniors, poor citizens, and uniformed personnel.\n",

      "TAGBILARAN CITY—The Bohol Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) plans to raise a P10-million seed fund to buy COVID-19 vaccines for the private sector frontline workers to ensure their protection from the virus.\n",
      "BCCI member Atty. Lucas Nunag told an online Kapihan sa PIA radio forum that for a person to have enough protection against the COVID-19 virus, one must spend between P150 to P1,850 for the two doses of vaccine and between P2,500 to P4,500 for the standard test called Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).\n",
      "Nunag said that should the BCCI succeed in this fund-raising campaign, all store keepers, sales clerks, promo merchandisers, drivers, conductors, laborers, construction workers, and those working for their companies under the BCCI can be inoculated.He added that if the tourism industry stakeholders and establishment owners here could raise enough funds from local sources, it would be easier to leverage the same for national funds as counterpart.\n",
      "Nunag, who owns a tropical resort in Panglao, added that this would be a pro-active move towards economic recovery and would send a reassuring message to tourists that Bohol is a safe destination.\n",
      "“We would rather go for a P1,800 double dose of the vaccine than spend P4,500 for a simple test which does not yet cover treatment costs.The sooner we can raise the funds, the better it would be for Bohol,” Nunag added.\n",
      "Nunag leads the Provincial Tourism Council (PTC) in Bohol and has been at the forefront of re-opening Bohol’s tourism. If the plan pushes through, Boholano workers can be well protected from the virus and enhance the confidence of the tourists to come to Bohol, he said.This can also help the people and the local economy to recover from the crippling impact of the pandemic.Nunag admitted that it might take long before Bohol can return to pre-COVID normal but said everything must be put in place for the reopening of Bohol to tourists.

      "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver (Photo by Stacy Revere / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / AFP)NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Monday the league would not “jump the line” for the Covid-19 vaccine as the league prepared to tip off its new season amid a surge in coronavirus cases across the United States.\n",
      "Speaking on a conference call ahead of the start of the 2020-2021 season on Tuesday, Silver emphasised that the NBA would “wait our turn” to obtain the vaccine, which began to be administered for the first time last week.\n",
      "“It goes without saying that in no form or way will we jump the line,” Silver told reporters. “We will wait our turn to get the vaccine.”Silver said he hoped NBA players and staff would eventually play a role in helping to assure the public of the benefits of getting the vaccine.\n",
      "“It’s my hope that when we are eligible, members of the NBA community will want to get vaccinated and it’s our plan to be involved with governmental efforts in terms of public messaging as to the benefit of taking the vaccine,” he said.\n",
      "The NBA was shut down for four months last season as the pandemic swept across North America before resuming in July with teams based in a protective quarantine bubble in Orlando, Florida.\n",
      "However the new season will take place with teams playing in their home markets, a move that represents myriad logistical challenges for the NBA and its 30 teams amid skyrocketing Covid-19 cases in many states.\n",
      "Season bubble ‘untenable’Silver said playing an entire season in a bubble-like campus environment was deemed to be “untenable” but insisted he was confident of health and safety protocols put in place to mitigate the risk from the virus.\n",
      "“I’ve been asked many times ‘Why are you starting your season now, given the state of the pandemic?'” Silver said.\n",
      "“It’s a fair question and the short answer is that we’re comfortable with the health and safety protocols we’ve designed in consultation with the players association and our medical experts.“We would not be opening our season if we did not believe it was safe and responsible to do so.”\n",
      "Silver added however that the league was preparing for disruption, referring to a sense of “trepidation” about Tuesday’s tip-off.\n",
      "NBA chiefs have only released a schedule of games for the first half of the abbreviated 72-game season, and will finalise the second half of the calender at a later date.\n",
      "“We do anticipate there will be bumps in the road along the way,” Silver said. “We’re waiting to see how this plays out before issuing the second half of the season. We know it’s possible we may have to reschedule games along the way.”\n",
      "Silver said only six teams would start the season with fans in attendance at their arenas and described the return of spectators as a “huge priority.”\n",
      "Anthem hope“But at the same time I recognise that until we have mass distribution of the vaccine it’s unlikely that we’re going to return to the point of having full arenas,” he cautioned, adding that the league estimated a 40% dip in total revenues if no fans at all were present during the season.\n",
      "Silver meanwhile said that after the social justice initiatives adopted last season following the death of George Floyd in May, when “Black Lives Matter” adorned every court following the restart and players kneeled for the national anthem, he hoped players would return to standing for the anthem.\n",
      "“It’s a national ritual of sorts that I hope, personally, isn’t something that’s lost,” Silver said.\n",
      "“Because there are very few things that bring us together these days. So it’s my expectation that going into the season we’re going to return to the practice that’s been part of this league for many decades, and that is standing for the national anthem.”\n",
      "NBA rules require players to stand for the pre-game anthem ritual.\n",
      "Silver emphasised however that the league would not punish players who chose to protest the anthem by taking a knee.\n",
      "“It’s a complicated issue,” he said. “Certainly, I’m not focusing in any way right now on discipline. I recognise this is a very emotional issue on both sides. I think it calls for engagement rather than simply rule enforcement.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "US President-elect Joe Biden received a Covid-19 vaccine live on television Monday in a campaign to boost Americans’ confidence in the jabs — and in marked contrast to President Donald Trump’s mixed messaging.\n",
      "US President-elect Joe Biden receives a Covid-19 vaccination from Tabe Masa, Nurse Practitioner, at the Christiana Care hospital in Newark, Delaware\n",
      "The 78-year-old incoming president got the Pfizer vaccine at the Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. His wife Jill received the shot earlier, the presidential transition team said.\n",
      "Biden told Americans “there’s nothing to worry about” when they get vaccinated and that in the meantime they should keep wearing masks and “listen to the experts.”He and the future first lady were the latest high-profile political figures publicly joining the first wave of vaccinations aimed at stopping a pandemic that has killed almost 318,000 Americans.\n",
      "Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband will be vaccinated next week.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the serving vice president, Mike Pence, and his wife got vaccinations last week. Trump, however, has yet to take part in the drive.\n",
      "The Republican leader — who has become consumed by pushing conspiracy theories that his election loss to Biden was the result of mass fraud — cites the natural immunity he is believed to enjoy after recovering from a bout of coronavirus.Surgeon general Jerome Adams reinforced that argument at the weekend that, saying that due to the antibodies the president received from his infection, “that is actually one scenario where we tell people maybe you should hold off on getting the vaccine.”\n",
      "However, he has done little, even in terms of issuing statements, to support the campaign to overcome Americans’ vaccine skepticism.\n",
      "His wife, Melania Trump, who likewise contracted Covid-19, has also been largely absent from the issue.The inconsistent messaging is part of a pattern with Trump, who throughout the pandemic has veered from declaring himself a wartime leader to scoffing at scientists and insisting that the disease will go away without major changes in Americans’ daily lives.\n",
      "– Oldest to assume presidency –\n",
      "Biden will be the oldest president ever to take office on January 20.\n",
      "This was the first shot in the two-stage Pfizer vaccine and he said he was “looking forward” to the follow-up.\n",
      "Biden praised “the scientists and the people who put this together — frontline workers, people who were the ones who actually did the clinical work.”\n",
      "He called medical workers “amazing and incredible.”\n",
      "Biden also had some rare praise for the Trump administration, which he said “deserves some credit” for overseeing record-speedy development and production of vaccines.\n",
      "Distribution of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines began a week ago and on Monday a second vaccine, this time made by Moderna, went into use.\n",
      "But Biden, who spoke through a double mask, cautioned that there was still a long way to go before the inoculations can really halt the virus’ spread.\n",
      "“It’s worth stating that, you know, this is just the beginning,” he said. “It’s going to take time.”\n",
      "“In the meantime,” he said, “I hope people listen to all the experts… talking about the need to wear masks” during the holidays.\n",
      "“If you don’t have to travel, don’t travel. It’s really important.”\n",
      "Large numbers of Americans subscribe to the anti-vaccination movement and hostility to the Covid-19 vaccines in particular has been stirred by right-wing media personalities and conspiracy theorists.\n",

      "(AFP Photo / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Save the Children said that even as some of the first wave of vaccines are currently being reserved for all countries, the governments of richer countries should not “hoard the limited initial supply” of available vaccines. Instead, these countries must ensure distribution based on needs and not on wealth.\n",
      "“Countries who can afford life-saving vaccines should not have access over countries who cannot – one life is not worth more than another,” said Save the Children Global Director for Health and Nutrition Kathryn Bolles.Bolles noted that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to infect hundreds of thousands of people every day, claiming more than 1.6 million lives so far across the globe.“That means children are losing their parents, family members, teachers, and health care workers, which is deeply impacting their lives and the lives of their families,” she said. “The economies they live in are hard hit, pushing them into poverty. It’s unfair that some poorer countries must wait months or possibly longer for the vaccine,” she added.\n",
      "When the COVID-19 outbreak started, Bolles said that there were global commitments that people in lower and middle income countries should have equal access to any vaccine — but “it seems that notion has shifted”\n",
      "Bolles said that wealthier governments should not choose nationalism but instead uphold the spirit of equitable global access, including supporting COVAX to urgently provide support to ensure people around the world are vaccinated. As thousands of people continue to die every day from COVID-19, and hundreds of thousands more are infected, time is of the essence, she added.\n",
      "“Governments must commit to expanding the supply, access and availability of vaccines, and all involved need to support the sharing of COVID-19 data and technology by committing to C-TAP, the COVID-19 technology access pool,” Bolles said. “Investment and collaboration with vaccine manufacturers in developing countries should also be prioritized to unleash supply to local and regional populations.”\n",
      "Bolles noted that while it is understandable that it will be difficult to ensure equal access to the initial supply of vaccines, but “governments must do what they can to make sure it’s as fair as possible and not further accelerate the huge global inequities we face today.”\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic, Bolles said, has stressed that “our own protection is rooted in the protection of others – no one safe until everyone is safe.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "In an interview aired over CNN Philippines, Foreign Affairs SecretaryTeodoro Locsin Jr. revealed Monday the country may secure the deal before year ends, citing that the information came from the Serum Institute of India, currently the world’s largest vaccine producer.“Thirty million dosages of the Indian-made Novavax vaccines are assured possibly with no cash advance which will be available by July 2021,” he said.\n",

With this agreement, Novavax increases its manufacturing capacity of NVX-CoV2373 to over two billion doses annually.Locsin also said COVID-19 policy chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. will start negotiations with medical biotech company Moderna “on or before” Wednesday next week.Aside from the two companies, the Foreign Affairs chief had earlier said that United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is committed to help the Philippines in securing COVID-19 vaccines from American drugmaker Pfizer following an alleged botched deal involving Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.\n",
      "He said the country has so far secured 2.6 million doses from British drugmaker AstraZeneca through the help of the private sector.Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) announced Monday that the Philippines can secure money for advance financing for vaccine purchases of up to 50 percent, as well as retroactive financing of up to 30 percent if the government has earlier made a downpayment for vaccines.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Once the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available in the region, Juanico said the first ones to be vaccinated will be frontline health workers. These would include doctors, nurses and other medical staff of hospitals and medical facilities, who have direct contact with those who tested positive for COVID-19.\n",
      "In the same manner, senior citizens and the indigents will also be among the top priority for the COVID-19 vaccinations.\n",
      "Second to be prioritized for the COVID-19 vaccine will be those working in barangay (village) or town health facilities, including barangay health workers.Third in the COVID-19 vaccine priority list will be workers for national government agencies, who have been augmenting services for COVID-19 responses both with the DOH and local government units.Included in this category are personnel of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), Office of Civil Defense (OCD), Department of Education (DepEd), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP).

      "Agriculture Secretary William Dar admitted that farmers are not a priority in the government-led distribution of COVID-19 vaccine, but vowed to look for vaccines for the agriculture sector where players are also considered frontliners.\n",
      "“The priority right now are frontliners [but] mostly medical, soldiers, police, and senior citizens,” Dar said when asked in a virtual briefing if farmers will also receive the vaccine once the government finally sealed a deal with providers.\n",
      "Farm workers thresh rice during a harvest, in the barangay of Palattao, in Naguilian, Isabela province, the Philippines. Photographer: Nana Buxani/Bloomberg file photo\n",
      "Dar assured that the Department of Agriculture (DA) will continuously coordinate with the private sector, mentioning Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion, so that farmers will also be given priority in future mass COVID-19 vaccination.Since the start of the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, DA has repetitively appealed to local government units (LGU) to consider farmers, fishermen, and other personnel, directly and indirectly, working in food production as COVID-19 frontliners.\n",
      "This, so that they should be allowed entry through checkpoints amid strict lockdown restrictions. In the end, despite logistical issues, farmers and fishermen were still able to deliver, saving the Philippines from the risk of facing a food shortage amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that from July to September, farm sector’s production grew by 0.7 percent. During the quarter, increases in production were noted for crops and fisheries, while livestock and poultry posted reductions in outputs. At current prices, the value of agricultural production grew by 4.1 percent to P404.6 billion from the previous year’s level of P388.5 billion.As the country works towards securing vaccines for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) stressed that the distribution of these vaccines must be made equitable and accessible to everyone, an earlier report in Manila Bulletin showed.CHR Commissioner Gwen Pimentel-Gana said this a few weeks after developed countries such as the United States and United Kingdom and their pharmaceutical companies – Pfizer, Moderna, and Astra Zeneca – have already announced their success with the vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic, which are now awaiting final stage trials.\n",
      "Pimentel-Gana emphasized that the preservation of life is a fundamental human right, so global leaders must address the distribution with “ethical solutions” that reflect the principles of human rights, universality, and equity.\n",
      "She said that every human being must be given the vaccine regardless of their race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.\n",
      "While developed countries will undoubtedly prioritize vaccinating their citizens, the CHR said that they should also keep in mind that less-developed countries also need their help.\n",

      "While many people are skeptical about the COVID vaccine, nurse Riza Raquion believes that it is the only way to end the pandemic and slowly put people’s lives back to normal.\n",
      "Richie Gil, a critical care nurse who is married to a nurse, said: ‘I have long been waiting for this moment to come after enduring 10 months of risking our lives being exposed to COVID-19 patients.\n",
      "Gil and his wife availed of the early vaccination to protect their three young children and aging in-laws. Leo Quijano, a nurse in the UK, who received the injection a day after it was rolled out by the UK government, said: ‘Being a victim of COVID-19 myself, I did not hesitate. I am positive about the vaccine which has shown 95 percent efficacy in the study and that is really good.”In the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic are brave Filipino healthcare workers, many of them working in critical hospital wards abroad.They are witnessing at first hand the viciousness of the coronavirus disease that has already claimed the lives of nearly 1.7 million people and infected more than 76.1 million others worldwide.\n",
      "Just as the United Kingdom and the United States recently rolled out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use to address their spiraling cases, several Filipino healthcare workers in both countries volunteered to get the first dose of the vaccine amid skepticism on its efficacy and possible side effects. RIZA RAQUION, Registered Nurse, Chicago\n",
      "“It’s my duty as a health care provider to be a good example to protect my patient, my family and my community,” said the 53-year-old Riza Raquion. She was administered with the vaccine on December 18 at the Amita Health Resurrection Medical Center in Chicago where she works as a registered nurse.\n",
      "When Raquion heard the news from the hospital that they will begin to roll out the vaccine, “I immediately prepared myself mentally,” she told the Manila Bulletin in an online interview on Sunday.\n",

      "“When you work at the hospital bedside as a nurse, you will see the struggle. You will see how they (COVID patients) cope to get better. It’s very hard and I’ve seen them. It breaks my heart to take care of these patients and I don’t want them to die in front of me again. I’ve witnessed it and it’s so depressing. You’ll cry when you see them intubated, when you see them transferred to the ICU,” said Raquion, a mother of two boys.Even her 20-year-old son was not spared from the scourge of the pandemic. Raquion said her son is now under home isolation after contracting the virus only last Friday, presumably after going out to help a friend to do an errand. She was thankful that he only manifested “mild symptoms” of fever and headache for two days, while his temperature and oxygen saturation are now back to the normal level. She compared her COVID vaccination to flu shots “which I think hurts more.” After the injection, Raquion only noticed “soreness” in her left arm that easily went away the following day. “Now I’m feeling okay, no body ache, no other symptoms, no headache, no nausea, no vomiting.”\n",

      "“Don’t be afraid to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This is the only way to protect your loved ones, the community, and yourself to fight the virus if you’re exposed,” Raquion said, even as she warned that even with the vaccine, people should not let their guard down by continuing to observe basic health protocols such as the wearing of mask and face shield in public, social distancing, and proper handwashing.\n",
      "RICHIE GIL, Critical Care Nurse, Chicago\n",

      "A native of Dueñas, Iloilo, Gil migrated to the Windy City in 1994 and married Jeannie Segovia, a first-generation Filipina who is also a nurse at Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago. Since he is currently assigned at the Peri-operative services and Post Anesthesia Care Unit, considered as one of the COVID-19 battlefronts for medical frontliners, Gil was among those prioritized to receive the first wave of the vaccines allotted for the State of Illinois and City of Chicago.“I have long been waiting for this moment to come after enduring 10 months of risking our lives being exposed to COVID-19 patients. The daily uncertainty made me and my wife, who is also a nurse, accept the fact that it is just a matter of time before we get infected,” Gil said in an online interview.\n",
      "He admitted that several friends, co-workers, and family members were among the close to 300,000 American lives lost since the pandemic hit the United States early this year.Gil said he and his wife were compelled to avail of an early vaccination to protect their three young children and his aging in-laws. Gil received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on December 17, 2020, ahead of his wife who is just waiting for her turn at the medical facility where she is working.\n",
      "Even before the approval for emergency use was announced, Gil said most of the hospitals in the US had prepared and created a system leading to the vaccination, along with information about the selected vaccine to be administered.Despite that, Gil said not all of his co-workers are eager to be included in the first wave.“There was skepticism about the unknown side effects that this novel vaccine might cause where some are just waiting until others were vaccinated first… Even some Filipino nurses I know declined to take the first shot,” he added.\n",
      "Gil maintained that he was not nervous at all the moment the needle of the vaccine injection pierced through his skin.“I stopped momentarily to remember those who didn’t live to see the glory of that moment. I remembered all those who fell victim to this pandemic and the agony their family had to endure. I was full of hope the souls of our loved ones find solace and consolation that their death and their memory strengthened the resolve to produce this vaccine that will provide protection and eventually bring healing to humanity,” he said. LEO QUIJANO, Nurse, England\n",
      "At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe in May this year, Leo Quijano, a Filipino nurse working in one of the major hospitals in Brighton, England, had tested positive for COVID-19. Quijano surmised she contracted the virus from one of the patients. Two days later, the same patient died due to COVID-19 infections.Filipino Nurse Leo Quijano receives the first dose of the Pfizer-made vaccine at a hospital in the City of Brighton in England on December 9, 2020. She was one of the first Filipino health care workers in the world to get the vaccine out of the clinical trial phase.It was also about that period when Quijano began experiencing COVID-like symptoms such as fatigue, dehydration, and off and on fever.Quijano went into isolation for seven days and returned to work for three consecutive days. On the third day, Quijano decided to go home early after feeling too tired and exhausted and then again went into isolation for another two weeks until the situation got worst.On June 1, Quijano’s COVID test yielded positive and she was hastily placed at the hospital’s Red Zone, the dreaded isolation area for COVID-19 patients. While Quijano was lucky enough to have recovered from the bout with COVID-19, she was not able to work for two straight months.\n",
      "When the UK government announced the rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Quijano was among the first Filipino health workers in the UK to avail of the vaccine.“Being a victim of COVID-19 myself, I did not hesitate. I am positive about the vaccine which has shown 95 percent efficacy in the study and that is really good,” said Quijano who received the injection on December 8, a day after it was rolled out by the UK government.Despite the staggering number of COVID-19 cases in the UK, Quijano admits that some of her colleagues are still hesitant to be vaccinated.\n",
      "“Some are even joking that they want to see first what will happen to me in the next few months. All I can say is that we’ve been waiting for this and it’s already here,” she said.\n",
      "Quijano observed that the vaccination in the UK seems to be gaining ground, citing the sudden increase in the number of healthcare workers and elderly folks accessing the online booking platform.\n",
      "“I noticed that the schedule is already fully-booked in the next few weeks,” Quijano said.Nurse Leo Quijano, one of the first Filipino health care workers to receive the Pfizer vaccine, is shown at work in a hospital in Brighton, England\n",
      "In a recent webinar hosted by the Quezon City government, Quijano assured the participants that she is more than happy to share his experience with the Filipino people and help in the advocacy for the use of a safe and reliable vaccine in the Philippines.\n",
      "“Huwag po kayo matakot (Don’t be afraid). I hope it will be made available in the Philippines soon so that you will be protected and we can all normally function just like before the pandemic. But still, the key is prevention, we still need to observe the basic health protocols,” Quijano said. The Pfizer-BioNTech product, like other vaccines, will help the body to create the antibodies that destroy SARS-CoV2, the respiratory virus that causes COVID-19. This type of vaccine is made from a special RNA vaccine where one has to have two injections separated by three weeks to one month apart, with 95 percent effectiveness.

      "But she said she will not comment on the recent issue among Sen. Panfilo Lacson, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manual Romualdez, and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.\n",
      "“I do not like to blame anyone because I don’t know the whole story. There are many sides of the coin,” Robredo said during her weekly radio show, but added that she has heard Duque and Secretary Carlito Galvez, the country’s COVID-19 vaccine czar, denying that there was a failure to procure vaccines from Pfizer as early as January.Locsin had earlier said that somebody “dropped the ball” on the negotiations with Pfizer that will supposedly deliver 10 million vaccines to the country by January. Lacson named Duque as the one who failed to secure the agreement.\n",
      "Robredo lamented that the more people hear about the start of the inoculation of the vaccine in other countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, they fear that it may not take long to reach the Philippines.\n",
      "Although the government has repeatedly said that vaccines will be available in March, some sectors and so-called studies are saying that the Philippines is farther down the list.\n",

      "“There is a lot of information coming in. But like what I always say, the government needs to have one voice because if there are different voices, that will add to the people’s fears,” Robredo said.“We need to exert effort to allay these fears and assure them (the people) that we will have access to the vaccines,” she added.\n",
      "The Vice President noted the public fears around the security and efficacy of the Sinovac, and said that these concerns will affect the people’s perception of getting inoculated.\n",
      "Robredo’s office has held briefings about the storage requirements of the vaccines, particularly the one by Pfizer which needs a -17 degrees Celsius deep-freezer storage.\n",
      "The Philippines, she said, doesn’t have such a facility for still unknown reasons.“It is better if we can clarify these issues. Who’s telling the truth? There are many concerns about the vaccines, so this controversy will not help gain public trust,” Robredo added.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Robredo also said Sunday that trolls have acknowledged her as the rightful winner for vice president in the 2016 national elections through the hashtag #NasaanAngBisePresidente (#Where is the Vice President).“First, they are acknowledging that I am the Vice President. They refer to me as the fake VP, so the hashtag ‘Nasaan Ang Bise Presidente’ (Where is the Vice President) with my picture on it shows that I am the Vice President they are looking for,” Robredo said during her weekly radio show.The hashtag trended on social media amid the flashfloods in Mindanao from tropical depression “Vicky.” #NasaanAngBisePresidente was seemingly the trolls’ answer to the hashtag #NasaanAngPresidente that went viral during last month’s typhoons.\n",

      "(Photo by ERNESTO BENAVIDES / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Concepcion said Ayala Corp. confirmed 400,000 doses of vaccines, along with other companies such as Palawan Pawnshop which ordered 100,000 doses, Okada Manila – 40,000 doses, Uratex Philippines – 21,000 doses, Century Pacific Food – 20,000 doses, Unioil Petroleum Philippines Inc. – 20,000 doses, Golden Arches Development Corp. – 15,000 doses, and Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines Inc. – 10,000 doses. Each dose is still at its base cost of $5 (about ₱250).\n",
      "He said meetings with the European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, the British Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, the Entrepreneurs Organization, the Philippine Franchise Association, the Association of the Filipino Franchisers Inc., Philippine Ecozone Developers, Philippine Hotel Associations Inc., the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc., and George Barcelon of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry took place immediately after the purchase for the second batch of AstraZeneca vaccines was announced.“When they told me that, the number of calls and inquiries from the private sector were increasing. Although we expected it somehow, we were happy that more and more private sector partners are now taking their part in this initiative – ending the war against COVID-19. This only means that the business community is very serious in ensuring that our economy will remain open while slowly ending this war,” Concepcion stated, with more than 200 companies expressing their pledge and interest, and still counting.\n",
      "Recognizing the “bayanihan” spiritbeing created among the community, Concepcion extended his reach to help more businesses acquire their share of the vaccines in “A Dose of Hope.”\n",
      "Various business entities like microfinance institutions (MFIs) have been in contact with Go Negosyo and Concepcion.Allan Robert Sicat, executive director of the Microfinance Council of the Philippines Inc., has been connecting these networks of microfinance institutions to Go Negosyo and Concepcion.Dr. Jaime Aristotle Alip, founder and managing director of The Center for Agriculture and Rural Development Mutually Reinforcing Institutions, is one key advocate that is interested in the project.Leading a group of companies composed of a foundation, a bank, micro insurance, a development institute, and a business development service, Alip’s conglomerate is a critical source of assistance for MSMEs.\n",
      "Other advocates that expressed their interest in joining this cause are Fr. Jovic Lobrigo of Sedp Simbag sa Pag-asenso Inc. (SEDP Simbag) and Eduardo Jimenez of Kabalikat para sa Maunlad na Buhay Inc. (KMBI Inc).Concepcion, recently metthe Philippine Retailers Association headed by Rosemarie Ong, Senior Executive Vice President and COO of Wilcon Depot.“I shared with them that it’s important to vaccinate all the frontliners in the retail sector, supermarkets, department stores, and malls,” Concepcion said as a step in helping MSMEs bounce back.\n",
      "“The more businesses involved in this project, the faster the ecosystem will be revived, thus, stimulating exchange. It is one answer to the question of how we get money flowing again – it will stop the bleeding,” he added.\n",
      "“Two fronts kasi yan, both from the government side, they’re taking care of the public sector, kami naman sa private sector – teamwork kami. So, if we’re able to execute, mas madaling sagupain itong pandemya,” Concepcion said.\n",
      "“With the government mainly ensuring the welfare of the country through enabling and keeping safe our health frontliners, this initiative, Concepcion said, will ensure the welfare of our country through enabling and boosting our economic frontliners. Sa kapasidad namin, tutulong din kami. If the private sector will not help, the economy will remain restricted.”“MSMEs are one of the greatly affected in this pandemic. Right now, as some of their businesses are closed, they don’t have a cash flow. So now, this is why we want to really help, I think the real solution here is control the situation and control the infection, get rid of the virus – and this is only possible through the vaccine,” Concepcion said.\n",
      "“Many business organizations want to be in the second part, and this could be the last. Just look at it, the cost of testing using antigen is P500, RT-PCR, P2,500 and up. This is P500 for two doses, an offer from Astra from their zero profit program for 2021,”he said.\n",

      "The Swissmedic regulatory authority said it had given the green light following a two-month rolling review.\n",
      "Switzerland has been recording more than 4,000 new cases and 100 deaths every day. There have been a total of 400,000 infections and nearly 6,000 deaths since the pandemic began.“After a meticulous review of the available information, Swissmedic concluded that the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech is safe and that its benefit outweighs the risks,” Swissmedic said.\n",
      "Health Minister Alain Berset added: “We can start vaccinating in the coming days.“Those who are particularly vulnerable will have priority,” he said, referring to the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.\n",
      "These amount to some two million people in Switzerland, which has a population of 8.6 million.Produced by US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer and German biotechnology company BioNTech, the vaccine is based on a new technology that uses genetic material in the form of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid).\n",
      "“The level of protection afforded seven days after the second injection is over 90 percent in adults,” Swissmedic said of the data it reviewed.\n",
      "The regulator said the most frequently-documented side effects were “comparable with those after a flu vaccination”.\n",
      "– Curbs as infections rise –The Swiss army will receive, store and distribute the vaccine doses, which must be kept at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit).\n",

      "Basel city said it was ready to start vaccinations on December 28.\n",
      "Health minister Berset said the vaccine was not mandatory but was “strongly recommended” — and free of charge.\n",
      "The announcement came a day after the Swiss government said bars and restaurants would once again be closed across the country from Tuesday for at least a month.“The number of infections is very high and is continuing to rise. Hospitals and healthcare workers have been under extreme pressure for weeks and the festive period increases the risk of an even more rapid rise in cases,” it said.\n",

      "There had been a campaign by labs to show that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine was “inefficient or risked even being dangerous,” he said. But he insisted about “two billion people” take it “prophylactically for anti-malarial purposes around the world”.\n",

      "Senator Panfilo M. Lacson (SENATE OF THE PHILIPPINES / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Lacson also said there should be no room for incompetence and ineptitude, especially on the part of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, after the events last week.\n",
      "“My Christmas wish is simple. I hope we Filipinos survive this pandemic, and we get the needed vaccines soonest,” Lacson said in an interview on DWIZ radio.But he added the Cabinet, including vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., should help Duque not by defending him in media but by getting his job done.\n",
      "He said that if there was something good that came out of Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.’s tweet about someone ‘’dropping the ball’’ during the initial efforts to get vaccines, it was that the attention of those concerned had been called.\n",

      "Lacson noted Locsin and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke Friday night for the Philippines to procure COVID vaccines, even if it is just a fraction of the 10 million doses initially discussed.“This time, I expect Secretary Duque to be alert, and I expect the Cabinet members to help him move faster instead of defending him through statements to the media,’’ he said.\n",

      "(Just help him. Don’t explain your side through the media. Help do his work)He noted Duque had asked Galvez and other Cabinet members to defend him in the media, noting Duque was “practically frantic” in doing so.“Please don’t defend the indefensible,” Lacson advised Galvez, noting no less than President Duterte had told Duque to explain himself.“This is also not an issue of a ‘mission impossible’ of getting the vaccines by January. The issue is Duque’s negligence that more efficient bureaucracies like Singapore getting the vaccines ahead of us,” he added.As for Duque’s claim that he erred on the side of caution in signing the CDA late, Lacson said: “Caution, my foot. 118 days to sign a simple CDA, between June and October?” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "No bus was missed and nobody dropped the ball in the negotiations for COVID-19 vaccines from US biopharmaceutical giant Pfizer.\n",
      "Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 and the designated vaccine czar, stressed this Saturday as he finally addressed the controversies hounding the allegedly botched deal by the government with Pfizer.\n",
      "Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 (NTF AGAINST COVID-19 / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "In a “Laging Handa” press briefing, Galvez clarified that the negotiation by the government with Pfizer for the possible supply of COVID-19 vaccines “is still ongoing” and the signing of an agreement may happen this month or by January.“Nasa advance (stage) na tayo sa Pfizer so hinihintay na lang natin ang validation and coordination from Pfizer headquarters. Once magkaroon na ng talagang… kung ilan ang i-allocate sa atin, magkakaroon na ng pirmahan. Hopefully ang pinaka-earliest ay within this month or maybe kung may delay ‘yung allocation it will be first week of January (We are already in the advanced stage of negotiation with Pfizer so we are just waiting for the validation and coordination by the government with Pfizer headquarters. Once we already determine how many (doses) they are willing to allocate to us, there will be a signing of an agreement. Hopefully, the earliest is within this month or first week of January (2021) if there is a delay in the allocation),” he said.\n",
      "The controversy stemmed from the revelation of Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.last week that the plan to secure Pfizer’s vaccine by January was foiled after “someone dropped the ball” during the negotiations. He did not drop any names.\n",
      "But Sen. Panfilo Lacson bared that Locsin was referring to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III after Duquesupposedly failed to submit “on time” a confidentiality disclosure agreement (CDA) to Pfizer.The CDA will ensure that some critical information about Pfizer’s vaccines will not be divulged to the public while certain evaluation processes are still ongoing.Galvez defended Duque from criticisms that his supposed negligence led to the fallout of the government and Pfizer’s negotiations which, according to the vaccine czar, started in the middle part of the year.\n",
      "Galvez bared that the government has been talking with Pfizer as early as August or September for the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines but there were some “roadblocks” that were encountered by both parties.\n",
      "Among the roadblocks were the lack of data about the efficacy of Pfizer at the time and the need to store the vaccine in extremely cold temperatures.“Noong panahon na iyon, maraming uncertainties kasi ‘yung platform ng Pfizer ay hindi pa ginagamit sa mga vaccine. ‘Yun ang block at napakataas ng requirement sa logistics (During that time, there were a lot of uncertainties because the platform of Pfizer was not yet used in the vaccines. That was the roadblock and the high requirements in the logistics),” Galvez said.\n",
      "“‘Yung nangyayaring negotiation sa Pfizer ay ongoing po at hindi po tayo bumitaw. Hindi po natin nabitawan ang bola kundi ipinasa lang sa akin (The negotiation with Pfizer is currently ongoing and we did not let go. Nobody dropped the ball but it was passed to me),” he added.\n",
      "Galvez urged all stakeholders to stop making “unfounded accusations and unnecessary noise” which may derail the government from pursuing its goal of securing a safe and effective vaccine.\n",
      "“The ball is being passed not because there are those who are abrogating responsibility but because we want it to reach the goal – to close deals and obtain vaccines for all Filipinos so that we can implement our national vaccination program at the most appropriate time,” he said.\n",
      "Pfizer is at the forefront of the vaccine race as it reported that its candidate vaccine yielded 95-percent efficacy in its Phase 3 trials. The United States government already issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Pfizer to allow its vaccine to be used for public consumption.Galvez assured that the government is “determined” to acquire safe and effective vaccines for all Filipinos “regardless of brand or their country of origin.”The government is planning to inoculate 60 to 70 percent of the total population, or about 70 million Filipinos, to achieve herd immunity and as part of the National Vaccine Roadmap to eradicate the threat of COVID-19.\n",
      "“With this as our guiding principle, it is our duty as public servants to carefully study and evaluate all documents relative to the procurement and acquisition of candidate vaccines, especially when the public health and safety are at stake. As we take responsibility for our actions, we cannot afford to engage in finger-pointing or buck-passing at this crucial stage. These kinds of discussions are unproductive and will only distract us from carrying out our crucial mandate,” he said.\n",
      "Galvez said all the decisions and actions that the government has made were done “in accordance with the careful process of scientific evaluation and selection” of the Vaccine Expert Panel (VEP), which evaluates the vaccine candidates that want to enter the country.\n",
      "“The process of selection is based on safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, the track record of the vaccine maker, complexity of handling and logistics, after-sales and life cycle services, production capacity and early delivery, and long-term commitment,” he said. “Let me reiterate, no ‘bus’ was missed or no ‘ball’ was dropped because we are focused on our main goal and that is to secure an equitable share of the vaccines,” he added.

      "Several senior US officials including Vice President Mike Pence got early Covid-19 vaccinations Friday, contrasting with Europe, where two leaders were quarantining after testing positive and EU regulators have yet to approve a vaccine.\n",
      "Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston administered the first of its Covid-19 vaccinations to its employees on Tuesday, with registered nurse Belza Betancur receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The coronavirus pandemic has killed at least 1.66 million people and infected more than 74 million worldwide. (Massachusetts General Hospital / AFP)\n",
      "Pence’s public inoculation against the coronavirus was the most high-profile attempt yet at persuading vaccine-skeptic Americans to join a massive national effort to halt a pandemic that has killed at least 1.66 million people and infected more than 74 million worldwide.\n",
      "Also getting their shots were House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office on January 20, announced he would take the vaccine, also in public, on Monday.\n",
      "Yet in hard-hit Europe, unease mounted after Slovakia’s 47-year-old Prime Minister Igor Matovic tested positive Friday for Covid-19 a week after attending a European Union summit in Brussels.\n",
      "The summit is believed to be where French President Emmanuel Macron caught the virus — the announcement of his diagnosis a day earlier led a host of European leaders and top French officials to rush into self-isolation.\n",
      "Macron acknowledged Friday he had been “slowed down” by his infection, but insisted he was doing well and still actively involved in “priority” government business including Brexit trade talks.US President Donald Trump, who has been a longtime skeptic about the seriousness of the pandemic, wished Macron “a speedy recovery,” the White House said.\n",
      "Elsewhere, world leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are also pledging to get public injections in order to boost confidence in the vaccines.\n",
      "The first wave of vaccinations in the United States, where more than 310,000 Americans have died, are using the Pfizer/BioNTech drug.Another vaccine, made by Moderna, is now expected to become the second shot allowed in a Western country after a panel of US experts recommended emergency use approval.\n",
      "Trump was notably absent from Pence’s vaccination event.\n",
      "But he has been eager to take credit for record-fast vaccine breakthroughs, and he sparked confusion Friday when he jumped the gun to declare Moderna approved, ahead of a final verdict from the Food and Drug Administration.\n",
      "“Distribution to start immediately,” Trump tweeted.– Two billion doses –\n",
      "The European Union faces pressure to approve vaccines after Britain and the United States have already administered tens of thousands of shots, while China and Russia have launched efforts with domestically produced vaccines. \n",
      "The bloc intends to begin its inoculations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine before the end of the year, with some countries naming December 27 as a start date.\n",
      "Poorer countries also got a boost Friday when the World Health Organization and partners said vaccines would be distributed early next year to the 190 countries in its Covax initiative, a pooling effort formed to ensure an equitable distribution.“The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference.\n",

      "On Friday, the iconic Washington Monument was temporarily closed after Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who has reportedly been giving private tours to his associates, tested positive.\n",
      "Europe is still in the throes of a winter surge that has caused almost 37,000 deaths over the past seven days, the highest weekly toll since the start of the pandemic.\n",
      "Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, on Friday announced a new month-long lockdown starting December 26 in response to a wave of infections.\n",
      "And Sweden announced a U-turn on face masks, recommending that they be worn on public transport at peak times, having previously resisted their use in the fight against Covid-19 except in health care.\n",
      "In South Africa, Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize signaled the detection of a severe coronavirus variant that could explain the rapid spread of a second wave of cases.\n",
      "Latin America is also seeing hard days, with Brazil and Mexico logging the highest number of new deaths after the United States.\n",
      "Mexico City’s mayor announced that the capital and neighboring state would suspend almost all activities from this weekend as virus cases rise — allowing only such essentials as the sale of food, energy, transport, manufacturing and financial services.\n",
      "But in Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro — who has systemically downplayed the coronavirus — continued to undermine the country’s own immunization campaign, this time with the outlandish suggestion that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could turn people into “crocodiles” or “bearded ladies.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in November’s presidential elections and is due to take office in January, hailed the news as “another milestone” in the fight against the virus.\n",
      "But he also warned of “the immense challenges ahead, including scaling up manufacturing, distribution, and the monumental task of vaccinating hundreds of millions of Americans.”\n",
      "The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved by Britain on December 2, followed by several other countries including the US last week. Less-vetted shots have also been rolled out in China and Russia.The United States alone has seen more than 310,000 people die from coronavirus infections and is in the midst of a brutal winter surge, with nearly 115,000 people hospitalized, according to the Covid Tracking Project.\n",
      "Cutting-edge technology\n",
      "Moderna has several other drugs under development, but has never before seen any authorized.\n",
      "The decade-old, Massachusetts-based biotech company received $2.5 billion in federal funding for its efforts and co-developed the vaccine with scientists at the National Institutes of Health.\n",
      "Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are based on cutting-edge mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology, and both have been shown to be highly effective, protecting about 95 percent of people against Covid-19 compared to a placebo.\n",
      "They have also been found to have no serious safety issues in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people each.\n",
      "The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes in the same arm as the injection, nausea and vomiting, and fever.\n",
      "But there have now been a handful of people around the world who developed significant allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, and the FDA has said it will remain vigilant in its monitoring.\n",
      "Both vaccines come with warnings for people who have histories of allergic reactions to their ingredients.\n",
      "FDA scientist Peter Marks told reporters that the total number of cases of allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine across the United States was now around five.\n",
      "He said investigations were underway, and suggested the culprit might be an ingredient called polyethylene glycol, which is in both vaccines.\n",
      "The FDA will also be on the lookout to see whether both vaccines may in extremely rare cases be linked to Bell’s palsy, a temporary facial paralysis condition, a handful of cases of which emerged during clinical trials.\n",
      "Placebo dilemma\n",
      "Both of the vaccines work by giving human cells the instructions to make a surface protein of the coronavirus, which simulates an infection and trains the immune system for when it encounters the real virus.\n",
      "They each differ in the formulation of the fatty particles used to deliver the mRNA, which allows Moderna’s vaccine to be kept in long term storage at -20 degrees Celsius, unlike Pfizer’s, which must be stored at -90 degrees Celsius.\n",
      "Moderna carried out a clinical trial of more than 30,000 people, roughly half of whom were given the product and the other half a placebo, with neither recipients nor their health care providers knowing who was in each group.It has proposed to “unblind” the whole study and offer placebo recipients the vaccine, a plan criticized by some experts who say scientists will be deprived of valuable data, and some people will end up getting the vaccine ahead of others in their priority group.\n",

      "Senator Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan (Photo from Kiko Pangilinan website / kikopangilinan.com / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "However, Pangilinan warned that the “slow” bureaucratic process could derail the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program since he believes that the country could even shore up additional funds to finance it.\n",
      "“Hindi pera ang problema; bureakrasya ang problema (Money is not the problem; bureaucracy is the problem),” he said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel.Under the 2021 general appropriations, a total of P72.5 billion was appropriated for the purchase and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, P2.5 billion of which was allocated to the Department of Health, while P70 billion was lodged under the unprogrammed appropriations.\n",
      "Another P10 billion has been set aside for vaccine purchase under the “Bayanihan to Recover as One” or Bayanihan 2 Act.\n",
      "Besides the budget provided by Congress, Pangilinan recalled learning during their debates in the Senate that “we have anywhere between P800 billion to P900 billion in cash.”\n",
      "He said billions of government funds remain unspent due to the slow release and utilization by agencies in the Executive department, prompting the lawmakers to extend the validity of the 2020 budget and the Bayanihan 2.\n",
      "“Bilyong-bilyong halaga ng pera ang hindi nagagamit dahil mabagal, may burokrasya ng Executive department. Kung hindi natin in-extend, eh babalik sa national treasury, na kinakailangan nating gastusin dahil ‘yon ang hinahanap ng ating mga kababayan (Billions worth of money are not being spent because of the slow, excessive bureaucracy in the Executive department. If we did not extend it, the unused funds will be reverted to the national treasury, when we badly need to spend it because these are what our people need),” he said.“We are facing the worst economic crisis since World War 2, sabi ng mga (according to) experts. We are facing the worst crisis, siguro (maybe), in a hundred years, and therefore, hindi katanggap-tanggap na sa gitna ng ganitong mga pangangailangan na gastusin para makatulong ay mabagal at makupad ang pagrelease ng pondo (It is unacceptable that despite the need for such government spending to help our people, there is a slow release of funds),” he added.\n",

      "The Senate Committee of the Whole is set to conduct an inquiry into the government’s game plan in purchasing and distributing COVID-19 vaccines to the country’s population.“The Senate would like to step in and, try to, precisely, help put some direction and coordination in the vaccine rollout, which is critical,” Pangilinan said.Sen. Panfilo Lacson had claimed that Health Secretary Franciso Duque “dropped the ball” in the procurement of coronavirus vaccines from United States-based Pfizer. Duque denied the claim.

      "FDA cautions public against unregistered vaccinesTwo more US biotech companies have expressed willingness to supply the Philippines with COVID-19 vaccines, Philippine Ambassador to the US Babes Romualdez said on Friday.This file photo taken on November 18, 2020 shows a bottle reading “Vaccine Covid-19” next to the Moderna biotech company logo.\n",
      "(Photo by JOEL SAGET / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Aside from Pfizer, Romualdez said Moderna and Arcturus are “ready to supply” around four to 25 million of their respective COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines by the third quarter of 2021 should the government “find their proposals acceptable.”“We are hoping our government will consider the promising candidates of Moderna and Arcturus for inclusion in our country’s pool of anti-COVID vaccines,” Romualdez said.\n",
      "Arcturus’ COVID candidate ARCT021 was developed with the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.ARCT021 uses a messenger RNA (mRNA) technology like the vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer.The vaccine is currently in its Phase I/II trial, according to a report by CNBC.Moderna, on the other hand, has been recommended for emergency approval in the United States by its panel of experts.\n",
      "Romualdez said the country’s procurement of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer is still “in progress.”Unregistered vaccinesAs this developed, the Department of Health (DOH) warned the public Friday not to take COVID-19 vaccines that are unregistered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as it “could do more harm than good.”“We would like to warn and advise the public that when you use unregistered or unauthorized vaccines, we cannot guarantee its safety or if it will be efficacious… this may cause more harm than good,” said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.\n",

      "A US panel of experts on Thursday voted to recommend emergency approval of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for six million doses to start shipping as soon as this weekend.\n",
      "The Food and Drug Administration is now expected to imminently grant an emergency use authorization (EUA), which would make Moderna’s vaccine the second to be approved in a Western country.\n",
      "This file photo taken on November 18, 2020 shows a bottle reading “Vaccine Covid-19” next to the Moderna biotech company logo.\n",
      "(Photo by JOEL SAGET / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The panel voted 20 in favor, none against, with one abstention.They had been asked to answer the question: “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?”\n",
      "Epidemiologist Arnold Monto, who chaired the live-streamed discussion, said nothing should be read into the fact that the vote was even more overwhelming than last week’s in favor of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\n",
      "“Academics have a way of getting involved in details, and what we have done for the last eight or nine hours was to go over the details,” he said.\n",
      "The meeting came as the number of deaths from the coronavirus quickly approaches 310,000 in the worst-hit country in the world, which this week began vaccinating health care workers and long-term care residents with the Pfizer vaccine.Both of these frontrunners are based on cutting-edge mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology, which had never been approved prior to the pandemic, and both are two-dose regimens.\n",
      "Though the level of protection against Covid-19 for both is around 95 percent — far greater than experts had thought was possible — there have now been a handful of people around the world who developed significant allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.\n",
      "The US, which has recorded more than 17 million cases of the virus, will probably become the first country to approve the Moderna vaccine.The small Massachusetts-based biotech firm teamed up with scientists from the US National Institutes of Health on the product and has received more than $2.5 billion from the US government for its efforts.\n",
      "Protection against infection\n",
      "A clinical trial of 30,400 people found it was 94.1 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 compared to a placebo, performing slightly better in younger adults compared to the elderly.\n",
      "Jacqueline Miller, Moderna’s vice president of infectious diseases development, said Thursday that there was a strong suggestion the vaccine also protected most people against infection, which is important from a public health perspective as it would prevent onward transmission.\n",
      "An FDA review of all available data found there were “no specific safety concerns identified.”\n",
      "But on Thursday, FDA official Doran Fink said that should an EUA be granted, the agency would issue a beefed-up warning label regarding potential allergic reactions.This comes after two health care workers in Alaska had such reactions to the Pfizer vaccine, and one of them was hospitalized. Two health workers in the UK also had allergic reactions.\n",
      "Placebo dilemma\n",
      "Moderna was criticized by Stanford expert Steven Goodman because of its plans to offer the vaccine to participants in its trial who received the placebo, even before it would normally be available to their demographic group.\n",
      "This would deprive the trial of a control group and reduce the quality of data that could be gleaned from it, plus set a bad precedent for future trials, he said.\n",
      "But Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, defended the proposal.\n",
      "“None of our trial participants would be ‘jumping the line’ ahead of others, because we have clinical trial supplies that in fact would expire and go to waste,” he said, adding many participants were at high-risk, and one person on the placebo group had died from severe Covid-19.\n",
      "The most common side effects associated with the drug, called mRNA-1273, were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain and chills.\n",
      "Few of these effects were classed as “severe.”\n",
      "Allergic reactions occurred in 1.5 of the vaccinated population compared to 1.1 percent of the non-vaccinated, but none were classed as severe.\n",
      "To date, there have been three reports of Bell’s palsy — a facial paralysis condition, most often temporary — in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group.\n",
      "The FDA said there was insufficient information to determine that either vaccine was the cause but will continue monitoring. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Thursday there was no promise from Pfizer that it will provide the Philippines with 10 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine next month.\n",
      "Health Secretary Francisco Duque III (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "In an interview with CNN Philippines, Duque said the US-based pharmaceutical company did not give a “definitive” number of vaccine supply for the Philippines in their previous discussions.\n",
      "“Walang ganon (There was no promise). It was all indicative numbers there was no definitive supply because…in the production of these vaccines as we are talking…meron daw problema sa kanilang raw materials (they are having problems with regard to their raw materials)…there was nothing binding, nothing in our talks so this was all open-ended,” Duque said when asked if Pfizer ever promised to give the country 10 million doses of its vaccine by January.Earlier, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said he and Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez were able to secure 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine with the help of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo until “somebody dropped the ball.”\n",
      "While Locsin did not disclose the name of the person he was referring to, Sen. Panfilo Lacson said it was Duque who “dropped the ball.”\n",
      "Lacson, who had a phone conversation with Romualdez, said the Health Secretary failed to prepare the confidential disclosure agreement (CDA) which was one of the requirements for the procurement of the vaccines.\n",
      "Duque defended himself from accusations that he did not act quick enough on the matter.“We go through a process and when you go through a process, you can’t just be hurrying up things just like that. You have to be prudent and cautious, especially because you are talking about a brand new, a novel vaccine,” Duque said.\n",
      "“Not only is this a novel vaccine, but the technology that it is using, the mRNA platform is also new, never been tried or tested,” he added.\n",
      "Duque said that is it his overriding principle as a medical professional and a physican to “air on the side of caution.”The Health Secretary also said that it was only on Aug. 11 when Pfizer sent a draft of the CDA, which was initially meant to be signed by Executive Secretary (ES) Salvador Medialdea representing the Office of the President (OP) on behalf of all the government agencies.\n",
      "On Sept. 24, Duque said the Department of Health was advised by the OP that it will be the signatory to the CDA instead and requested the agency to hold a cooridnation meeting with Pfizer.\n",
      "The following day, Sept. 25, Duque said the DoH had an alignment meeting with Pfizer on the matter, since Pfizer initially requested the OP to sign the CDA.\n",
      "On Oct. 20. Duque said he signed the CDA.\n",
      "When asked why it took him three weeks to sign the CDA, Duque said: “May mga provisions na di kami nag kakasundo (There were provisions which we did not agree upon).”“May alteration (There was alteration), the process of going back and forth until when I asked the Deputy Excutive Secreatry Michael Ong on the day I was going to sign it, sabi ko ito yung provision na medyo (I told him about the provision that) I have some discomfort, but he said it’s your judgment call,” Duque said.\n",
      "“So I put my life in the line for this because I was thinking dapat siguro (maybe) after some time, baka naman itong bakuna na ito (maybe this vaccine) would prove effective…so that was my judgment call,” he added.\n",
      "As for why the OES deicded to pass on the signing of the CDA to the DoH, Duque said: “The vaccine is health related it is directly aligned to the mandete of the DoH. That reason is well grounded.”\n",
      "Duque reiterated that government needs to be cautious on procuring vaccines, especially new ones since it already had a “wrong expericence” about vaccines in the past.\n",
      "“We don’t want a repeat of such already costly lessons we have expiernced in the past with some of the vaccines because this is new. I think the ES was well aware that we had to proceed with caution and really get a lot more independent information with regard to this new vaccine,” he said.\n",
      "“We cannot just buy the vaccines like we’re buying a box of chocolate,” he said.\n",
      "While CDA is technically not a contract for purchase, Duque said he has to examine the document with caution to make sure that it will not distract the government.\n",
      "“I have to be very very cautious about what I am signing, ensuring that the government interest will be first and foremost protected, that there would be no onerous provision. I had to depend on my legal team to give me proper advice,” he said.\n",

      "Hungarian-born scientist Katalin Kariko’s obsession with researching a substance called mRNA to fight disease once cost her a faculty position at a prestigious US university, which dismissed the idea as a dead end.\n",
      "Katalin Kariko spent much of the 1990s writing grant applications to fund her investigations into ‘messenger ribonucleic acid’ — genetic molecules that tell cells what proteins to make, essential to keeping our bodies alive and healthy\n",
      "Now, her pioneering work — which paved the way for the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines — could be what saves the world from a 100-year pandemic.\n",
      "“This is just kind of unbelievable,” she told AFP in a video call from her home in Philadelphia, adding she was unused to the attention after toiling for years in obscurity.It shows why “it’s important science should be supported on many levels.”\n",
      "Kariko, 65, spent much of the 1990s writing grant applications to fund her investigations into “messenger ribonucleic acid” — genetic molecules that tell cells what proteins to make, essential to keeping our bodies alive and healthy.She believed mRNA held the key to treating diseases where having more of the right kind of protein can help — like repairing the brain after a stroke.\n",
      "But the University of Pennsylvania, where Kariko was on track for a professorship, decided to pull the plug after the grant rejections piled up.\n",
      "“I was up for promotion, and then they just demoted me and expected that I would walk out the door,” she said.Kariko didn’t yet have a green card and needed a job to renew her visa. She also knew she wouldn’t be able to put her daughter through college without the hefty staff discount.\n",
      "She decided to persist as a lower-rung researcher, scraping by on a meager salary.It was a low point in her life and career, but “I just thought…you know, the (lab) bench is here, I just have to do better experiments,” she said.\n",
      "The experience shaped her philosophy for dealing with adversity in every aspect of life.\n",
      "“Think through and then at the end of it, you have to say ‘What can I do?’“Because then you don’t waste your life.”\n",
      "The determination runs in the family — her daughter Susan Francia did go to Penn, where she earned a Master’s degree, and won gold medals with the US Olympic rowing team in 2008 and 2012.\n",
      "– Twin breakthroughs –\n",
      "Inside the body, mRNA delivers to cells the instructions stored in DNA, the molecules that carry all our genetic code.\n",
      "By the late 1980s, much of the scientific community was focused on using DNA to deliver gene therapy, but Kariko believed that mRNA was also promising since most diseases are not hereditary and don’t need solutions that permanently alter our genetics.\n",
      "First though, she had to overcome a major problem: in animal experiments, synthetic mRNA was causing a massive inflammatory response as the immune system sensed an invader and rushed to fight it.\n",
      "Kariko, together with her main collaborator Drew Weissman, discovered that one of the four building blocks of the synthetic mRNA was at fault — and they could overcome the problem by swapping it out with a modified version.\n",
      "They published a paper on the breakthrough in 2005. Then, in 2015, they found a new way to deliver mRNA into mice, using a fatty coating called “lipid nanoparticles” that prevent the mRNA from degrading, and help place it inside the right part of cells.\n",
      "Both these innovations were key to the Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, where Kariko is now a senior vice president, as well as the shots produced by Moderna.\n",
      "Both work by giving human cells the instructions to make a surface protein of the coronavirus, which simulates an infection and trains the immune system for when it encounters the real virus.\n",
      "– New treatments –\n",
      "The mRNA quickly degrades and the instructions it gives the body aren’t permanent, making the technology an ideal platform for a variety of applications, said Kariko.\n",

      "France will receive around 1.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by year end, Prime Minister Jean Castex said Wednesday, adding another 2.3 million will arrive in the next two months.\n",
      "The delivery of some 3.5 million doses will innoculate around 1.7 million people, with priority given to the elderly, the vulnerable and carers.\n",
      "Covid vaccines are administered in two doses over several weeks.The government will “be much more transparent in this phase of the epidemic’s management,” the premier pledged, after authorities came under fire over the distribution of tests and masks earlier in the year.\n",
      "“We should not miss this turn in the road” to inoculate people, he said.\n",
      "Giving a breakdown, Castex said France will receive around 1.16 million doses by the end of the year, another 677,000 doses around 5-6 January, and around 1.6 million doses in February.\n",
      "France has ordered a total of around 200 million doses, which would be enough to innoculate 100 million people. The country has a population of just under 70 million.Castex said that the start of the vaccine campaign was conditional on approval from the European Medicines Agency, expected on December 21.\n",
      "“It is only at the end of spring that we will open the vaccination programme to the entire population”, he added.\n",
      "Another problem for the French authorities is that according to an opinion poll, only 53 percent of people want to be vaccinated, among the lowest rates in the world.“We must remember that if a vaccine is authorised, it is only at the end of a rigorous procedure of tests and evaluations, both at the European and national levels,” Castex assured.\n",

      "Senator Pia S. Cayetano has filed a resolution calling for a Senate inquiry on the status of the country’s procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical supplies needed for inoculation, as well as the implementation of the country’s vaccination program against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n",
      "Sen. Pia Cayetano\n",
      "(Senate Public Relations & Information Bureau / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Cayetano’s Senate Resolution 597 filed last Monday stated that “[T]there is a need to review and examine our existing policies and programs to expedite the purchase of [COVID-19] vaccines and the necessary medical supplies to inoculate the desired number of the population, while ensuring that other health protocols necessary to deal with COVID-19 continue to be improved and implemented.’’\n",
      "The lady senator said “it is critical to monitor the status of the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and medical supplies as well as the implementation of a national COVID-19 vaccination program”, to effectively protect Filipinos’ health and help the country build back better.“[E]ven in the United States, there is much concern about rolling out the vaccine efficiently as it is not only an issue of coordination between the government, healthcare professionals, and healthcare systems but also the involvement of local clinics and the general population because a single misstep may lead to the disruption of the entire system,” the resolution added.\n",
      "Cayetano pointed out that while there are still vaccines undergoing trials, other nations have already secured enough by the end of 2021 for “nearly three times their current population.”\n",
      "“[T]he United States closed a deal with Pfizer as early as July for 100 million vials, and has recently bought another 100 million from Moderna, while Canada, with the population of 38 million, has agreed to buy up to 76 million doses from Pfizer, and 414 million from other vaccine manufacturers,” she noted through her resolution.\n",
      "Meanwhile, according to the National Task Force Against COVID-19, the Philippine government could secure advance procurement of the vaccines by the end of next year and get 30 to 50 million doses once they are rolled out.\n",
      "This, Cayetano cited, would cover only 14 to 23 percent of our population, despite the World Health Organization’s pronouncement that 60 to 70 percent of a country’s population need to acquire immunity to break the chain of transmission.\n",
      "Apart from COVID-19 vaccines, Cayetanosaid there are also other expenses that the government needs to prepare for to ensure the success of the country’s fight against the pandemic.\n",
      "During the plenary deliberations on the Department of Health’s proposed 2021 budget, Cayetano as Senior Vice Chairwoman of the Senate Finance Committee said the discussion and, consequently, the budgetary allocation should not be limited to the purchase of the vaccines.She pointed out that allocations for other components of the vaccination process – such as storage, training of vaccinators, transportation, waste disposal, health promotion, surveillance, medical supplies like syringes and needles, and other costs for the roll out of the vaccination program – must also be carefully taken into consideration.\n",
      "Cayetano stressed that another concern that should be taken into consideration is people’s willingness to be vaccinated.\n",
      "As such, she said an effective information campaign to properly educate the public on the importance of vaccines and the necessary funds for such are also essential.\n",
      "“Consideration for all these other components of the vaccination process should go together with our efforts to purchase the vaccines, to guarantee a more holistic approach in the next phase of our COVID-19 battle,” she added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "It was the “shot” that was seen and heard around the world. On Dec. 8, the first-ever approved Covid-19 vaccine was given to a 90-year-old woman in the UK named Maggie. This became the first of many more vaccinations, marking a momentous shift in the battle against Covid-19.\n",
      "The road to the Covid-19 vaccine was far from certain. Many doubted that a safe and effective vaccine could be produced in less than a year. The fastest time to develop a vaccine was four years. That was for the mumps vaccine. The preclinical and clinical studies encompassing phase 1 to phase 3 clinical trials of vaccine development are daunting. As pointed out by many scientists, though, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not start from scratch. This was not a rushed process. This vaccine has been in development for the past 17 years.When the original SARS coronavirus epidemic occurred in 2002, there was a rush to identify its weak spots. One of its vulnerabilities is its spike protein, the little knobs that give the coronavirus its distinctive appearance. Spike protein enables the virus to attack and enter human cells. The 2002 SARS outbreak fortunately fizzled out, but this meant that no vaccines could be clinically evaluated. With no more active infections, vaccines could no longer be tested.\n",
      "A Covid 19 vaccine candidate at the Sinovac Biotech facilities in Beijing\n",
      "(Nicolas Asfouri)\n",
      "When MERS emerged in 2012, there was renewed interest in developing a coronavirus vaccine. A lot of the vaccine knowledge developed for SARS was utilized to develop a vaccine for MERS. Again, the outbreak ended before clinical trials could begin. There is still some low-level transmission occurring sporadically among camel handlers in Saudi Arabia, but these are not enough to properly evaluate a vaccine. The effort to prove efficacy in humans was shelved. The SARS outbreak followed by the MERS outbreak a decade later led scientists to correctly deduce the arrival of yet another coronavirus. Scientists continued the laboratory work in hopes of being ready when the next outbreak occurred.\n",
      "This foresight proved serendipitous. When Chinese scientists published the full genome of the novel coronavirus in January 2020, vaccine researchers from all over the world were ready. What followed was one of the most remarkable feats in the history of science and medicine. With international cooperation, several vaccines progressed from early phase I and II clinical trials to phase III clinical trials in just a few months. Vaccine after vaccine seemed promising as they hurdled the early phases, and doctors and scientists held their collective breaths as the progress seemed too good to be true. The US FDA set its target for approving a vaccine at 50 percent efficacy, which is a very low target. Setting the bar this low was a nod to the uncertainty surrounding this endeavor. When the data from the first phase 3 trial was reported by Pfizer, the results were stunning.\n",
      "The Pfizer/BioNTechtwo-dose vaccine showed a 95 percent efficacy for prevention of Covid-19 infection among patients who had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Efficacy after only one dose was more than 52 percent. Just as encouraging, it showed an 89 percent efficacy for prevention of severe infection. Overall, the results from this first-ever Covid-19 vaccine exceeded the most optimistic expectations. This vaccine and the others that follow is the beginning of the end for the pandemic.Shortly after the Pfizer announcement, other pharmaceutical companies announced their interim phase 3 trial results. Moderna, Astra/Zeneca, and Sinopharm released vaccine efficacy figures ranging from 70 percent to 95 percent.\n",
      "These phase 3 trials need to be completed with at least two months of safety data, but there is every reason to be optimistic that the data will be similar to the Pfizer/BioNTechexperience. The Moderna vaccine, which is also an RNA vaccine like that of Pfizer/BioNTech, has so far shown a 95 percent efficacy for preventing symptomatic Covid-19, and 100 percent efficacy for prevention of severe Covid-19. More interim results from other vaccine studies will soon be released, and there is good reason to hope that many more effective vaccines will be available by the first quarter of 2021.\n",
      "The Pfizer FDA application states that there are adverse events from the vaccine, but most of these are mild and tolerable. Some clinical trial participants reported injection-site discomfort and flu-like symptoms, but the overall safety data between the vaccine recipients and the placebo control were similar. Recent reports of severe allergic reactions in two healthcare workers who had a history of severe allergies prompted the UK health authorities to caution people with a history of severe allergies against receiving the vaccine.Since people who had a history of severe allergies were excluded from the clinical trials, this precaution is prudent while the manufacturer and health authorities investigate the circumstances surrounding the events. They did not suspend administration of the vaccine in otherwise healthy people.\n",
      "As more vaccines are released for use, more of these reactions or adverse events are expected, as is usual with new drugs. Safety data are continuously collected among those who were enrolled in the original clinical trials. The large number of subjects enrolled in these clinical trials means that any severe reaction that was missed would be very rare, with a less than one in 10,000 probability of occurrence. These rarer adverse events, if any, can be captured with good phase 4 post-marketing surveillance by manufacturers and health authorities.\n",
      "I get repeatedly asked whether I would take the vaccine if it were offered to me today. As long as it is a properly approved vaccine proven to be safe and efficacious, I would not hesitate to take it. As a healthcare worker and frontliner, I am much more concerned about contracting Covid-19 that can kill me or my loved ones than the possibility of rare side effects. Covid-19 is a clear and present danger to us all, and vaccines are a way out of the constant fear of infection. I would recommend it to my parents and my in-laws who are in their 70s and their 80s respectively. I would give it to my kids once clinical data for children are available. I can’t wait for my kids to go back to physical school again. I want to be free of the constant fear that I may bring home something deadly from work. Vaccination will allow us to be with friends and family again. Vaccination will restore that most important of human experiences, the ability to touch each other and hold those closest to us.

Hindi ito dapat madaliin,” Hontiveros said. (Before injecting {the vaccine} to millions of Filipinos, the vaccine must be safe and there are no serious side effects. Health standards and safety step should be followed. There is no need to rush things.)\n",
      "“There are multiple and undeniable issues surrounding the vaccine offered by China, including transparency of data and results, emerging side effects as seen in Peru and even a company history of bribery. This is enough reason to worry. If we want people to trust the government’s decisions and to trust vaccination, we need to earn it. There should be no compromises. Follow the protocol,” she said.\n",
      "Hontiveros pointed out that the Sinovac vaccine is one of the most expensive available in the market at P3,629.50 in the Department of Health’s (DOH) projection of prices.\n",
      "“So if it hasn’t been proven to be safe, and it isn’t even cheap, what is the basis for our preference for this vaccine?” she asked.\n",
      "The lady senator also warned against China’s ‘vaccine diplomacy,’ citing leading research center Yusof Ishak Institute findings that the vaccine supply is “not unconditional” and that it could be used as a tool to advance the country’s interest in the West Philippine Sea.\n",
      "“Hindi tayo dapat basta-basta bibili ng bakuna. Do not sacrifice Filipinos’ health on the altar of the President’s bias towards China, which has continuously denied the Hague ruling and abused our waters,” she said. (We should not just buy vaccines.)\n",
      "‘’This is about health, not politics. We shouldn’t entertain political favors when livesare at stake, especially not those that can be harmful to the sovereignty of the country. Hindi dapat maging kapalit ng bakuna ang pananahimik ng bansa sa patuloy na pangangamkam at pagbabastos ng China sa West Philippine Sea (WPS),” Hontiveros added. (This vaccine should not be in exchange for the country’s silence in the face of depredations and shameful acts of China in the WPS). SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The World Health Organization said Tuesday it is in discussions with Pfizer and Moderna about possibly including their high-tech coronavirus vaccines among early jabs for poor countries at affordable prices.\n",
      "The WHO-backed Covax facility, created to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines around the world as they become available, is aiming to provide some two billion doses by the end of next year.It has already secured hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine candidates being developed by AstraZeneca, Novavax and Sanofi-GSK.WHO senior advisor Bruce Aylward said the organisation was looking at a range of other jabs, as well as the current frontrunners.\n",
      "He said WHO was “in conversations” with Pfizer and Moderna about whether their products could be part of “early roll-out of vaccines”.\n",
      "But, he stressed, “we also need to make sure that they are at prices that are appropriate for the populations we are trying to serve and the countries we are trying to help.”US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has, along with German BioNTech, created the first coronavirus jab to receive regulatory approval in a number of Western countries. Vaccination campaigns have already begun in Britain and the United States.The Moderna vaccine is expected to quickly receive approvals as well.\n",
      "– Light, but a long tunnel –\n",
      "Both vaccines use cutting-edge technology and have been shown in Phase III trials to be highly effective — and they are expected to be expensive.\n",
      "But Aylward hailed public comments from Pfizer chief Albert Bourla in which he talked about cutting prices for low-income countries.“He has said we are committed to making sure that our products see global use and we recognise that requires pricing it at the right level to be able to make that work,” Aylward said.\n",
      "“So there is a strong commitment from Pfizer out there to be able to do that.”Covax wanted to have a diverse portfolio of vaccines to offer and would evaluate “any product out there with demonstrated efficacy, safety, quality”, he added.\n",
      "The vaccines developed by China and Russia could also be evaluated for inclusion “if they meet the standards for efficacy and safety”, he said.\n",
      "A year into the pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.6 million lives worldwide, Aylward hailed the positive vaccine news over the past month.“There is light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.

      "WASHINGTON — The US regulator on Tuesday released new data confirming Moderna’s COVID19 vaccine was safe and effective, a strong sign that it could receive emergency approval in days and be ready to roll out by next week.\n",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said there were “no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA (emergency use authorization)” and confirmed an overall efficacy of 94.1 percent.\n",
      "This file photo taken on November 18, 2020 shows a syringe and a bottle reading “Vaccine Covid-19” next to the Moderna biotech company logo.\n",
      "(Photo by JOEL SAGET / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine began on Monday and if the FDA green lights Moderna’s, rollout of some six million doses could start next Monday.That would represent a powerful second weapon in the country with the world’s biggest outbreak of the virus, where more than 300,000 people have died and a winter surge is raging.\n",
      "Also Tuesday, the FDA announced it had approved the first at-home rapid COVID-19 test, which will be available without prescription and return results in about 20 minutes.\n",
      "But supply of the test, made by California-based Ellume, will initially be limited, with just three million units expected in January.\n",
      "Stops severe cases\n",
      "The FDA document on the Moderna vaccine offered the clearest look yet into the two-dose regimen, co-developed with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Moderna began working on the vaccine in January and has received $2.5 billion in federal funds.\n",
      "On Thursday, an independent group of scientists will convene to debate everything known so far about the product.\n",
      "The panel is expected to vote in favor of an EUA, and the FDA normally heeds its recommendations. According to the new data, the shots protected younger people slightly better than older people.In a clinical trial of 30,400 people, 196 fell ill with COVID-19 by November 21 – 11 in the vaccine group and 185 in the placebo group.\n",
      "Efficacy was 95.6 percent for people aged 18-65; 86.4 percent among those aged 65 and older; and 94.1 percent overall. Importantly, of 30 cases of severe COVID-19, all occurred in the placebo group.\n",
      "The FDA also looked at detailed safety data at a median of nine weeks after participants received the second shot, 28 days after the first.\n",
      "Cutting-edge technology\n",
      "The most common side effects associated with the drug, called mRNA-1273, were injection site pain in roughly 90 percent of cases; fatigue in 70 percent, headache in 60 percent, muscle pain in 60 percent, joint pain in 45 percent and chills in 45 percent.\n",
      "Few of these effects were classed as “severe” and, when they were, that tended to occur more in the young than in the old.Lymphadenopathy, or swollen lymph nodes, occurred in 1.1 percent of the vaccine group against 0.6 percent of the placebo group.\n",
      "There was an imbalance in allergic reactions, which occurred in 1.5 percent of the vaccinated population compared to 1.1 percent of the non-vaccinated.\n",
      "But none were classed as severe or anaphylactic.\n",
      "The frequency of life-threatening events was low, around one percent in each group, with no suggestion the vaccine was the cause.\n",
      "To date, there have been three reports of Bell’s palsy – a facial paralysis condition, most often temporary – in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group.\n",
      "The Pfizer trial saw four people get Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group, and none in the placebo group.\n",
      "The FDA said there was insufficient information to determine that either vaccine was the cause.\n",
      "Andrew Morris, a University of Toronto professor of medicine who has studied the condition, said “it is becoming increasingly likely that there is an important relationship with Bell’s (facial) palsy.”\n",
      "However, “the absolute risk – in light of the risks associated with COVID19 – is small,” he stressed.\n",
      "Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) molecules to cause human cells to express a surface molecule of the new coronavirus.\n",
      "This simulates an infection and trains the immune system to be ready in case it encounters the real virus.\n",
      "The mRNA is encased inside fatty particles. Both companies used a slightly different formulation resulting in different cold-storage requirements: -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) for Pfizer; -20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) for Moderna. Moderna has applied for approval in over-18s, while Pfizer’s approval is for over-16s. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Senator Christopher “Bong” Go today urged the national government to conduct a massive information campaign to educate the public on the ongoing process that government is taking to secure safe and effective coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines for Filipinos.Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go\n",
      "(OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Go, chairman of the Senate health and demography committee, emphasized the need to inform the public on the various modes of procurement — as well as plans on the eventual distribution and use — until expected full recovery through ‘herd immunity’ is achieved when the COVID-19 vaccine roadmap is properly implemented.“Huwag nating pabayaan ang mga ordinaryong Pilipino. Bigyan dapat ng tamang impormasyon ang publiko para hindi matakot at magkaroon ng confidence ukol sa mga vaccines na ito ,’’ he said. (Do not ignore the ordinary Filipinos. Provide the public with accurate information to allay fears and boost their confidence on these vaccines.)Earlier, President Duterte and Go have expressed their willingness to be one of the first to get a dose of the vaccine to encourage the public and allay fears on its safety and efficacy.\n",
      "“Ako, I’m very much willing na mauna kami ni Pangulong Duterte just to prove to the people na safe na po ito (I’m very much willing that I and President Duterte would be the first to be inoculated just to prove to the people that this is safe),” he said during an ambush interview right after he led the distribution of assistance to typhoon victims in Arayat, Pampanga.\n",
      "He later proceeded to Candaba to aid more typhoon victims there after the interview.\n",
      "Go has also challenged Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. to be injected first to further build public confidence.\n",
      "“Kunin natin ang kumpiyansa [ng mga tao]… Maraming gustong magpaturok pero takot ang attitude ng Pilipino ngayon. Kayo [government officials] muna ang mauna para mawala ang takot ng tao. Totoo naman, dapat safe, unahin natin ang safety. Mahirap naman magsisihan sa huli,’’ he stressed. (Let’s get the confidence of the people…there are many people who want to be inoculated but they are afraid. The government officials should be the first to be injected to allay the fears of the public. It is true that we should prioritize the safety of the vaccine. It is hard to regret later.\n",
      "A phone survey conducted by the Social Weather Station (SWS) from September 17 to 20 revealed that 31 percent of Filipinos are unwilling to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Thirty two percent said they would “definitely” get the vaccine while 34 percent responded that they would “probably” get vaccinated.\n",
      "Go also emphasized the commitment of the government to prioritize the poor and vulnerable sectors, as well as frontliners, including medical workers, teachers and uniformed personnel once a safe and effective vaccine is determined.\n",
      "As Senate health committee chairman, Go has always reminded authorities to urgently act on the matter while following the necessary processes to ensure that public resources are properly utilized in pursuit of the availability of sufficient COVID-19 vaccines.He also assured that the government is exploring several ways to secure enough vaccines for the Filipinos.Go earlier said that the proposed 2021 budget includes an appropriated amount for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccine, and an unprogrammed appropriation which could also be used for this purpose.\n",
      "He further explained that on top of the 2021 budget and the amount allocated through the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act intended for direct procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, there are other various modes of procurement for the vaccines that the Duterte Administration is exploring.\n",
      "“Other equally important modes include multilateral loans with the ADB and World Bank, bilateral loans with select countries, and private sector financing through tripartite agreement among the national government, pharmaceutical company and a private company, with no cost to the government,” he explained.\n",
      "He emphasized the need for everyone’s commitment to act responsibly by following the health and safety protocols issued by government.“Ngayong Pasko, ingat muna tayo habang nandyan ang COVID-19. ‘Wag muna kayong magparty. Kasama ang pamilya n’yo, dasal kayo, kumain kayo ng Noche Buena, kayo-kayo lang, ‘wag muna kayo mag-imbita ng kapitbahay, ‘wag muna kayong lumabas habang wala pang vaccine,’’ he said.

This was the assurance given by the country’s vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, said City Mayor Edgar Labella. “I just talked to Secretary Galvez and he informed me that Cebu City will be prioritized once the vaccine is available,” Labella said in a press conference on Tuesday.\n",
      " Labella said the city will be purchasing the vaccines to augment the doses that the national government will be providing to the city. Labella said P500 million will be included in the 2021 annual budget for the purchase of the vaccines. “We have to wait for the guidelines. I was told there has to be a tripartite agreement between the supplier and the city and national governments,” said Labella. If possible, 100 percent of the city population will be vaccinated, said Labella. “It was said that only 70 percent of the community will be vaccinated just to have herd immunity.

      "“I’m not surprised that this has been the reaction. My only surprise is they did not answer the question on efficacy and safety data and then resorted to those kinds of assaults which I think will be unfair to my personality,” Leachon told ANC in an interview on Tuesday.\n",
      "“I was just asking a fair scientific question in order to gain the confidence of the people in terms of their acceptance of vaccination,” he added.Roque and Galvez both slammed Leachon after the latter tweeted that the government’s prioritization of vaccines which does not have “enough safety and efficacy data” is “disturbing.”\n",
      "The former NTF adviser pointed out that the vaccine by Chinese manufacturer Sinovac Biotech which the government is inclined to purchase have not received any Emegrycn Use Aithtozition (EUA) nor any Food and Drugs Admiandatrio (FDA) approval “to warrant an ordering of a particular volume of stock that will start in March.”\n",
      "“Basically that is the premise of the situation why I was questioning the efficacy rate and the safety considering that particular drug was started in mass vaccination in China when the vaccine has not finished Phase 3 trials so this is the questions that we need to understand,” Leachon said.\n",
      "The health expert also denied that he is “anti-China,” saying it was not the reason why he is questioning the possible procurement of the Sinovac-made vaccine.“As a clinician, as well as a former executive of a pharmaceutical industry, you always base the procurement of a certain product based on efficacy and safety and of course the evaluation because this is the main thing that would actually allow you for market authorization,” he said.\n",
      "The health expert said that Sinovac has yet to have “regulatory documents.”\n",
      "“We don’t have the regulatory documents for efficacy and safety which should be transparent and should be reviewed by our public health experts as well as other epidemiologists,” he said.Leachon reiterated that his questions for “scientific” and “collegial.”\n",
      "“It is my role as a health advocate to really tell the truth regarding certain medical aspects of the COVID pandemic response,” he said.\n",

      "Opposition Senator Risa Hontiveros today questioned the capacity of the National Taskforce on COVID-19 (NTF) and the Department of Health (DOH) to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine to geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA) given the unsolved difficulties in existing immunization programs.\n",
      "Sen. Risa Hontiveros (Albert Calvelo/Senate PRIB)\n",
      "“A documented difficulty by the DOH in the Sabayang Patak Laban sa Polio is the low immunization coverage in some areas, owing to the difficulties in terrain. Magkakalayo ang mga bahay at mahirap ang mga dadaanan. Hindi pa ito matugunan ng DOH ngayon, so paano natin masisiguro na itong COVID-19 vaccine ay makakarating sa mga nangangailangan, given na napaka-sensitibo ng bakuna sa temperature changes?” she asked. (…Houses are located in far places. The DOH has not solved this problem. Now, how sure are we that the COVID-19 vaccines could reach target areas, given the fact that these vaccines are sensitive to temperature changes?)\n",
      "“I support Senator (Francis) Pangilinan’s call for a hearing by a Senate Committee of the Whole to iron out all the details from preparations, to roll-out, to finish. As I said before, public trust is crucial in a public health crisis. This is a massive project that should be made clear to the whole of government, whole of society. Everyone has to be confident in the game plan,’’ Hontiveros said.Hontiveros also called for government to begin creating a post-vaccination COVID-19 response plan after an editorial published in November in the Nature Journal showed that vaccinated individuals can still spread the coronavirus to others.\n",
      "“To my layperson’s ears, it means you can be protected from COVID-19 but you can pass it on to others. I imagine that there are specific populations that cannot be vaccinated, like the very young. They will continue to be vulnerable to COVID. We cannot let our guard down and the protocols should be maintained,” she said.\n",
      "Hontiveros warned that vaccination is not the ‘’magic bullet’’ to putting an end to the pandemic.\n",
      "‘’We must create sustainable strategies for safely co-existing with COVID-19 while we roll-out vaccination,” she added. “It is of the utmost importance that we think of the end in mind, if not we might see a whole new wave of infections.”Hontiveros added that after the vaccination of the indigent groups, it is important to begin securing and allocating funds for mass vaccination. “We can only achieve herd immunity if 60-70 percent of the population gets vaccinated. If the DOH and NTF foresee the process to take the next four to five years, are we financially prepared to make it happen? The threat of a hiccup in our plans might cost lives,” she said.\n",
      "“Ito ang pinakamalaking vaccination program in the history of our country. If we don’t do it right, we’ll waste billions of pesos and risk millions of lives,” she added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "He handles COVID patients’ ventilators, one of the riskiest jobs in the pandemic.A single word captured what it meant to him: “Hope.”The doctor might have felt excited to be among the first in the world to get injected with molecules of synthetic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), the cutting-edge technology proven to be 95 percent effective in preventing COVID-19.But given the coronavirus’ stark toll – 300,000 fatalities in the US alone – that just didn’t feel right.“Excitement, in my personal view, doesn’t give the appropriate amount of deference and respect and honor to the sacrifice of my colleagues in health care, some of whom have gotten sick, some of whom have died,” said the visibly emotional 52- year-old.\n",
      "A distant light is glimmering at the end of the tunnel, but in the spring the situation appeared bleak to inundated health care workers like Pla: “I didn’t have a lot of hope back then there would be a vaccine by the end of the year.”Leading the way Pla and his colleagues said they felt honored as the first recipients, a group chosen through an algorithm that assessed risk levels.They also want to use their platforms to encourage others to follow their lead.Shylee Stewart, a 26-year-old registered nurse in the labor and delivery department, said the vaccine was “beneficial” given how many COVID-positive patients with unknown status come through, adding that most of the nurses in her department planned to get shots.She encouraged ordinary people to “do your research; make sure you make the right decision for yourself.”“Nine times out of 10, that decision is to get vaccinated,” she said.Her message comes at a time of growing vaccine skepticism, not only in the United States but across much of the developed world.A new poll by NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist College found that 61 percent of Americans say they’ll choose to get the coronavirus vaccine if it is made available, against 32 percent who said they wouldn’t.An unmasked anti-vaxxer heckler interrupted Monday’s press interviews with those being vaccinated, but the surveys show that overall national confidence is increasing, highlighting the importance of such events.Pla, a Black physician, said he felt an added level of responsibility toward his community and other racial minorities, who have been let down by a history of unethical medical research, along with medicine’s institutional racism that persists today.He said it would be vital to be “going out into the community and spreading the word” in the weeks and months ahead.Meanwhile, an Ontario caregiver and an octogenarian in Quebec on Monday became the first people vaccinated against COVID-19 in Canada.Anita Quidangen was televised receiving the injection at a hospital in Toronto as part of a major vaccination campaign in Canada, less than a week after the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was granted approval in the country.Another woman, 89-year-old Gisele Levesque, was vaccinated minutes earlier at a retirement home in Quebec City, but her procedure was not shown on TV, Quebec Health Minister Christian Dube revealed shortly afterwards.“I’m okay,” Quidangen told the press. The employee of a long-term care center for seniors in Toronto said she was “excited” about receiving the vaccine so quickly. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "A former adviser of the national task force on the coronavirus response has drawn profanity-laced tirade from President Duterte although such remarks were not carried live in his public address, Malacañang said Monday.\n",
      "Presidential spokesman Harry Roque disclosed that the President has shown his dismay with Dr. Anthony Leachon after suspecting the medical professional was aspiring for a government post.\n",
      "Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque\n",
      "(OPS / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Roque issued the statement after Leachon expressed concern with the government’s effort to prioritize certain vaccines despite lack of safety and efficacy data.“Tatapatin ko na si Dr. Leachon. Na-edit lang sa mga ‘Talk to the people’ pero ang daming beses na namura kayo ng Presidente kasi ang sabi niya kung anu-ano ang sinasabi mo yunpala nagnanais ka lang ng posisyon sa gobyeryno (I will be frank with Dr. Leachon. The President’s ‘Talk to the people’ have been edited but there were many times you were cursed by the President because he said you’re saying so many things and yet it appears you’re just aspiring for a government post),” Roque said during a televised press briefing.\n",
      "“Next time murahin kayo ng Presidente (When the President curses you next time), I will insist it will be shown to the people. Baka akalain niyo natutuwa ang Presidente sa inyo, hindi po (You might think the President is pleased with you but he is not),” he added.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also slammed Leachon during the same virtual press conference, citing his difficulty in working with him when he was part of the task force. He said Leachon, who had a brief stint as special adviser to the NTF last June, made some “very questionable” pronouncements.\n",
      "“Sa NTF, nagsama kami. Mahirap po siyang kasama. May sariling mundo (We were together at the NTF. He’s difficult to deal with. He has his own world),” Galvez said.The former military official’s comment triggered laughter from Roque during the virtual press conference. “Mas maganda ang linya mo (You have a better line) Secretary Galvez. Thank you,” he said.\n",
      "Leachon earlier tweeted his concern about the government’s vaccine acquisition plans and called for transparency. “Isn’t it disturbing that the government is still prioritizing the vaccines for which they’re are not enough safety and efficacy data? Perhaps we need to know the matrix or guidelines on their priority list. Transparency is key.Safety is paramount,” he said.\n",
      "Reacting to the latest statement from the Palace, Leachon dispelled talk that he was eyeing a government post. He explained that he merely raised concern about the need to have safe and effective vaccines in the country.“It’s painful to be accused of something which is baseless and untrue. I have been an independent health reform advocate for many years. I have the highest respect for our President and the government,” he said.“I’m raising a red flag on efficacy and safety data on the vaccines so we can procure the right vaccine for our country. I dreamt of serving the government before but I have no future ambitions to be a public official.I’d like to spend my sunset years with the family, closest friends , and doing advocacy work,” he added.\n",
      "Back in June, Leachon announced on Twitter that he was no longer an adviser of the NTF a day after expressing disappointment with the Department of Health in leading the efforts against the coronavirus outbreak.Galvez later confirmed that Leachon was let go due to the need for concerned officials to work together in battling the pandemic.He claimed that Leachon’s preemptive release of information “jeopardized” the government’s messaging in addressing the pandemic as well as caused “unwarranted misunderstanding” between the NTF and the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).

      "Opposition Sen. Leila de Lima has filed a bill seeking to provide free COVID-19 vaccines to all Filipinos.\n",
      "De Lima, in filing Senate Bill No. 1942 or the Libreng Bakuna Kontra COVID-19 Para sa Lahat ng Pilipino Act, reiterated the need to safeguard the health of Filipinos by allocating funds and mandating the country’s health system to offer the vaccines free of charge.\n",
      "Senator Leila de Lima\n",
      "(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "“Anticipating the arrival of these vaccines subject to trials and local evaluation soonest, this representation believes the need to guarantee free vaccination for all Filipinos whose right to health should not be diminished by belatedly acting on the health crisis,” De Lima said.\n",
      "As hopes grow for the early arrival of the vaccines in the country, she said the government must be prepared and guarantee people safe and efficient distribution of the vaccine especially the priority and vulnerable sectors of society.\n",
      "“It cannot be overemphasized: Vaccine coverage is as important as vaccine efficacy,” she stressed.\n",
      "De Lima noted the government’s vaccination plan “leaves much to be desired” despite the Executive branch’s report about its continued negotiations with pharmaceutical companies for at least 14 specific COVID-19 vaccines for local use.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez had earlier said the government is targeting to vaccinate 60 to 70 percent of the country’s population, with elderly citizens, frontliners, and those included in the vulnerable sectors to be prioritized in the immunization program.\n",
      "But Galvez also claimed that the country would now have to fight for the remaining percentage of future COVID-19 vaccine supplies as rich countries had already procured 80 percent of the global market.\n",
      "De Lima, however, said this should not be an excuse for a delayed response in securing vaccine supplies since there are new suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines with equally good efficacy rates that have already emerged.\n",
      "“A concrete plan of action that will universally promote the right of all Filipinos to health is vital in winning this battle against COVID-19,” she said.\n",
      "“A vaccination plan that is inclusive will be an instrument to create herd immunity in a country of more than 100 million.”De Lima said the bill also provides informed consent to allow persons to choose which accredited COVID-19 vaccine to receive and the institutions from which to receive them.\n",
      "The measure likewise mandates the creation of a database to ensure the tracking of vaccination recipients in case of problems that may arise after the administration of the vaccines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "All signs point to pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and minors under 16-years-old not getting any COVID-19 vaccine shots in the foreseeable future due to safety concerns, said Anakalusugan party-list Rep. Mike Defensor Sunday, as the very promising Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is beginning to make waves abroad, particularly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada where it has been approved for use.\n",
      "(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "“For now, the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE cannot be used in individuals younger than 16-years-old, based on our comprehensive review of the EUAs (emergency use authorizations) issued by pharmaceutical regulators in the three countries,” Defensor said.\n",
      "“The use of the vaccine in pregnant women and mothers who are breastfeeding is also either totally not recommended, or being discouraged with stern warnings,” Defensor, a Health committee vice chairman, also said.“We expect our own Food and Drug Administration here to affirm the same recommendations – once the vaccine gets an EUA here – simply because the safety and efficacy of the shots in children under 16, pregnant women, and mothers who are breastfeeding has yet to established by further clinical trials,” he said.\n",
      "The House leadership said it’s plausible that the same recommendations would apply to all newly developed COVID-19 vaccines that would eventually obtain EUAs in the Philippines.\n",
      "Defensor’s assessment came just as the Philippines is expected to undergo a “baby boom” owing to lockdowns and strict stay-at-home orders as a result of the pandemic.The Commission on Population and Development said the country will record two million pregnancies this year, some 214,000 of which are unplanned.\n",
      "Defensor said that in Britain, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is “absolutely not recommended for use in pregnant women and mothers who are breastfeeding.”“In fact, under their immunization guidelines, in all women of child-bearing age, pregnancy has to be ruled out first prior to vaccination. Women of child-bearing age are also being told to avoid pregnancy for at least two months after their second dose of the vaccine,” he said.The vaccine is meant to be administered intramuscularly in the arm in a series of two doses 21 days apart.“It is unknown whether the vaccine is excreted in human milk, and risks to newborns and infants cannot be excluded. Thus, in Britain, they are not recommending the shots during breastfeeding,” Defensor said.Meanwhile, having a clear budget for the purchase of the coronavirus vaccines should be the government’s top priority to address the public health crisis, Vice President Leni Robredo’s spokesperson said Sunday.Speaking on Robredo’s weekly radio show, Barry Gutierrez said he was surprised over the lack of a definite source of funds to immunize millions of Filipinos next year.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon hadclaimed the P72.5 billion earmarked for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget is like an “unfunded check.”Under the P4.5-trillion national budget for next year, only P2.5 billion out of the P72.5 billion vaccine allocation is funded.\n",
      "The remaining P70 billion, according to Drilon, is allocated under the “unprogrammed funds” provision of the 2021 General Appropriations Bill (GAB) which the Senate and the House ratified last week.“‘Di ba dapat iyan ang una nating tinitiyak na mayroon tayong pondo lalo na itong bakuna. Narinig ko na sinabi ng Pangulo ito ilang beses na sa dulo ang pinakasolusyon lang sa COVID – bakuna,” he said.(Shouldn’t the first thing we make sure is we have funds especially for the vaccines. I heard the President said this a few times the best solution to COVID at the end is vaccine)“Kung anong pera mayroon tayo dapat diyan agad ilagay ‘yan. Bakit mo ilalagay sa ibang ahensya? Ito ‘yung pinakaimportante,” Gutierrez added.(We should put whatever funds we have for that. Why would you allocate it to other agencies? This is the most important)Robredo’s spokesman lamented the administration’s “lack of sense of urgency” in securing COVID-19 vaccines supply when there is a global race to buy the vaccines.\n",
      "“Nagtataka ako bakit parang hindi pa tayo masyadong kumikilos (I’m wondering why we haven’t taken much action),” he said. “Hindi nga tayo nagbayad ng reservation fee (We haven’t paid yet the reservation fee).” (With a report from Raymund F. Antonio) SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The National Institute of Health said Friday that it had decided to interrupt the trial after a volunteer had difficulty moving their arms, according to local media.\n",
      "“Several days ago we signaled, as we are required, to the regulatory authorities that one of our participants (in trials) presented neurological symptoms which could correspond to a condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome,” said chief researcher German Malaga in comments to the press. \n",
      "Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare and non-contagious disorder which affects the movement of the arms and legs. Peru declared a temporary health emergency in five regions in June last year following multiple cases.In the 1970s a campaign to innoculate Americans against a supposedly devastating strain of swine flu ground to a halt after some 450 of those vaccinated developed the syndrome, which can also cause paralysis.\n",
      "Peru’s clinical trials for the Sinopharm vaccine were due to conclude this week, after testing around 12,000 people.If they are successful — which won’t be known until mid-2021 — the Peruvian government was expected to buy up to 20 million doses to inoculate two-thirds of its population.60,000 across the globe have already taken the Sinopharm vaccine, including volunteers in Argentina, Russia and Saudi Arabia.Peru has one of the world’s highest per capita death rate from the virus, which as of Friday had caused 36,499 deaths and 979,111 infections.The pandemic has hit the South American country’s economy hard, with GDP plunging more than 30 percent in the second quarter.

      "Government purchase of COVID-19 vaccines has been spared from the participation of the Philippine International Trade Corp., a State-run government firm that has been smarting from criticisms from senators and State auditors for its alleged snail-paced procurement of equipment and supplies by a number of agencies.\n",
      "In a virtual briefing conducted by PITC for members of the House Committee on Trade and Industry, Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon Lopez disclosed that so far, PITC has not been asked to take a role in the purchase of much-needed vaccines from international drug laboratories and suppliers.\n",
      "“Sa ngayon wala pang role ang PITC, ang immediate procurement agency is PS-DBM (Right now PITC has not been given a role),” Lopez told lawmakers during the meeting with lawmakers.Lopez and PITC President Dave Alimurung briefed solons on PITC tasks in the procurement by various government agencies of supplies and materials that can be sourced from international suppliers.\n",
      "The two defended PITC from accusations that it had “parked” over P33 billion entrusted by agencies that relied on the State-owned importer to help purchase equipment and supplies.\n",
      "Asked by Marikina City Rep. Stella Luz Quimbo if PITC will be involved in COVID-19 vaccine procurement, Lopez said a special vaccine committee, not the PITC, will do it.\n",
      "“PITC has not been asked to joint certain meetings pagdating sa vaccine purchase,” said Lopez.\n",
      "Solons present during the meeting no longer commented on Lopez’s statement.\n",
      "In the recently-released 2019 annual audit report for PITC, CoA disclosed that as of end of the year, over P9.17 billion from various agencies remained unutilized for a period of ten years starting 2009.\n",
      "“These unutilized fund transfers were not yet returned to the concerned client-government agencies and or national government contrary to the provisions under Section 10 of the General Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019 on the Reversion, Closure, and Transfer of Special Accounts,” said CoA.\n",
      "Auditors also noted that interest earnings amounting to P581.135 million from money market placements of parked funds have not been recorded as PITC income, instead of remitting the money to the National Treasury.\n",
      "Reacting to the CoA findings, Alimurung said a total of P324 million has already been remitted to the national coffers.\n",
      "A check on 2019 annual audit reports of other agencies that were released this year indicated that PITC has delayed or has failed to deliver various procurement items from these agencies.\n",

      "DAVAO CITY – An official from a foreign government has reportedly reached out to the Davao City government, offering to provide much-needed vaccines against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) once the Philippine government issues an emergency use authorization (EUA).\n",
      "Mayor Sara Duterte (Facebook / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "This was disclosed by Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, who added that, based on\n",
      "the initial exchange of emails, the envoy told the city that their government has allowed its vaccine-maker to strike deals with any offshore buyers, aside from national governments.The local chief executive did not disclose the foreign government.\n",
      "Last Thursday, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said the Philippines plans to procure vaccines from Sinovac Biotech of China, Oxford-AstraZeneca of United Kingdom, and Pfizer-BioNTech of the United States next year.\n",
      "Duterte said the offer of vaccines directly to Davao City was a “positive” development because the previous communications the city had with another pharmaceutical company, which said that it will only sell its COVID-19 vaccines to the Department of Health (DOH).“An official from another country listened to our radio broadcast and then they already reached out to us and there were initial exchanges of emails already. This is very positive because according to them they are allowed by their country to sell to whoever is the buyer,” she said.However, Duterte added that they have yet to ascertain if the national government would allow a local government unit to buy directly from vaccine-makers.\n",
      "Citing the envoy, Duterte said: “We do not know if you need the permission of the DOH to buy from us.”\n",
      "Duterte said that the government has yet to give the EUA to any vaccine.\n",
      "“We are waiting for that document also so that we will know what brand of vaccines will be given with the EUA by our national government so we can pursue them. But, as of now, we are not waiting for that because we are already seeking out company… if they will say ‘no,’ we will lose nothing because we are already in the middle of this pandemic. That is why, we are trying to reach out and talk and ask what are the possibilities available for LGU,” she said.\n",
      "Duterte added that another vaccine-maker could provide vaccines to the city if it could participate in the phase 3 of the clinical trials.\n",
      "“The only way to access, as of now, if we participate in clinical trials. Their advice to us was to write a letter and request that Davao City will be included in a clinical trial so that we can access the vaccines for our plans of voluntary vaccination for health and non-health frontliners,” she added.Davao City reverted to general community quarantine (GCQ) from modified GCQ last November 20, which was expected to last until 30, but has since been extended until the end of this year.\n",
      "As of December 10, Department of Health-Davao reported a total of 10,520 cases in the region, with 2,459 active, 7,651 recoveries, and 410 deaths.Of the total cases, Davao City reported 7,369, Davao de Oro with 483, Davao del Norte with 1,284, Davao del Sur with 784, Davao Occidental with 122, and Davao Oriental with 478.

      "Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca’s Russian branch said Friday it would use part of Russia’s homemade Sputnik V vaccine in further clinical trials, a major sign of recognition for a jab that has been viewed with scepticism by the West.(Photo by NELSON ALMEIDA / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Russia was one of the first countries to announce the development of a coronavirus vaccine, which it named Sputnik V after the Soviet era satellite.\n",
      "While the jab is yet to complete its third and final phase of testing involving some 40,000 volunteers, its developers have said that interim trial results showed 95 percent efficacy.\n",
      "“Today we announce a clinical trial programme to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a combination of AZD1222, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and Sputnik V, developed by Russian Gamaleya Research institute,” AstraZeneca said in a statement published on its website in English and Russian on Friday.\n",
      "The pharmaceutical company said that adults aged 18 and over will be enrolled in the trials, expected to start before the end of the year.\n",
      "While the Sputnik V jab uses human adenovirus vectors, AZD1222 relies on adenovirus from chimpanzees. Both are administered in two doses.\n",
      "Russia’s Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which was involved in the development of Sputnik V, said in its own statement on Friday that on November 23 it offered AstraZeneca “to use one of the two vectors of the Sputnik V vaccine in additional clinical trials of its own vaccine”.Moscow announced the registration of Sputnik V back in August, after it had completed the second phase of trials on under 100 volunteers, raising concerns from scientists at home and abroad.Analysts viewed the fast-track registration and the early launch of mass vaccination as an effort for Russia to bolster its geopolitical influence.Several Russian allies — including India, Venezuela and Belarus — have said they would take part in clinical trials for the jab, while Kremlin-friendly governments have pre-ordered more than a billion doses of Sputnik V.Ignoring accusations by Britain of Russian-linked hackers targeting vaccine research, Moscow has said it is open to cooperation with Western countries.\n",
      "The vaccine’s developers said it will be available on international markets for less than $10 (8.40 euros) per dose — and that it can be stored at between two and eight degrees Celsius (between 35.6 and 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit) instead of the temperatures far below freezing required for some other vaccines.\n",
      "‘Unique example of cooperation’\n",
      "In its statement on Friday, AstraZeneca said that “combinations of different COVID-19 vaccines may be an important step in generating wider protection through a stronger immune response and better accessibility.”\n",
      "The British-Swedish drugmaker added that cooperation with the Gamaleya Research Institute is “important to explore the potential of vaccine combinations unlocking synergies in protection and accessibility through a portfolio approach.”\n",
      "The pharmaceutical giant had earlier said that its vaccine was on average 70 percent effective.Head of RDIF Kirill Dmitriyev said on Friday that the collaboration will be a “unique example of cooperation between scientists from different countries in jointly fighting coronavirus”.While Russia’s second wave has continued to surge in recent weeks, the country has refrained from reimposing a strict nationwide lockdown as it did in the spring and pinned its hopes on mass vaccination.Last week Russia started a large-scale public vaccination drive, offering Sputnik V initially to people in high-risk groups including medical workers and teachers.On Friday it reported 613 virus deaths over the past 24 hours, surpassing the 600 mark for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic.\n",
      "Total fatalities stood at 45,893, while infections jumped to 2,597,711, placing Russia’s caseload fourth-highest in the world.Russia has reported a much lower death rate than other badly hit countries, raising concerns that authorities have downplayed the outbreak.\n",
      "Data published by the country’s federal statistics service on Thursday indicated excess deaths of nearly 165,000 year-on-year between March and October, suggesting virus deaths could be much higher. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

(Photo by JOEL SAGET / AFP)\n",
      "The announcement is a huge setback in efforts to fight the pandemic, which first emerged in China last December and has killed over 1.5 million people worldwide.\n",
      "Sanofi and GSK said the delay in their adjuvanted recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine programme was to “improve immune response in older adults.”\n",
      "The vaccine’s potential availability had been pushed back “from mid-2021 to Q4 2021,” they said in a statement.\n",
      "American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have said their vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.\n",
      "US experts voted Thursday to recommend granting emergency approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, paving the way for America to become the next country to move ahead with mass immunisation after the UK. Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have also approved it.\n",
      "The Sanofi-GSK candidate is based on technology that Sanofi has used to produce seasonal influenza vaccines and on immunological agents developed by GSK.“Phase 1/2 study interim results showed an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a low immune response in older adults likely due to an insufficient concentration of the antigen,” the statement said.\n",
      "It said a recent study in non-human primates using an improved antigen formulation demonstrated that the candidate could “protect against lung pathology and lead to rapid viral clearance from the nasal passages and lungs, within 2 to 4 days.”“These results increase the companies’ confidence in the capacity of the adjuvanted recombinant platform to deliver a highly efficient vaccine for all adults,” it said.The hunt for a vaccine brings up questions like whether unexpected safety issues may arise when the number of people vaccinated grows to millions and possibly billions of people.\n",
      "– ‘More than one vaccine needed’ –\n",
      "Also unknown is whether more side effects will emerge, how long the vaccine remains effective, whether it will limit transmission and how it will work in children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients.\n",
      "“We care greatly about public health which is why we are disappointed by the delay announced today, but all our decisions are and will always be driven by science and data,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Head of Sanofi Pasteur.\n",
      "“We have identified the path forward and remain confident and committed to bringing a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine,” he said.\n",
      "“There is no question of abandoning the vaccine,” he told AFP.Both Russia and China have already begun inoculation campaigns with domestically produced vaccines despite far less vetting, while several other vaccines are being developed in the West.\n",
      "Japan has formalised a deal with UK drugmaker AstraZeneca to receive 120 million doses of its coronavirus vaccines, the health ministry said Friday.Tokyo has also secured Covid-19 vaccines for 60 million people from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and for a further 25 million people from biotech firm Moderna. Vaccination could start as early as March 2021, Kyodo News agency reported this week.\n",
      "“No single pharma company can make it alone; the world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic,” Triomphe said.\n",
      "Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added: “The results of the study are not as we hoped. Based on previous experience and other collaborations, we are confident that GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system, when coupled with a COVID-19 antigen, can elicit a robust immune response.”\n",
      "The companies plan a Phase 2b study expected to start in February. If the data is positive, a global Phase 3 study could start in the second quarter of next year.\n",
      "“Positive results from this study would lead to regulatory submissions in the second half of 2021, hence delaying the vaccine’s potential availability from mid-2021 to Q4 2021,” the statement said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Development of a Covid-19 vaccine in Australia was abandoned Friday after clinical trials produced a false positive HIV result among subjects involved in early-stage testing.\n",
      "The result prompted the government to axe plans to purchase millions of doses of the candidate vaccine and instead increase orders of alternatives from AstraZeneca and Novax, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.\n",
      "“The University of Queensland vaccine will not be able to proceed based on the scientific advice, and that will no longer feature as part of Australia’s vaccine plan,” Morrison said.The candidate vaccine, which was still in phase one trials at the University of Queensland, used a small amount of HIV protein as a “molecular clamp” but triggered an antibody response that could interfere with HIV screening, Health Minister Greg Hunt said.\n",
      "Although the vaccine had proved promising at suppressing Covid-19 and there was no chance of HIV transmission, development was abandoned over fears it could undermine public confidence in vaccinations, Department of Health Secretary Brendan Murphy said.\n",
      "“It probably would have worked very well as a vaccine, but we can’t have any issues with confidence,” Murphy said.\n",
      "Professor Paul Young from the University of Queensland insisted that the HIV protein used in the vaccine was “completely harmless” and posed no health risk to those who took part in trials.\n",
      "The government said the announcement did not change the planned roll-out of other vaccines to begin in March.\n",
      "With Australia recording only a small number of infections daily, the government said it could afford to take a relatively cautious approach to vaccines in comparison to countries with large outbreaks.\n",

      "Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon on Friday likened the P72.5-billion fund earmarked for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines to an unfunded check.\n",
      "Senator Franklin Drilon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Drilon disclosed his assessment as he reiterated his concerns about the lack of a definite source of funds to immunize around 60 million Filipinos next year.\n",
      "Under the proposed P4.5-trillion national budget for 2021, which Congress ratified last Thursday, only P72.5-billion has been allocated by the government for the purchase of the coronavirus vaccines. Of the amount, only P2.5-billion has “solid funding.”The remaining P70-billion is in the unprogrammed fund – the funding for which depends on approved loans or once the government exceeds its non-tax revenues targets.\n",
      "“There is a global race to buy the vaccine,” Drilon said in a statement.\n",
      "“It is unfortunate that in these uncertain times, the budget is creating additional uncertainty. This makes Filipinos wary about the future,” he stressed.\n",
      "“It is like we issue a check without adequate funding. Sana po hindi mag-bounce,” he further quipped.Drilon further pointed out that the Philippines health care system “at this stage is a big question mark to me because of the very fluid plans for the acquisition, funding of the vaccine and the logistical expense that goes with it.\n",
      "“No definite revenue source is identified…The comfort level is not very high that we can achieve a certain degree of confidence insofar as our public health is concerned,” he further said.\n",
      "“I guess we just have to look up at the sky and pray,” he said.Drilon said he is disappointed that the government did not retrieve around P33-billion funds parked and sitting idly in the Philippine International Trading Center (PITC) which could have helped the government vaccinate at least half of the 60 million Filipinos.\n",
      "Then there is also the P16.4-billion fund for anti-insurgency and P9.5-billion for confidential and intelligence funds which, Drilon said, could have augmented the government’s need for additional funding for COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“Talking about misplaced priorities. There is no definite revenue source for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccine but there are P16.4 billion for anti-insurgency and P9.5 billion for confidential and intelligence funds,” Drilon lamented.\n",
      "“There are around 2.7 million Filipino families slipped into poverty due to Covid-19 and, yet, there is no allocation for social amelioration program for next year,” he added.\n",
      "“We do not have a definite source of funds to support the additional P70-billion for the vaccine but we let over P33 billion funds parked and sitting idly in the Philippine International Trading Center (PITC),” said Drilon.Drilon further bewailed how the Filipino people are being kept in the dark about the vaccine rollout.\n",
      "“Where is the vaccine roadmap? Where’s the plan? The lack of a clear roadmap adds to the worries of Filipinos about the future of our country insofar as our ability to fight the pandemic,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Importation of critical medical medicines, including vaccines, are exempted from value added tax under the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act starting January 1, 2021, according to Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon M. Lopez.\n",
      "Lopez said at the Health and the Economic Outlook for 2020 virtual forum the exemption is in view of the ongoing health crisis. “The coverage of VAT-exempt transactions under CREATE has been expanded to cover drugs and medicines for cancer, mental illness, tuberculosis, and kidney diseases beginning January 1, 2021,” said Lopez, who expressed hope that the legislative measure will be signed by President Duterte within this month of December.\n",
      "Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon M. Lopez\n",
      "In addition, under CREATE, export enterprises and domestic enterprises engaged in activities classified as critical industries will enjoy an Income Tax Holiday for 4 to 7 years. There will also be a 5 percent Special Corporate Income Tax Rate (SCIT) based on Gross Income Earned, in lieu of all national and local taxes for 10 years.He said the Board of Investments will formulate the Strategic Investment Priorities Plan (SIPP), which will define the coverage of the sectoral tiers and provide the conditions for qualifying economic activities. This will give premium to projects or activities that have substantial amounts of investments, considerable job generation capacity, and modern technology.\n",
      "It was also his understanding that COVID-19 coming from members of the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) has also zero duty.\n",
      "Aside from CREATE, the signing of RCEP among ASEAN member states, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, and China will offer trade and investment opportunities for the Philippine manufacturing sector.\n",
      "Specifically, he said RCEP will benefit the Philippines in four key areas: cheaper costs, convenience, competitiveness, and complementation.With regard to cheaper cost, it is expected that the RCEP will increase the movement\n",
      "of goods throughout the region. With regard to Convenience, our MSMEs and exporters can engage in seamless transactions through RCEP for all Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners.\n",
      "On competitiveness, Lopez said that RCEP presents a more stable and predictable business environment that is expected to attract more investments in the Philippines.With regard to Complementation, RCEP supports MSME development and participation\n",

      "For instance, in terms of enhanced market access for goods, many of the country’s local products will enjoy significant tariff concessions to enter China, Japan, and Korea. For instance, within the next 10 to 20 years or less, depending on the product, preserved pineapple and car head lights will enter China at 0% tariff; chocolate products and canned fruit juice can be exported to Japan also at 0%; and fresh papaya, beer, and bicycle products can enter Korea at 0%.\n",

      "While the EMA did not give details on the attack, Pfizer and BioNTech said documents relating to their vaccine candidate had been accessed, but that ”no systems have been breached in connection with this incident.”The EMA has promised to reach a decision on conditional approval for Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine by December 29, with a ruling on Moderna’s version to follow by January 12.\n",

      "“As is common with new vaccines, the MHRA have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination,” Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said in a statement.June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said her team looked at two case reports of allergic reactions on Tuesday evening.\n",
      "Both of the people, staff members of the NHS, are recovering well.\n",
      "“We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature, that if we need to strengthen our advice now that we’ve had this experience in the vulnerable populations, we get that advice to the field immediately,” Raine told a panel of lawmakers.Pfizer and BioNTech said they’re supporting the MHRA in its investigation.\n",

      "San Juan City has allocated P50 million for the procurement of vaccines against COVID-19.\n",
      "The City Council recently passed Ordinance No. 75, Series of 2020 appropriating the funds for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines “and other related activities.”\n",
      "“One of the biggest game changers in our fight against COVID-19 is the vaccine. Our City Council has passed an ordinance allocating P50 million for it,” Mayor Francis Zamora said.Ordinance opposed\n",
      "However, the measure was not unanimously approved by the City Council as two councilors, Jannah Ejercito and Franchesco Paul Velasco, opposed the passing of the ordinance.\n",
      "“Hindi sila bumoto pabor dito. Nakalagay sa actual signed ordinance na they voted against it (They did not vote in favor of it. It is stated in the actual signed ordinance that they voted against it),” said the mayor.\n",
      "“That means they voted against allocating P50 million for COVID-19 vaccines for San Juaneños—these vaccines will protect our people from COVID-19 and they voted against the P50 million funding for this.”Councilors explain vote\n",
      "In a phone interview, Ejercito said that she is in favor of purchasing the vaccine. However, she explained that they cannot approve an ordinance allocating funds for procurement of a vaccine that is not yet ready.\n",
      "“As for the vaccine, we are all for it. The problem is, how can you appropriate funds for something that is not yet ready?,” Ejercito told the Manila Bulletin on Thursday.“Pag ready na po ang vaccine kahit 300 million pa yan ay siempre pipirma kami ni Councilor Chesco kasi para sa tao ‘yun (When the vaccine is ready, even if it is worth P300 million, of course Councilor Chesco and I will sign the measure because it is for the people).”\n",
      "‘Unspecified’ COVID-related activities questioned\n",
      "Ejercito also questioned the “other related activities” clause on the measure, noting that such must be specified in order to determine where the allocated funds will go.\n",
      "“All funds must be clearly specified what it is for. Transparency is very important so that everyone would know how the funds were used. We cannot allocate funds for something that what we do not specifically know where the money goes),” she said in a separate Facebook post.\n",
      "“You cannot also procure a vaccine before it is approved. So when the vaccine is approved, and a price is identified, then the City Council will still pass an ordinance realigning a portion of the 2021 budget to fund the procurement. So this ordinance is just ‘pa-pogi,’” she added.For his part, Velasco echoed the concerns raised by Ejercito, saying that they cannot approve funds for a vaccine that is still in the testing process and has yet to be approved.\n",
      "“Lilinawin ko po na base po sa ating batas hindi po tayo pwede mag-approve ng isang budget para sa isang bagay na hindi pa nag-eexist (I will clarify that based on our laws, we cannot approve a budget for something that does not yet exist),” Velasco said in Facebook post.\n",
      "“Dahil sa panahon na prinopose at in-approve ang budget for COVID-19 vaccine ay kasalukuyan pa lamang pong ginagawa ito at tinitest ng ibat ibang kumpanya at scientists sa buong mundo (The budget for the COVID-19 vaccine was developed and approved while it is still being done and tested by various companies and scientists around the world),” he added.\n",
      "The ordinance has been approved by the City Council on October 5. During that time, the vaccines developed by various pharmaceutical companies worldwide were still under the final stages of clinical trials. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Sen. Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara assured Thursday that the P70-billion unprogrammed budget for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines that Congress allocated under the proposed P4.5-trillion national budget for 2021 can be considered “solid funding.”\n",
      "Sen. Sonny Angara (Joseph Vidal/ Senate PRIB)\n",
      "Angara made this assurance following concerns of other lawmakers that only P2.5-billion of the P72.5-billion allocated for the purchase of the vaccines has immediate funding, while the bulk of the funds will be lodged as standby funds.\n",
      "“The P70-billion is solid funding also, and just because it’s under the unprogrammed funds doesn’t mean it’s not solid funding,” Angara said in an ANC interview.Angara explained these funds are not dependent just on tax collections.\n",
      "“In fact, it’s not tax collections. It’s non-tax collections or non-fiscal collections so meaning that’s the fees you collect like at the LTO (Land Transportation Office) and things like that, the fees the treasury collects on interests,” he said.\n",
      "Angara also said that the country’s economic managers themselves have, likewise, assured that the P70-billion budget is “very reachable.”\n",
      "But if the government is able to buy a vaccine priced at P600, Angara said an estimated 100 million Filipinos and more can be vaccinated against the coronavirus.That is because, he said, on top of the P72.5-billion for the vaccines under the budget, an additional P10-billion will be funded under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act or Bayanihan 2.\n",
      "“So if you add that to the P72.5-billion here in the 2021 budget, you are talking about P82.5 billion, and if you are talking about a vaccine that you can obtain at around P600, you are talking about over 100 million persons getting vaccinated,” Angara said.\n",
      "Such budget, he said, “would seem sufficient,” but certain variables may play in the procurement.“There are questions that you and I cannot decide or solve because we don’t have the available information. What are these pieces of information? How much has been promised to us as supply? When will it arrive? Things like that. Where will it be stored?” he said.\n",
      "“These are things that are all moving targets because there are so many factors at play. All governments of the world are talking to the vaccine manufacturers, trying to obtain adequate supply,” he said.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. had earlier said that the government hopes to vaccinate 60 to 70 percent of Filipinos against COVID-19. According to Galvez, such percentage is enough to trigger herd immunity within three to five years.\n",
      "Thus, Angara said the proposed budget for the vaccines could be enough to meet this target.\n",
      "“If we are looking at the indicative figure of 60 percent – I think that was the figure discussed, 60 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated – then I think there are sufficient funds there,” he noted.Sen. Pia Cayetano, vice chairperson of the Senate Committee on Finance, assured Wednesday that the panel took into consideration the prices of the COVID-19 vaccines the government will procure before they pass the 2021 national budget measure.\n",
      "“As (it was) correctly pointed out, the vaccines range in prices, anywhere from P610, that is the AstraZeneca brand, for the two doses, that is the cheapest,” Cayetano manifested during the Senate plenary session.\n",
      "She said the most expensive vaccine is by Sinopharm priced at P8,845 for two doses. Next was Moderna’s at P4,500 each.\n",
      "“So, let’s just use the P610 one, which is the cheapest. Let me first point out that time and again, the IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force) and also DoH (Department of Health) told us that the objective really is to get from different brands,” Cayetano said.\n",
      "But the biggest issue, she pointed out, is the country’s access to the vaccines.\n",
      "“So inasmuch as WHO (World Health Organization) states that 60 to 70 percent of the population should be vaccinated for herd immunity, the question is how soon can we access vaccines to cover the 60-70 percent?”\n",
      "“And I think the best target that I heard, this may have changed, I agree with everyone that it is fluid. The closest we might be able to get is 25 percent,” Cayetano said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a tweet called the announcement good news, but warned: “It doesn’t mean we can let our guards down” against the spread of the Covid-19 illness as a second wave forced several regions to reintroduce restrictions.The government’s chief medical advisor Supriya Sharma said the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot “marks a critical milestone in our efforts to bring Covid-19 under control.”\n",
      "She said additional vaccines would become available and be rolled out throughout 2021, with three other vaccine candidates — including one developed by US-based Moderna, which could be delivered later this month — currently being evaluated by health authorities.\n",
      "These, she said, will provide “every Canadian with the opportunity to be immunized.”\n",
      "The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had undergone a fast-tracked review while it was still in clinical trials, which concluded that it met “stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements for use in Canada,” said the country’s health department, Health Canada.The Gulf kingdom of Bahrain has also approved the vaccine.\n",
      "Marc Berthiaume, director of Health Canada’s bureau of medical science, said its evaluation found “strong evidence that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.”\n",
      "The regulator advised, however, that it should be used only in people 16 years of age and up, for now.Canada had pre-ordered 20 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine when it was still in development, with an option for 56 million additional doses.\n",
      "Trudeau said on Monday that as many as 249,000 doses would be received in December.\n",
      "The first shipments to 14 sites across Canada are scheduled to arrive Monday with people receiving shots a day or two later, according to Major-General Dany Fortin, a war-hardened commander put in charge of coordinating distribution.\n",
      "Health care workers and vulnerable populations including the elderly are to be the first to receive it.\n",
      "– 95 percent effective –\n",
      "The federal government concluded pre-orders with several other pharmaceutical companies — including AstraZeneca, Sanofi and GSK, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson, Medicago and Moderna — for a total of 400 million doses, to ensure it eventually gets what it needs for its population of 38 million.By September 2021, Trudeau said, most Canadians should be inoculated.\n",
      "Thousands of Britons became the first in the Western world to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Tuesday at the start of the biggest global vaccination drive in more than half a century.\n",
      "The vaccine — which proved to be 95 percent effective in late-stage clinical trials — is administered in two doses, 21 days apart.\n",
      "British health officials, however, warned on Wednesday that anyone with a history of significant allergic reactions should not get it right away, after two people suffered allergic reactions and needed treatment.\n",
      "Canadian authorities also advised people with allergies to the vaccine ingredients specifically to also hold off as they investigate.US giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech called Canada’s interim order for its emergency use “a historic moment in our collective fight against the Covid-19 pandemic” and “a major step towards returning to normalcy in Canada.”\n",
      "They will continue providing data on its use for ongoing evaluation, said Health Canada.\n",
      "Fortin said the distribution of the vaccine — which must be stored in extreme sub-zero temperatures — will be a “mobilization effort of massive proportion.”\n",
      "He and his team have been doing a “dry run” to test the ultra-cold storage delivery chain, flying boxes from Belgium and handing them off to health care workers.\n",
      "On Friday, a full dress rehearsal is planned to firm up the responsibilities of each person in the chain.\n",

      "“Great to see Matron May Parsons, originally from the Philippines, deliver the world’s first vaccine shot. Our NHS (National Health Service) is proud to have such dedicated health worker,” Nigel Adams, Minister of State for Asia at the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, said in a tweet on Tuesday.In another tweet, British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce described as a “fantastic moment” the historic first anti-COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine injected by Parsons to Margaret Keena, a grandmother of four, during the pilot launch in the United Kingdom.“A fantastic moment! And great to see that the vaccine is administered by Nurse May Parsons from the Philippines – one of the many thousands of Filipino healthcare workers making such an enormous contribution to the NHS (National Health Service),” Pruce said.In a photo released by the British news platform Sky News, Parsons was shown injecting Keenan with Pfizer/BioNTech-made vaccine, the first to be given to someone outside a clinical trial.Parsons told the British media it was a “huge honor” to be the first in the country to deliver the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to a patient.\n",
      "“The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel,” Parsons was quoted as telling Sky News.It was learned that Parsons has been working in the NHS sector for the last 24 years and connected at the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire since 2003.\n",

      "(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "This was revealed today by Senator Grace Poe during a TV interview as chairmen of the Senate and House of Representatives bicameral conference committee panels are still attempting to iron out the differing provisions of their GAB versions.‘’So there’s quite a bit. Of course we still need more, but there’s P83 billion allotted for that. And then we also added for contact tracers. We put more, let’s say, for PCR testing and then P3 billion for PPEs (personal protective equipment), P4.5 billion for increasing hospital capacity. And then P13.5 billion for risk allowance of health workers,’’ she explained.\n",
      "Poe said the P83 billion is an accumulation of the Senate’s ability to transfer funds from other departmentsto the vaccine purchase program because of their absorptive capacity problems, among others.\n",
      "‘’And we need those frontliners, we need the response, we need the vaccine, we need the testing, and the PPEs, etc,’’ she said.\n",
      "The House had a P5.5 billion appropriation for the purchase of vaccine based on its version of the budget.\n",
      "Senator Panfilo M. Lacson, an anti-pork barrel advocate, earlier said that there are less than P400 billion ‘’lump sums’’ or re-appropriated sums embedded in the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) budget.Lump sum appropriations had been declared as illegal by the Supreme Court.\n",
      "Poe also said the Senate also lopped off P49 billion from the proposed 2021 budget of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) of P143 billion based on the National Expenditure Program (NEP).The reason,according to Poe, is that DOTr has had a track record of having difficulty utilizing or absorbing their budget and actually spending it.\n",
      "‘’We trimmed it down to about P94 billion. That’s how much we took out. And the reason is most of those projects that they lodged in the DOTr was for rail. And seeing the face of what they needed for that, and the demand on other things, like COVID response, we thought that the DOTr won’t be able to spend it anyway next year. All of that, so we moved it,’’ she explained. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

Obviously, they should be given vaccines so they can continue their work without hesitation. They are our frontliners in the fight against COVID-19. It is natural they should be given protection against the virus),” he added.\n",

      "Roque said the country’s senior citizens would be prioritized next since they belong to the group vulnerable to the coronavirus. “Sila ang madaling kapitan ng virus dahil mayroon silang comorbidities. At kapag kinapitan, alam natin na sang-ayon sa datos, marami talaga ang namamatay sa ating mga seniors (They are vulnerable to the virus because they have comorbidities.

      "Nonetheless, Roque said it is still up to the President to make the decision on the matter, adding he won’t second guess Duterte.\n",
      "Shortly after Russia announced regulatory approval of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine last August, the President accepted Moscow’s offer to supply the life-saving drug to the country and offered to take the first shot as a gesture of his trust and gratitude. He even expressed willingness to be vaccinated in public to allay any fears about the safety of the drug.Roque said the President’s readiness to take the coronavirus shot still stands.\n",

Let’s hope she can be a guinea pig,” he said.\n",
      "With the recent breakthroughs in vaccine development, the government has already outlined plans for the vaccine acquisition and distribution once available in the market. Around P73 billion will be raised to pay for the vaccination of 60 million Filipinos.Among the priority beneficiaries of the free vaccines will be health frontliners, the poor, and uniformed personnel.\n",
      "The President has also granted authority to the FDA director general to issue emergency use authorization for coronavirus vaccines and treatments.

Hanggang banned pa po ang tourist visas, I don’t think there can be a way for them to come in (Let’s be frank so there will be no expectations.

      "Roque, however, asked concerned groups to be patient as he linked the government’s possible easing of travel ban on foreign tourists to the availability of coronavirus vaccines.\n",

The task force also gave the green light to the entry of former Filipino citizens, including their spouses and children, regardless of age, who are traveling with them.The government has required the travelers allowed visa-free entry to pre-book a quarantine facility and coronavirus test at an airport laboratory as a precaution against the illness. They will also be subject to the maximum capacity of inbound passengers at the port and date of entry.\n",

      "In our own small way and through the help and support of my tireless vice mayor, Honey Lacuna, no Manilan, will spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day on an empty stomach. ‘Walang nganga,’ or so the street jargon goes.All families in Manila numbering about 650,000 will be receiving food packs that they can put atop their tables and share on the special days for us Filipinos.\n",
      "As of this writing, these food packs may already be ready for distribution in the city’s various districts.\n",
      "We may not be able to shoulder everything but at the very least, we in the city government would just like Manilans to know and feel that there is a city government at work and concerned about their welfare.\n",
      "Knowing that all families have something to share and that no stomach will be empty on Christmas Day is enough to make us in the local government happy. If a family does not have any money, they can set aside maybe 70 percent of the food items and use them either on Christmas Eve or Day itself.Another good news that we have for Manilans is that we in the city government have already increased the budget allocation for the purchase of vaccines against COVID-19, the moment it becomes available in the market.\n",
      "Once the opportunity arrives, these vaccines will be our gift for all Manilans and I thank Vice Mayor Honey and the city councilors for their help. This will be on top of what the national government is planning to do.\n",
      "From the P200 million we allotted about four or five months ago, the budget is increased to P250 million after we decided to cancel road projects and realign the budget for vaccine purchase instead. Our priority is the health of the city’s population instead of good roads.Fortunately, yours truly happens to have connections with companies making the vaccines so that we were able to communicate with them as early as possible to ensure that we will be able to purchase vaccines as soon as they are certified by proper authorities.\n",

      "The country must be prepared to handle the storage of COVID-19 vaccines, House Deputy Speaker Surigao del Sur Rep. Johnny Pimentel said Sunday.\n",
      "(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Pimentel underscored the need to keep such vaccines at low temperatures during storage or else their efficacy might get compromised.“The vaccination of an initial batch of 35 million Filipinos is bound to call for the mobilization of a wide-range of cold storage assets – from temperature-controlled refrigerated trucking services to ample supplies of dry ice. The logistical challenge is enormous, considering that everybody will need two shots of the vaccine at an interval of 19 to 42 days,” said Pimentel, a COVID-19 survivor.\n",
      "He noted that the most promising COVID-19 vaccine is reputed to be 95 percent effective, but has to be stored in ultra-low temperature packed in dry ice.American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which jointly developed the vaccine with German biotech firm BioNTech SE, has designed distribution containers that can keep the shots at the required temperature of negative 70 degrees Celsius for 10 days if unopened.The distribution containers can also be used for temporary storage in a vaccination facility, such as a hospital, for up to 30 days as long as they are reloaded with dry ice every five days. Once thawed, the vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator at two to eight degrees Celsius for up to five days.As such, Pimentel said the COVID-19 immunization campaign in country will require the comprehensive listing of all available cold chain logistics solutions that can be marshaled to rapidly deploy the vaccines.“This early, we would expect our Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management ofEmerging Infectious Diseases to make an inventory of all obtainable cold storage provisions, including those held by private firms, that can be harnessed to deliver the vaccines across the country without delay,” he said.“We have to be geared up to cope, if we want to swiftly vaccinate millions of Filipinos, especially the most vulnerable ones such as our healthcare workers, those aged 65-years-old and above and those with underlying ailments,” added the solon, who also serves as Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) spokesman.At present, the Department of Health (DoH) has only one bulk cold storage facility at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa City.While the DoH has a long-term plan to put up regional cold storage warehouses as part of its modern supply chain for temperature-sensitive medical supplies, Pimentel expressed concern that the facilities may not be built in time for the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.“We may have to rely on cold chain solutions that are already available,” he said.The United Kingdom on Dec. 2 became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in a COVID-19 public inoculation program. The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to consider on Dec. 10 the possible approval of the same vaccine for emergency use in America. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The House Assistant Majority Leader said the government could seek the support of Philippine Airlines (PAL) and other domestic air carriers in transporting the vaccines.“I am assuming that we will get the vaccines from where they are being produced. Instead of foreign carriers, let us use local airlines to help them earn more at this time of pandemic so they would keep their employees,” she said in a statement.Noting that it would take more than 50 Boeing 777 freighters to fly 60 million doses to Manila, tapping foreign airlines in the transport of vaccines should also be considered in the event that the country’s air carriers fail to meet the requirements, the House leader said.\n",
      "She noted that aside from PAL, other major domestic airlines such as AirAsia Philippines and Cebu Pacific could play a big role in the transportation of vaccines to the regions, provinces, cities, and towns.\n",
      "“The government can help them avoid shedding more manpower if it can engage their services in the delivery of the vaccine,” she said.\n",
      "Castelo also cited anew the need for the government to start preparing cold storage facilities for storing and safekeeping of COVID-19 vaccines in anticipation of their arrival and mass distribution to the Filipino people.She had earlier filed House Bill No. 8000 or the proposed “Vaccine-Ready Philippines Act of 2020” urging the government to amply prepare cold storage facilities for the vaccines.“Considering that our country is a populous nation and is an archipelago, a safe and effective mass distribution of the vaccine requires ample planning and preparation,” she said.\n",
      "HB No. 8000 tasks the Department of Health (DoH) to determine the specifications of the cold storage facility necessary for the anticipated COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“DoH shall urgently prepare for the provision of cold storage facilities in accordance with the specifications that are suitable for safekeeping of the anticipated COVID-19 vaccines,” the measure provides.Citing some accounts, Castelo said vaccines can be stable for 30 days at temperatures ranging from two degrees to eight degrees Celsius.\n",
      "“Establishing or finding safe storage facilities with such specification and standard in Metro Manila, the regions, and in provinces, cities, and towns will be a big challenge for the DoH,” she said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The monarch, 94, and her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip are in line to get the jab early due to their age and will not receive preferential treatment, the Mail on Sunday reported.\n",
      "The newspaper said Britain’s most senior royals would reveal they have been given the inoculation “to encourage more people to take up the vital jab”, amid fears so-called anti-vaxxers could dent enthusiasm for it.Britain on Wednesday gave emergency approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, with health officials set to use criteria based on age and vulnerability to decide the order of people to receive it.\n",
      "Elderly care home residents and their carers will be the very first to get inoculated, followed by those aged 80 and over and frontline health and care staff.\n",
      "Other elderly people and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be next, with the rest of the population then prioritised by age.\n",
      "Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Daily Mirror also reported a string of high-profile figures in Britain had committed publicly to getting the vaccine in a bid to boost take-up.\n",

      "Britain has pre-ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine in total, and is set to receive an initial batch of 800,000 to begin next week’s rollout.Regulators were forced to defend their world-first approval on Wednesday of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, insisting it met all safety standards after US and European officials queried the rapid process.\n",
      "Meanwhile, plans are reportedly being stepped up to ensure any complications arising from the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31 do not impact its roll-out.\n",
      "The vaccine will be manufactured at Pfizer’s plant in Puurs, Belgium, and needs to be transported in temperature-controlled thermal shippers that use dry ice.\n",

      "The WHO warned against complacency and what it said was an erroneous belief that because vaccines are on the near-horizon, the crisis is over.\n",
      "“Vaccines do not equal zero Covid,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual news conference.“Vaccines and vaccination will add a major, major, powerful tool to the tool kit that we have. But by themselves, they will not do the job.”\n",
      "Britain on Wednesday became the first Western country to approve a vaccine for general use, piling pressure on other countries to follow suit swiftly.\n",
      "WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that progress on vaccines “gives us all a lift and we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n",
      "“However, WHO is concerned that there is a growing perception that the pandemic is over.“Many places are witnessing very high transmission of the virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers.”\n",

      "A further 163 candidate vaccines are being developed in laboratories with a view to eventual human trials.\n",
      "“I have seen vaccines transform the world and change the course of epidemics, and I fully expect that these vaccines and the ones that are to come will do that,” Ryan said.\n",

      "Health workers, the elderly and people with underlying conditions will get priority — a choice that “will take a lot of the sorrow out of this pandemic. But it will not, by itself, end transmission,” said Ryan.\n",

      "Senator Imee R. Marcos, chairwoman of the Senate economic affairs committee, disclosed that the Swedish pharmaceutical firm and Oxford University already decided to sell their vaccine at cost and for as long as needed by less developed countries.\n",
      "Marcos pointed out that the government, local corporate donors, and AstraZeneca signed a purchase agreement to acquire 2.6 million doses of the vaccine for about P600 million, or about $5 per dose.Marcos added that subsequent purchases of the same vaccine should cost less because the Philippines is also among the 92 low and lower-middle income countries that will benefit from international donor-funded vaccines under the global initiative known as the COVAX Advance Market Commitment facility.\n",
      "The COVAX AMC aims to keep vaccine prices at not more than $3 per dose, through the efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi Vaccine Alliance, and vaccine-manufacturing countries, so that poorer nations can gain affordable and fair access to Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“With a budget of P600 million, the government should be able to buy not just 2.6 million doses but at least five million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. At $5, every Filipino vaccinated should be able to complete the two prescribed doses, not just half,” Marcos said.\n",
      "Marcos cited Oxford’s statement issued last week, which partly reads: “A key element of Oxford’s partnership with AstraZeneca is the joint commitment to provide the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic across the world, and in perpetuity to low- and middle-income countries.”Marcos added that AstraZeneca has a local presence and has several manufacturing sites in China which would lower the cost of shipping the firm’s vaccines to the Philippines.\n",

      "Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography committee, wants to ensure access to safe and effective coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine for all Filipinos.\n",
      "Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go\n",
      "(OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "This after President Duterte signed yesterday Executive Order 121 which allows the Director-General of the Food and Drug Administration to issue Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the COVID-19 drugs and vaccines,\n",
      "With the EUA, the process of approving the use of COVID-19 vaccines from abroad would be expedited, Go explained.“Napirmahan na po ni Pangulong Duterte ‘yung (EO allowing the issue of) Emergency Use Authorization, so ngayon, mas mabilis na ang proseso. Mas mabilis makakagalaw ang FDA. Ito ang inaantay ng FDA kasi merong vaccine na dumaan na sa clinical trial sa ibang bansa at gusto nila magbenta dito sa atin. Ito ay papayagan thru EUA,’’ he said. (President Duterte has already signed the (EO allowing the issue of) Emergency Use Authorization, the process is now faster. The FDA could move faster. The FDA has been waiting for this after a vaccine underwent clinical trial in other countries and they want to sale it to us here. This would be allowed thru EUA.)\n",
      "“Sisiguraduhin po ng FDA na safe po ang vaccine at ‘yung efficacy ng vaccine na ito dahil hindi po basta basta papayag ang taumbayan na turukan ng vaccine kung di sila sigurado na safe sila,’’ he added. (The FDA would ensure that the vaccine is safe and effective because the people would not easily want to be inoculated unless they are sure that they are safe.)\n",
      "Go said that it does not matter where the vaccine would come from as long as it is safe and effective.\n",
      "In addition, Go had discussed with Carlito G. Galvez Jr., the chief implementer of the National Action Plan Against COVID-19 (NAP), that the acquisition of the vaccines from international companies, such as Gamaleya, Moderna and Pfizer, would be done by phases.\n",
      "“So ang tanging isyu dito ay dapat maging safe muna bago nila ibigay, walang papayag na magpa-inject kung di sigurado na safe. Buhay ng bawat Pilipino ang nakataya dito, di natin makukumbinsi ang mga Pilipino kung di tayo siguradong safe ang vaccine na ituturok sa kanila,’’ he said. (So, the only issue here is the safety of the vaccine before using it, nobody wants to be injected with it if there is no assurance that it is safe. The lives of the Filipinos are at stake here, we cannot convince the Filipinos to have it if we are not sure that the vaccine to be injected to them is safe.)\n",
      "“Ito ang napag-usapan namin ni DOH Secretary (Francisco) Duque (III) and Secretary Galvez na kapag nadeklara na itong safe ng FDA, uunahin natin ang mahihirap, uunahin natin ang mga vulnerable,’’ he stressed. (This is what I have discussed with DOH Secretary Duque and Sec. Galvez that once this is declared as safe by the FDA, we will prioritize the poor and the vulnerable sectors.)\n",
      "“Uunahin rin natin ang mga frontliners, mga nagtatrabaho sa panahong ito tulad ng mga medical workers, militar at PNP. And, of course mga guro, kasi kung magbubukas na tayo ng klase sa susunod na taon, sila ang kailangan na safe po dahil haharap sila sa mga estudyante,’’ he added. (We would also prioritize the frontliners, the medical workers, military and PNP. And of course the teachers, because if we would open the classes next year, they have to be safe because they would face the students.)\n",
      "As for the budget, Go said that sufficient funds should be allocated for the procurement, storage and distribution of the vaccines.\n",
      "He reminded concerned officials to ensure that public funds are used properly and the right processes are followed.\n",
      "“Kailangan natin meron tayong pondo dahil magrereserba po tayo nito. At ipinaalala po ni Pangulong Duterte sa finance managers natin na siguraduhing magkaroon ng due diligence. Bago bayaran, siguraduhing makakadeliver sila. Bago bigyan ng downpayment, siguraduhing ito po ang timetable at makakarating at mauuna sa mahihirap nating kababayan,’’ he added. (We need to have funds because we would be making reservations. President Duterte has reminded our finance managers to ensure that there would be due diligence. Before paying, there should be an assurancethat they could deliver. Before giving the downpayment, be sure that it would be delivered on or before the agreed timetable.)

      "Angel Urena, Clinton’s press secretary, told CNN the former president would also be up for getting a vaccine in public on television.\n",
      "Later in the day, Biden told CNN in an interview that he, too, would be willing to be vaccinated in public after government approval of vaccines, specifically saying he would rely on Fauci to say it was safe.“It’s important to communicate to the American people it’s safe,” the 78-year-old said. “It’s safe to do this.”\n",

      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that a vaccine for COVID-19 may become available in the Philippines by March 2021.\n",
      "(Daniel Schludi / UNSPLASH / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "FDA Director-General Rolando Enrique Domingo said that this is a possibility amid the recent developments in the United Kingdom, United States of America, and other countries. Previously, the government said that COVID-19 vaccines may reach the Philippines by the second quarter of next year.\n",
      "He also added that the process of approving a vaccine will be shortened—from six months to 21-28 days—after President Duterte issued an executive order allowing the FDA to grant an emergency use authorization (EUA) to possible COVID-19 vaccines that will enter the country.The United Kingdom has approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 candidate vaccine for emergency use. Meanwhile, Pfizer and Moderna are now also in the process of securing an EUA from US health regulators, said Domingo.\n",
      "Domingo said that pharmaceutical companies may apply for an EUA in the Philippines after they secure an EUA from their respective governments.\n",
      "“Kapag nag-apply po sila dito sa atin, then maaring by first few weeks of January ay meron na rin po tayong maibigay na emergency use authorization at baka mapaaga ng kaunti or baka magkaroon ng chance na baka mga March ay magkaroon na ng bakuna dito sa Pilipinas [If they apply to us, then maybe by the first few weeks of January we will also be able to provide them an emergency use authorization. Also, there may be a chance that by March we will have a vaccine here in the Philippines],” said Domingo during the Malacanang press briefing.\n",
      "The FDA chief said that those who already secured an EUA from the other countries would likely apply in the Philippines.“Ang mauuna siguro yung mga mayroon nang EUA [from other countries] katulad ng Pfizer, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Moderna, AstraZeneca. Ito po ay mga nag-apply na. Kapag nag-apply na po sila sa atin, within 21 to 28 days ay mabibigyan po natin ng desisyon kung approved or disapproved ang kanilang application [Those who already have EUA [from other countries] like Pfizer, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Moderna, AstraZeneca will probably come first. These are the ones who have already applied. When they apply to us, within 21 to 28 days we can give a decision if their application is approved or disapproved],” said Domingo.\n",
      "Domingo said it “will be up to the decision of the program implementers” on who should be prioritized to receive the vaccines once already available.\n",
      "He also added that the Department of Health (DOH) is now gearing to come up with an educational campaign about the potential risk and benefits of vaccines, noting that vaccination is not mandatory.“Hindi po kayo pwedeng pilitin, hindi pwedeng sapilitan. Kapag tayo ay nagpabakuna kailangan naiintidihan natin kumpleto kung ano ang benepsiyo nito at kung ano ang posibleng adverse events or side effects [You cannot force a person to be vaccinated.

      "(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "According to Domingo, the coronavirus vaccines like those developed by Pfizer, Moderna, Sinovac, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca could apply for emergency use authorization (EUA) in the Philippines after they secure an equivalent EUA from concerned government and health authorities abroad.\n",
      "The issuance of EUA will hasten the processing period for approving the coronavirus vaccine to 21 to 28 days from six months, according to Domingo.The health official made the remarks after citing that the United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) may authorize the emergency use of coronavirus vaccines developed Pfizer and Moderna within one to two weeks. The United Kingdom became the first Western nation to grant emergency approval to the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech and will reportedly roll out the first batch of doses next week.\n",
      "“Ang ibig sabihin nito, itong mga kompanyang ito kapag sila na-approve nasa America or sa UK, maaaring naghahanda na sila sa pag-aapply sa iba’t-ibang bansa tulad ng Pilipinas. kapag nag-apply sila dito sa atin, then maaring by first few weeks of January mayroon na tayong maibgay na EUA (This means that once these companies secure an approval in the United States or United Kingdom, they are likely preparing to apply in other countries like the Philippines. If they apply in the country, then we can give EUA in the first few weeks of January),” Domingo said during a virtual Palace press briefing.\n",
      "“At baka mapaaga na kaunti, baka magkaroon ng chance ng mga March ay magkaroon ng bauna dito sa Pilipinas (It may arrive earlier, there might be a chance the Philippines can have the vaccines by March),” he said.\n",
      "Prior to Domingo’s remarks, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said President Duterte wanted the government’s COVID immunization program to begin earlier than the projected second quarter of 2021. Roque asked Domingo if the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine would be possible in the first quarter of 2021.Asked by Roque if the vaccines can be made available as early as January, Domingo agreed that this was possible. The FDA official however made clear that the country’s vaccine supply will depend on the amount of drug production by the foreign pharmaceutical firms.\n",
      "“Magiging depende na lang ito sa production, kung mayroon mailalalaan na supply para sa Pilipinas atmaide-deliver agad sa atin para ma-distribute natin (It will now depend on the production, if they can set aside a supply for the Philippines, deliver them to us so we can distribute them),” Domingo said.Asked about the possible vaccines that may be given EUA in the country, Domingo said these drugs must already have an equivalent emergency use authority from its origin country, a stringent regulatory authority or the World Health Organization. He said this will be the government’s primary requirement for vaccines applying for EUA in the country.President Duterte earlier granted authority to the FDA director general to issue EUA for coronavirus vaccines and treatments. The latest move aims to accelerate the the availability and use of such vaccines in the absence of available alternatives.\n",
      "In evaluating EUA applications, the FDA director general is authorized to implement reliance and recognition process for the emergency use of drugs and vaccines.The FDA can also convene a panel of experts to conduct a review of data on the safety and efficacy of a COVID-19 drug or vaccine applying for an EUA.

      "He has issued Executive Order No. 121 granting authority to the FDA director general to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for drugs and vaccines that may prevent, diagnose, or treat coronavirus but with certain conditions.\n",
      "The regulatory practice of EUA issuance aims to hasten the availability and use of coronavirus drugs and vaccines in the absence of available approved and adequate alternatives.“It is a priority of the State to ensure that the lives of the Filipino people, especially the underprivileged, poor, and marginalized, our frontliners, healthcare providers, police officers and soldiers, and those in the essential services shall be protected from COVID-19 by ensuing accessibility and adequacy of supply of related drugs and vaccines,” Duterte said in the order.\n",
      "The Health department had earlier asked the President to allow the FDA to grant EUA for coronavirus vaccines and drugs that will shorten the approval process to 21 days from usual six months. The emergency use authorization was sought following the recent breakthroughs in the vaccine development by foreign drug manufacturers.\n",
      "Under the EO, the President set the following conditions for the issuance of EUA:\n",
      "1. Based on the totality of evidence available, including data from adequate and well-known controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the drug or vaccine may be effective to prevent, diagnose, or treat COVID-19;2. The known and potential benefits of the drug or vaccine when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat COVID-19 outweighs the known and potential risks of the drug or vaccine, if any; and;\n",
      "3. There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the drug or vaccine for COVID-19.\n",
      "“Outside clinical trials and except in cases where a Compassionate Special Permit is issued, no unregistered COVID-19 drug and vaccine may be manufactured, sold, imported, exported, distributed, or transferred without an EUA,” Duterte said.EO 121 also stated any application for EU must comply with “good manufacturing practices” and accompanied by an underlying by the manufacturer to complete the development of the drug and vaccine.\n",
      "In evaluating EUA applications, the FDA director general will have the power to implement reliance and recognition process for the emergency use of drugs and vaccines.\n",
      "“For this purpose, the FDA director general may accept the regulatory decision of the WHO (World Health Organization), US-CDC (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), or other internationally recognized and established regulatory authorities,” Duterte said.\n",
      "The President also allowed the FDA to convene a panel to conduct a review of data on the safety and efficacy of a COVID-19 drug or vaccine applied for an EUA. The panel will be composed of excerpts on drug and vaccine development.\n",
      "“After the review, the panel shall submit to the FDA Director General its report and recommendations on the application for EUA.”\n",
      "Any issuance of EUA will be valid only within the duration of the declared public health emergency due to the coronavirus. The FDA director general may revisit or revoke the EUA as appropriate to protect public health and safety.\n",
      "The order also allowed the FDA to conduct “post-authorization monitoring” to track product deployment, additional relevant information, and the status from the manufacturer on the product’s life cycle.\n",
      "“The holder of an EUA shall be required to complete specific pharmacovigilance obligations, with a view to providing comprehensive data confirming a positive benefit-risk balance.”\n",

      "To be clear, there won’t be one single set of rules for the whole nation.\n",
      "At the risk of creating confusion, which was the case during the vaccine campaign against the H1N1 flu in 2009, the federal government only makes recommendations to states, who decide for themselves how to distribute the doses and who gets priority.Panels of top experts have already delivered their opinions, which diverge in certain key respects and reveal the tension at the center of the debate: vaccines should both protect the most vulnerable and help facilitate a return to normal.It’s on the question of jumpstarting the economy as quickly as possible that the US may set itself apart.\n",
      "France’s top health authority recommended starting with retirement home residents and employees who work there, followed by the elderly and health care workers, then the over-50s, people whose jobs put them at risk, medically high-risk people, the poor, and finally the rest of the population.That’s the approach recommended by the World Health Organization and adopted by a number of rich countries, Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told AFP.\n",
      "In the US, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) compiled a more than 200-page report suggesting frontline health care workers are given the vaccine first, then first responders such as paramedics, police and firefighters.\n",
      "Next would come people with two or more underlying conditions (including the likes of cancer, obesity and diabetes), whatever their age, then the two million people in nursing homes.\n",
      "– Keeping the country running –\n",
      "For the next phase, NASEM emphasizes less age and more profession, prioritizing “critical” workers who keep the country running.\n",
      "These include teachers, workers from slaughterhouses to the supermarkets who keep Americans fed, and those who drive buses and trains, sell them their medicine, maintain order, or deliver mail and parcels.\n",
      "People in these jobs are often minority Hispanics or Black, and have been hit disproportionately by the pandemic.\n",
      "After these tens of millions of workers, the next on the list could be people who have one underlying condition, the homeless, prisoners, and people over 65 without comorbidities.\n",
      "Younger adults and students, who are at lower risk of severe disease but have been major spreaders of the virus, would come next, ahead of the rest of the population.\n",
      "This is only a proposal. The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) are awaiting the opinion of their own expert committee, which will vote on Tuesday.This committee has previously suggested that it could prioritize health care personnel and critical workers, because immunizing them will provide a “multiplier effect”: not only are they essential cogs in the health response and the economy, but they are in contact with a lot of people. In practice, these ethical, epidemiological and economic considerations may be ignored in the initial rush on doses.Problems remain to be solved: though it may be easy to target retirement homes and hospitals, how are pharmacists and doctors supposed to confirm that a person is indeed an essential worker, or that they have two underlying conditions? In addition, the Trump administration has said it will not be bound by the advice of its scientists and that retirement homes will receive Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines as early as mid-December in the event of a regulatory green light.

      "The Department of Health (DoH) bared a few weeks ago that clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines would start as early as this December.“If we do not yet have these vaccines and means of cold storage, the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) should find ways to manufacture the vaccines and cold containers on a massive scale, along with the production of tens of millions of syringes and other supplies needed,” said Uy, a vice chairperson of the Committee on Appropriations.\n",
      "“Some of the COVID-19 vaccines could be produced in the industrial estates like PHIVIDEC under license from the original manufacturers,” she noted. PHIVIDEC is located in Misamis Oriental.\n",
      "Uy said the country would also need areas where enough vaccines and supplies can be stored on standby for future needs.\n",
      "“We must anticipate vaccination of migrant balikbayans; returning OFWs (overseas Filipino workers); foreign tourists; crews of international airlines, passenger ships, and cargo ships; personnel of foreign embassies, international regional headquarters; and visiting foreign troops,” she said.

      "The Senate is putting a premium on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines under the proposed P4.5-trillion national budget for 2021 to enable the government to successfully combat the pandemic.\n",
      "(Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, chair of the Senate Committee on Finance and sponsor of the General Appropriations Bill (GAB), made this assurance before the Senate approved the budget measure on third and final reading on Thursday.“Considering that we are still in the middle of a global pandemic, much of the increases the committee has made (in the budget) is in the health sector and with regards to our COVID-19 response,” Angara said when he presented Committee Report No. 135 on House Bill No. 7727.For the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, the Senate has set aside P54-billion for the acquisition of vaccines; P21-billion for the storage, transportation and distribution costs, and P8-billion that would be lodged under the office of the health secretary.The Upper Chamber allotted a significant P1-billion under the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) for the contact tracing operations to enable the agency to “recruit, train, deploy and support” contact tracers.“As we wait for these vaccines, we should remain vigilant, through social distancing and safety protocols,” Angara stressed.The Senate also allocated P15.741-billion for the continuous hiring of health workers and frontliners.Aside from this, senators also agreed to increase the capital outlay for DOH regional hospitals to P1.6-billion, giving P100-million for each region.The Senate also agreed to increase the budget for the health facilities and enhancement program (HFEP). Total budget for HFEP, including amendments, amounted to P6.497-billion (DOH-OSEC), plus an additional P4.518-billion.Senators also approved P462.443-million for the treatment of non-communicable diseases like heart disease, stroke, mental health, etc.) and P6.235-billion for communicable diseases.The budget bill for 2021 also included P1.03-billion allocation to support state colleges and universities (SUCs) with medical schools.However, Angara did not specify in his manifestation the Senate’s decision on the P19-billion anti-insurgency fund or the budget allocation for the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) which the Senate minority bloc has been proposing to be realigned to help fund the government’s COVID-19 response efforts and to aid the state’s relief and rehabilitation efforts following the typhoons that hit the country.The Senate President Vicente Sotto III, Angara and other senators have expressed their preference to keep the budget of the NTF-ELCAC intact. Angara earlier said the Duterte administration had indicated that the NTF-ELCAC program a priority.But the Senate has decided to augment the various policies and programs of the government with regards to disaster response and mitigation.The upper chamber allocated P21-billion for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (NDRRMF) and allocated P15-billion for the rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance program for local government units.“Our experience in the past few weeks has only underscored how we continue to be threatened by natural calamities,” Angara said.“This is why your committee has elected to augment different policies and programs with regards to our disaster response and mitigation,” he stressed.Senators who will lead the Senate’s bicameral conference committee meeting includes Angara, Senators Pia Cayetano, Cynthia Villar, Panfilo Lacson, Sherwin Gatchalian, Richard Gordon, Christopher Go, Imee Marcos, Risa Hontiveros, Grace Poe, and Francis Pangilinan.

      "The latest vaccine is the third to produce efficacy results, following the experimental drugs made by US-based Pfizer and Moderna. Both Western-developed vaccines reportedly showed more than 90 percent efficiency.\n",
      "The Philippine government recently identified P73.2 billion in funds to secure coronavirus vaccines for 60 million Filipinos. Talks with Pfizer and China’s Sinovac have been initiated for possible supply arrangements.Once the vaccines arrive in the country, the priority beneficiaries of the government’s free vaccines are the country’s health workers, soldiers, cops, essential workers, and the country’s poor and vulnerable citizens.\n",
      "According to Galvez, the government aims to attain “herd immunity” by vaccinating around 75 percent of the country’s population to effectively contain the outbreak. He noted that the government plans to acquire 25 million to 35 million vaccines every year until the herd immunity target is achieved.\n",
      "Asked why the government’s vaccination program might take two to three years, Galvez explained that there are some challenges related to vaccine supply and demand. Under the “best case scenario,” Galvez said the coronavirus vaccines may be rolled out in the country by the second quarter of 2021.Also, Galvez admitted that the country has limited cold storage facilities needed for the shipment of coronavirus vaccines. He noted that the government plans to conduct the immunization drive that can be handled by existing storage facilities. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "MOSCOW — Russia said Tuesday its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine is 95 percent effective and would be cheaper and easier to store than some alternatives, as the global race heats up to develop a jab.\n",
      "The announcement was the latest in a flurry of breakthroughs as several vaccine makers worldwide published preliminary data showing efficacy rates of 90 percent and higher.\n",

      "Countries are hoping to begin inoculating their populations by year’s end or in early 2021 to stop a pandemic that has claimed the lives of nearly 1.4 million people.Russia was one of the first to announce the development of a vaccine in August – dubbed Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite – but before the start of final clinical trials.\n",
      "In statement on Tuesday, the vaccine’s developers said preliminary data after trials involving thousands of volunteers showed “an efficacy of the vaccine above 95 percent” after a second dose.\n",
      "Russia’s health ministry, the state-run Gamaleya research centre and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said in the statement they expected the vaccine to record an even higher effectiveness after the next analysis.\n",
      "“No unexpected adverse events were identified as part of the research,” it said, though some of those vaccinated suffered short term effects including fever, weakness, fatigue, and headache.Less than $10 per dose The two-dose vaccine will be available on international markets for less than $10 (8.40 euros) per dose, they said, and will be free for Russian citizens.\n",
      "It can be stored at between two and eight degrees Celsius (between 35.6 and 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit), they said, instead of the temperatures far below freezing required for some other vaccines.\n",
      "Pharma giants Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their virus vaccine is 95 percent effective, while US company Moderna said last week early results showed its candidate was 94.5 percent effective.Western experts have in the past expressed concern over Russia’s vaccine, fearing that its development could be rushed. Several welcomed Tuesday’s announcement though they said more data was needed.\n",
      "“This is yet more good news demonstrating a high interim vaccine efficacy,” said Azra Ghani, an infectious diseases specialist at Imperial College London.\n",
      "“The lack of any serious adverse events in approximately 20,000 trial participants is also very encouraging,” she said.\n",
      "Russia has applied to the World Health Organization for accelerated registration and pre-qualification of the Sputnik V vaccine.\n",
      "President Vladimir Putin last week said that Russia had manufacturing agreements in place with China and India and encouraged Brazil and South Africa to also mass produce Russian-developed vaccines.The head of the RDIF, Kirill Dmitriev, said Tuesday that European Union member Hungary would also manufacture the Sputnik V vaccine.\n",

      "The country’s total infections on Tuesday stood at 2.14 million, the fifth-highest caseload in the world.\n",
      "But at 37,031, virus deaths are significantly lower than other badly hit countries, raising concerns that the authorities are downplaying the pandemic’s severity.\n",
      "Data published by Russia’s federal statistics service earlier this month indicated excess deaths of more than 117,000 year-on-year between March and September, suggesting that virus fatalities could be much higher.\n",
      "While Moscow remains the epicentre of Russia’s outbreak, the country’s poorly funded regions are taking the brunt of the second wave.\n",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova on Tuesday said that in six of Russia’s 85 regions, over 90 percent of hospital beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients were occupied.\n",

      "Covid-19 vaccine emergency approvals are around the corner, makers are preparing to ship millions of doses — and experts are trying to reassure the public that the record-breaking speed of development hasn’t compromised safety.\n",
      "One statistic that is key to these persuasive efforts is that almost all side effects from vaccines occur in the six weeks following immunization.\n",
      "Participants in the huge trials for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna-National Institutes for Health jabs, the two frontrunners expected to be greenlit in December, were monitored for two months after the second dose — a requirement of the US Food and Drug Administration.“There is a difference between fast and too fast,” Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health told AFP.\n",
      "Two months in fact covers the “overwhelming majority” of what are referred to as “adverse events,” he said.\n",
      "In ordinary times, the FDA requires six months of follow up.But if nothing is revealed in the first two months, it’s very rare to see anything in the next four — and the gravity of the public health crisis has altered the risk-benefit calculations.“At this point where we are in the pandemic, we have to think about not waiting for the perfect data, although I want the perfect data,” said Grace Lee, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford who is a member of an advisory committee on vaccines for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n",
      "The most reassuring thing about the current trials is their size: 44,000 volunteers for Pfizer, while Moderna has 30,000.\n",
      "Around half of the volunteers have so far been studied for at least two months.\n",
      "The FDA will therefore have safety data on tens of thousands of people, which is far more than the average of 6,700 people for other vaccines authorized in the past decade.\n",
      "– ‘Severe’ but not ‘serious’ –\n",
      "Both makers said that after two months of receiving their second dose, there were no “serious” side effects — those which put a patient’s life in danger, require hospitalization, or cause permanent disability.\n",
      "This category includes dangerous allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock), neurological problems, and of course death.\n",
      "What they did observe was fatigue, headaches, body aches, joint pain, redness and pain site of the jab, especially after the second dose.\n",
      "These “Level 3” or “severe” events, in medical jargon — resolved without hospitalization, occurred in only a few percent of people and are deemed acceptable.The FDA will nevertheless be studying much more detailed safety data than was communicated by the two makers in their press releases.\n",
      "Experts have so far been reassured by the apparent absence of “vaccine enhanced disease,” that is to say signs that the medicine made things worse not better, as was observed with a vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus in the 1960s.\n",
      "– Ongoing monitoring –\n",
      "After the possible authorizations, monitoring or “pharmacovigilance” efforts will continue for years.Well-established systems exist in the United States and in Europe to statistically detect any increase in serious medical events in the vaccinated population, and to confirm cause and effect.For influenza vaccines, for example, the CDC has detected a possible tiny increase in the number of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (where the immune system attacks the nervous system).\n",
      "And even among those rare cases, all happened within six weeks of inoculation, said Edward Belongia, a scientist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute who’s been researching flu vaccines for the CDC for 15 years.\n",
      "Post-authorization surveillance led to the withdrawal in 1999 of the first rotavirus vaccine in the United States, nine months after its authorization.Rare cases of bowel obstruction had been observed in young children two weeks after vaccination.\n",
      "In general, though monitoring leads to use restrictions on certain groups, rather than withdrawal, said Omer.\n",
      "Skepticism varies by country. In China, 88 percent of people polled by the journal Nature in June were ready to be vaccinated, compared to 59 percent in France and 55 percent in Russia.This summer, as suspicions arose that President Donald Trump was pressuring the FDA to approve a vaccine faster, some Americans became more hesitant.The trend has passed since he lost the election, according to an Ipsos poll conducted this month.

      "The government wanted to make sure the country will still have enough medical workers to attend to the needs of Filipinos, he added.“‘Yung 5,000, iyan po ay initial. Kung iyan po ay maubos in the second quarter at mayroon na namang bakuna, baka tanggalin na iyan altogether (The 5,000 (cap) is just initial. If it runs out in the second quarter and we already have a vaccine, it may be removed altogether),” he said during a Palace press briefing Tuesday.\n",
      "“Sinisiguro lang natin na hindi naman tayo mauubusan ng mga nurses, nursing assistants, at nursing aides na mayroong clinical experience dahil kung mawala iyong may clinical experience, sinong mag-aalaga sa atin kung tayo ay magkakasakit? (We are trying to ensure that we won’t run out of nurses, nursing assistants, and nursing aides with clinical experience because if we run out of those with clinical experience, who would take care of us if we get sick?),” he said.\n",
      "President Duterte recently allowed the overseas deployment of nurses and other health workers abroad starting January, 2021, but with a limit of 5,000 each year. The recommendation was made by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).\n",
      "The Palace explained that the President agreed to lift the deployment ban of health workers due to the decreasing coronavirus cases and the prospect of a coronavirus vaccine, among others. The President also recognized it was time to let the health care workers pursue a job that will help improve their lives.The deployment ban was imposed back in April to ensure the protection of the health workers as well as augment the country’s frontliners in the battle against the pandemic. The government later relaxed the restrictions, allowing health workers with complete documents as of March 8, and then adjusted the date to August 28, to leave the country.

      "A committee of the Food and Drug Administration meets on December 10 to decide on whether to green light the medicine.General Gustave Perna, chief operations officer for the government’s Operation Warp Speed, told reporters some 40 million doses of vaccine would be available by the end of December.That figure includes another vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institutes for Health, which announced some preliminary efficacy results last week and is also close to applying for emergency approval.\n",
      "The Pfizer vaccine has ultra-cold long-term storage requirements of -70 degrees Celsius, and the company has developed special containers with dry ice to keep it cool for up to 15 days.\n",
      "Perna said that 64 jurisdictions across the US — including the 50 states, territories like the capital Washington and Puerto Rico and Indian reservations — received their allocation numbers on Friday.\n",

      "Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto on Tuesday welcomed President Duterte’s decision for the government to pay in advance the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, but maintained that the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) should not be the one tasked for its procurement.\n",
      "Senator Ralph Recto (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "In statement, Recto said Duterte was “correct” in approving the prepayment of the coronavirus vaccines as “vaccines are not COD (cash-on-delivery) goods you can order from Lazada.”\n",
      "“They are not postpaid items, but prepaid. More so when there is a race among nations to acquire them, with the first batches already pledged to rich nations who have bankrolled their development,” he added.Recto said, however, that he hopes that the administration’s urgency to purchase the vaccines will be conveyed to the officials of the PITC “whose stint in office has so far been unblemished with success.”\n",
      "“Kung nahihirapan ngang bumili ng suka, bakuna pa kaya (If they are having a hard time buying vinegar, what more if they are asked to purchase vaccines)?” he said.\n",
      "Senators had said that the PITC should not be trusted for the purchase of the COVID-19 vaccines for the delays in its procurement, which make it appear that government agencies have been disbursing their allocations under the national budget.\n",
      "Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said P33.4 billion in funds from various years have been “sleeping” in the Department of Trade and Industry-attached corporation.Meanwhile, Recto said he hopes that the government will also pursue its vaccine supply deal with AstraZeneca “as their vaccine matches our wallet, reportedly the cheapest at $10 per person, and our weather, can be stored at home refrigerators.”“That will cut huge expenses for a cold chain, which the Pfizer vaccine would need as they have to be stored at -80 degrees Celcius —the infrastructure for which this tropical archipelago does not have,” he said.\n",
      "Recto earlier pushed for additional funding to cover the government’s expenses for storage, delivery and post-vaccination surveillance, as well as the increased coverage of the immunization.“Let us go for universal immunization. We cannot emerge out of this pandemic and recoup what we have lost if our society is divided between the Haves (may bakuna) and the Have Nots (at wala). ‘Sana all’ should be our fighting slogan,” he said.

      "Secretary Carlito Galvez, chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 and the country’s vaccine czar, said the government is in talks with British vaccine-maker Astrazeneca, China’s Sinovac, and the tandem of US-based biotechnology companies Pfizer and Germany-based BioNTech.\n",
      "“Nag-ne-negotiate na po tayo sa apat na malalaking kompanya kasama na po ang Sinovac from China, ‘yung AstraZeneca, at saka po ‘yung Pfizer (We are currently negotiating with big companies including Sinovac from China, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer),” Galvez told President Duterte in a televised Cabinet meeting aired on Monday night.According to Galvez, the vaccine deal with AstraZeneca is the closest to completion. He said an advance commitment could be made by November 30 for the supply of 20 million doses of their product.Once AstraZeneca’s vaccine becomes available in the market, the delivery of the country’s supply is set to commence in the second quarter of 2021.\n",
      "“Nakita natin ang AstraZeneca po, maganda po dahil non-profit at saka pinakamababa po ang kanyang presyo, more or less five dollars lang (We have seen that the AstraZeneca [vaccine] is really good because it is non-profit and they have the lowest price, costing more or less five dollars [per dose]),” he said.\n",
      "On the other hand, the negotiation with China’s Sinovac is being expedited through the intervention of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Inc.\n",
      "Galvez said the deal could be achieved through a G2G [government-to-government] financing.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the deal with Pfizer and BioNTech is also ongoing with local officials in talks with the country representatives of the two international companies.\n",
      "“Just in case makuha po natin ito, makakabuo po tayo ng 60 million next year (Just in case we secure these [deals], we will come up with 60 million [doses] next year),” Galvez said.Currently, the government’s vaccine expert panel (VEP) is analyzing 17 potential vaccines, of which, nine were already in the Phase 3 trial.Phase 3 trial involves the inoculation of a wide number of people to test the vaccine’s efficacy.Of the nine vaccines that are in the advanced stages of trial, five are expected to conduct clinical trials here in the Philippines, Galvez said.\n",
      "These are Sinovac, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson’s Hansen, Russia-based Gamaleya, and China’s CanSino.The race for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine is heating up as companies start to release the results of their trials.\n",

      "The Department of Finance (DOF) has identified three sources of funds for the procurement of the coronavirus vaccines that will be given to priority sectors.\n",
      "In a report to President Duterte, Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said the government would source the P73.2 billion COVID-19 vaccine fund from development banks, state-owned financial companies and partner countries.\n",
      "According to Dominguez, the government can obtain around P40 billion through “low-cost, long-term loans” from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank.Dominguez also said the government can tap another P20 billion from Land Bank of the Philippines, Development Bank of the Philippines and government-owned and controlled corporations.The remaining P13.2 billion will be sourced from bilateral negotiations with countries from where the vaccines would originate, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, the finance chief said.\n",
      "Dominguez added that the P73.2 billion vaccine fund will enable the government to inoculate 60 million Filipinos against the coronavirus based on an average vaccine cost of P1,200 per person.\n",
      "“Some [vaccine prices] are lower, some are higher so we don’t know exactly how much is the cost. But let say, $25 or P1,200, P73.2 billion is good for 60 million people to be vaccinated,” he said.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that inoculating 60 million Filipinos may enable the country to reach “herd immunity,” based on pronouncements from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",
      "“Herd immunity” is a vaccination term in which a population becomes protected from a particular virus after reaching a threshold or certain number of vaccinated people.\n",
      "Duque said that according to WHO, herd immunity can be acquired if 60 to 70 percent of the population is vaccinated, which means that with 60 million inoculated Filipinos the country would “pretty much arrest the spread” of the virus.\n",
      "President Duterte said the country’s poorest population, and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) will be among those to be given priority in the would-be government’s COVID-19 immunization drive. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“This invaluable collaboration will go a long way to ensure that enough transport capacity is in place for this historic and mammoth operation,” Director of UNICEF’s Supply Division Etleva Kadilli said in a statement.“We need all hands on deck as we get ready to deliver COVID-19 vaccine doses, syringes, and more personal protective equipment to protect front line workers around the globe. By protecting these workers, we are ultimately protecting the millions of children who depend on their critical services,” Kadili added.\n",
      "In collaboration with Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), UNICEF said it will coordinate the purchase and delivery for 92 low and lower middle-income economies as quickly and securely as possible.\n",
      "The agency underscored that it will continue to coordinate closely with logistics operators to minimize disruptions of delivery around the world.\n",
      "“The support of governments, partners, and private sector will be paramount to transport vaccines for deadly diseases such as measles, diphtheria, and tetanus, as well as for COVID-19, as efficiently as possible,” Kadilli said.UNICEF had earlier begun to stockpile more than one billion syringes to guarantee initial supply and preposition in advance the COVID-19 vaccines.\n",

      "President Duterte has been “10 steps ahead” while Vice President Leni Robredo was “a bit too late” in terms of preparing the list of beneficiaries of the coronavirus vaccines to be purchased by the government, Malacañang said Monday.\n",
      "(Joe Raedle / Getty Images / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the government has actually identified the recipients of its massive immunization drive as soon as the coronavirus vaccines became available even before Robredo made the suggestion to ready such list.\n",
      "“We don’t have to adopt the suggestion dahil mayroon na po kaming listahan (because we already have a list),” he said during a virtual press briefing.“Thank you very much again but again po a bit too late kasi si (it’s a bit too late because) Presidente Duterte po 10 steps ahead,” he added.\n",
      "Robredo recently suggested to the government to identify the beneficiaries of the potential coronavirus vaccine ahead of the distribution. She said it was important to prepare early for the vaccine distribution to avoid a repeat of lapses that marred the social amelioration program.\n",
      "She also found it important for the government to ready the budget for the cold storage facilities for the vaccines. She noted that the proposed 2021 national budget included allocation for the vaccine acquisition but not for the related logistics and storage requirements.\n",
      "Roque maintained that the government has made preparations for the acquisition and distribution of the coronavirus vaccines. Chief implementer of the national plan against the coronavirus Carlito Galvez Jr. has been designated by the President as vaccine czar to oversee such concern, he added.Under the government’s distribution plan, the priority recipients of the vaccines will be the health frontliners, soldiers, cops, essential workers, and the country’s poor.\n",
      "“Eto nanaman tayo. ‘Pag sinabi po ng Presidente 4Ps (Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program) beneficiary, ma’am Vice President, mayroon na pong listahan ‘yan (Here we go again. When the President 4Ps beneficiary, ma’am Vice President, we already have a list),” Roque said in a sarcastic tone about the Vice President’s latest suggestion.“Maraming salamat po sa suhestiyon pero as usual, nagawa na po ng gobyerno ‘yan kasi may listahan na tayo ng 4Ps, may listahan na tayo ng kapulisan, may listahan na tayo ng kasundaluhan (Thank you for the suggestion but as usual, the government already took action because we have a list of 4Ps beneficiaries, we have a list of policemen, and we have a list of our soldiers),” he said.As to the health frontliners, Roque said the Department of Health (DoH) is also aware of the medical personnel serving in the battle against the pandemic.\n",
      "Last week, the President agreed to make early payment to the suppliers of coronavirus vaccines to ensure the country’s supply.Galvez has been allowed to forge advance market commitments with the vaccine manufacturers. The vaccine purchase can be made through options such as a multilateral arrangement with World Bank and Asian Development Bank as the finance manager as well as Private-Public Tripartite Agreement.\n",
      "Government officials are reportedly in talks with China, United Kingdom, and the United States for possible supply deals. Galvez said the country could be assured of 30 to 50 million coronavirus vaccines by next year. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Vice President Leni Robredo has suggested that the list of the first recipients and the budget for the storage of the expected vaccine against the coronavirus disease be prepared ahead of its distribution.\n",
      "Vice President Leni Robredo (OVP / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Robredo, in her weekly radio show, cited her previous briefing with health officials regarding the disposition of vaccine where she suggested that the names of those to be prioritized like the indigents and health workers must be listed down.“Iyong naalala ko, uunahin iyong mga healthcare workers, tapos iyong mga indigents. Basta lima yata o anim na prioritization, okay iyon. Pero iyong sabi ko, ang suggestion ko, pangalanan na (From what I remember, health workers will be prioritized, then the indigents. As long as the prioritization is on five or six sectors, that’s okay. But I’ve said, my suggestion is they should already be named),” she said.\n",
      "“Halimbawa, health workers, dapat alam na natin, ilan ba sila? Ilan ba sila, sino sila, para kapag dumating, mayroong nang recipient, hindi gagawin natin iyong listahan kapag nandiyan na iyong vaccine (For example, for health workers, we should know how many they are, who they are, so that when the vaccine comes, we already have a list of recipients, not only when the vaccine is already available),” she added.According to President Duterte, the beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) and those who received the government’s cash aid during the pandemic will be on top of the priority list for the COVID-19 vaccination. Joining them are the country’s uniformed personnel.\n",
      "The vice president underscored the importance of preparing early for the vaccine distribution to prevent a repeat of the lapses in the implementation of the social amelioration program.\n",
      "“Sana, habang naghihintay tayo, halimbawa dumating siya 2nd quarter of 2021, ngayon pa lang, ready na iyong listahan (I hope while we are waiting, for example if it arrives in the 2nd quarter of 2021, the list is already ready as early as now),” she said.\n",
      "Robredo also pressed the need for the government to prepare the budget for proper vaccine storage given that these vaccines need to be kept in colder facilities than others.“Iyong nakabudget sa (2021) GAA (General Appropriations Act) for vaccines lang talaga, pero iyong for logistics, storage, hindi pa doon kasali. So ang suggestion ko, bakit hindi na natin i-request na magkaroon ng budget for that (The budget for 2021 is only for vaccines but the logistics, storage, are not included, so my suggestion is that why don’t we request a budget for that?),” she said.

      "Senator Imelda “Imee” Marcos on Sunday, Nov. 22, said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should use its clout to prod world leaders to come up with a global price ceiling for COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Senator Imee R. Marcos\n",
      "(IMEE MARCOS FACEBOOK / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Marcos, chair of the Senate committee on economic affairs, said less developed countries remain at the mercy of global pharmaceutical firms that hold patents and dictate the prices of vaccines.\n",
      "Therefore, she said, it is imperative that world leaders must agree to put a cap on the price of COVID-19, even a waiver on patents for vaccines, to ensure that less developed nations can gain access to immunization against COVID.The senator said the ASEAN, of which the Philippines is part of, should use its influence to start a new way of doing business in the manufacture, patenting, pricing and distribution of vaccines for COVID-19 and future pandemics.\n",
      "She noted that the 10-member ASEAN gained more influence as a trade bloc after signing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement last week with five other non-member states including Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea.\n",
      "The ASEAN can initiate a “new normal” for patents and copyrights, a world order of fairness, compassion and commitment to the common good, according to the lawmaker.\n",
      "“The RCEP represents about a third of the world’s population and global [gross domestic product]. We need a global accord on COVID-19 vaccines, a standard ceiling on vaccine prices, diversified manufacturing, and supply in all world regions,” Marcos said in a statement.She also said the ASEAN must hold the group comprising the European Union (EU) and 19 member states to its official statement in March to “spare no effort, both individually and collectively, to protect lives and safeguard people’s jobs and incomes.”\n",
      "Marcos also said a World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement—Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)—can be invoked to moderate vaccine patents during a global public health emergency.\n",
      "“Pharmaceutical firms must not forget the priceless role of human participation in vaccine trials. No vaccine could be created without it, so it’s about time they give back to the people of the world,” she stressed.Five pharmaceutical firms are now racing to complete the four-phase trials for COVID-19 vaccine. American firm Pfizer is leading the pack. Others include US firm Moderna, UK-based Oxford/Astra-Zeneca, China’s Sinovac Biotech, and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute.\n",
      "“Pfizer already made a killing on Viagra. Let’s hope the race to come up with a vaccine is guided mainly by the concern to save as many lives rather than to make as much profit as possible,” she said.\n",
      "The COVID-19 Vaccine Cluster, headed by Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr. earlier said the country’s COVID-19 vaccination could begin by May 2021, barring any unforeseen issues.\n",
      "According to Galvez, the government is targeting to procure an initial 24 million vaccines as President Duterte has expressed his desire to make COVID-19 vaccines accessible to the poor.\n",
      "The Senate, according to Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri, is also pouring more funds for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines under the proposed P4.506-trillion national budget.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Quezon City 2nd District Rep. Precious Hipolito Castelo has urged the government to start preparing cold storage facilities for storing and safekeeping of COVID-19 vaccines in anticipation of their arrival and mass distribution to the Filipino people.\n",
      "(PIXABAY / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The House Assistant Majority Leader filed House Bill No. 8000 or the proposed “Vaccine-Ready Philippines Act of 2020” urging the government to amply prepare cold storage facilities for the vaccines.“This pandemic has taught us many things, one of which is the importance of preparation. While this pandemic is something that caught many countries and governments off guard, this is not sufficient excuse not to prepare,” she said in her bill’s explanatory note.She said the Food and Drug Administration had noted that there is a specific temperature that should be maintained in order for a vaccine not to lose its efficacy.“Countries around the world, such as India, the second most populous nation, have been preparing to ramp up its cold chain facilities for effective delivery of the vaccines when they become available,” Castelo said.“It is thus the intent of this bill to provide sufficient and appropriate cold storage equipment for storage and safekeeping of the much-anticipated COVID-19 vaccines prior to their arrival in the country. Considering that the Philippines is also a relatively populous nation, a safe and effective mass distribution of the vaccines require ample planning and preparation.”HB No. 8000 tasks the Department of Health (DOH) to determine the specifications of the cold storage facility necessary for the anticipated COVID-19 vaccines.“DOH shall urgently prepare for the provision of cold storage facilities in accordance with the specifications that are suitable for safekeeping of the anticipated COVID-19 vaccines,” the measure provides.Castelo’s bill provides that the DOH, in coordination with theInter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), shall promulgate the necessary rules and regulations to effectively implement the provisions of the proposed Act within 30 days from its effectivity.

      "Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement after a recent Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey showed that 66 percent of Filipinos are willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine if it was available now.\n",
      "Thenational mobile phone survey was conducted from Sept. 17 to 20 and covered 1,249 adult Filipinos across the country.In a statement, Roque said that the Palace was pleased with the result of the survey because it shows that many people trust the government.\n",
      "“We are pleased with the results of the SWS National Mobile Phone Survey showing 66 percent of adult Filipinos are willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine,” he said.\n",
      "“We view this as a positive development as this means that more Filipinos trust the current government’s vaccination program,” he added.\n",
      "However, Roque said the Palace is hoping that the rest of the country would change their mind and opt to get the vaccine against COVID-19.\n",
      "“We, however, hope there will be a significant increase in the number of Filipinos willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine as President Duterte wants all Filipinos to get vaccines, with priority given to the poor, indigents and other vulnerable sectors,” he said.Based on the SWS survey, 32 percent of Filipinos said they will definitely get the vaccine while 34 percent said they would probably get it.\n",
      "Meanwhile, 31 percent are not willing to get the vaccine; 14 percent of which said they would probably not get it, and 17 percent remain unsure.\n",

      "American drugmaker Pfizer, in partnership with Germany’s BioNTech¸ announced on November 9 that tests showed that its vaccine was more than 90 percent effective in tests involving 43,000 volunteers. Pfizer CEO Albert Bouria said this may be the greatest medical advance in the last 100 years.\n",
      "A week later, on November 16, Moderna, Inc., a biotechnology firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced that its vaccine was 94.5 percent effective in protecting people from infection. “These are obviously very exciting results,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. “94.5 percent is truly outstanding.”Both companies announced their findings in press releases, not in peer-reviewed journals with detailed data that outside experts could evaluate. Moderna already has a $1,5-billion contract with the US government to provide the US with 100 million doses of its vaccine under President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed.\n",
      "In Geneva, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Athanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the news about the two vaccines. But the WHO right now is extremely concerned about the surge in cases, especially in Europe and the US, he said.\n",
      "WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminahan said the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines appear to have high efficacy, “but there are many, many questions still remaining about the duration of protection, the impact on several diseases, the impact on different subpopulations, especially the elderly, as well as adverse events beyond a certain period of time.” Clinical trials must continue, she said, and “we are looking at least the first half of the year as being a period with very limited doses.”\n",
      "In other words, there is yet no reason to believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is over and the world’s billions of people can now feel safe from getting infected because of the very positive results vaccine tests.\n",
      "Tests continue for at least 42 candidate vaccines identified by the WHO. It is thus best for people to maintain at best as it can the precautionary moves that can help stop the spread of the virus.These include the wearing of face masks and face shields, maintaining one’s distance from another person, avoiding mass gatherings, avoiding touching possible carriers of infection such as door knobs and light switches, and frequent hand-washing.\n",
      "We may have to keep taking these precautionary measures until at least the middle of next year, we hope we will have the vaccines ready and in quantities enough for the world’s billions of people. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "This developed as the House Committee on Peoples Participation chaired by San Jose del Monte Rep. Florida Robes lauded government movesin addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that such efforts have been commended by other countries.Dr. Aleli Annie Grace Sudiacal, representing the Department of Health’s Bureau of International Health Cooperation, disclosed that President Duterte has already approved the use of P2.5 billion in order to vaccinate some 22 million Filipinos for COVID-19 should one be made available.Appearing during the recent virtual committee meeting of the people participation panel, Sudiacal said that the President has already given his approval to use the P2.5 billion allotted for the purchase of COVID-19 under the proposed 2021 General Appropriations Act through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility.The House panel has been conducting meetings in a bid to coordinate and facilitate efforts in the development of vaccine for COVID-19.Sudiacal explained that COVAX facility, organized by the World Health Organization,is a global sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of vaccines once they are licensed and approved. It is expected to provide vaccination for 3 to 20 percent of the population or 3.2 million to 22 million Filipinos.According to her the COVAX facility pools together the world’s philanthropists, international non-governmental organizations and other groups to be able to talk to manufacturers to produce vaccines based on the need of a country, regardless of their economic standing. “This way we will be assured that manufacturers will produce the amount needed to vaccinate this eligible population,” she said.She added that the Philippines is eligible under the COVAX system because it is a low middle income country which signified its intention to be part of the system. However, the country needs to pay US$1.6 to US$2 per dose to be able to be take part in it.“As you all know we have RA 9184 or the Procurement Act which prohibits advance payment for something that is still not there. That is why we had to seek the intervention of the President and it’s very good news that the President has approved the use of the P2.5 billion allotted for the purchase of vaccines for the Philippines to have access to the COVAX facility,” she told the committee.With the President’s approval, the country may get access for around 20 percent of the population once a vaccine or several vaccines become available. She said funding will come from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.In the same hearing, Department of Science and Technology Assistant Secretary Leah Buendia said her department is currently studying the application of three vaccines for phase 3 of clinical trials, namely Sinovac from China, Sputnik V from Russia, and Johnson and Johnson from the United States.Buendia clarified that the Philippines has yet to evaluate the vaccine developed by Pfizer because the company has not submitted its application to the department.Robes for her part expressed elation over the latest vaccine development saying that it gives hope to the Filipino people who have long been hoping and praying for a vaccine for COVID-19.\n",
      "“We would like to commend the tireless efforts of the President and the IATF to help our countrymen and find a vaccine. We are almost there I think. With these new developments, we will be able to go back to normal very soon,” Robes said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "China has been giving experimental Covid-19 vaccines to people including state employees, international students and essential workersheading abroad since July.\n",
      "Sinopharm’s chairman told media this week that nearly a million peoplehave now received their vaccine for emergency use, though he did not provide a specific figure.“We have not received a single report of severe adverse reaction, and only a few had some mild symptoms,” Liu Jingzhen said in an interview re-published by the state-owned firm on Wednesday.\n",

      "Sinopharm is testing two vaccines in late-stage trials in countries including the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina.The company claimed this week to be “leading the world in all aspects” of vaccine development, although it did not offer clinical evidence from ongoing trials.\n",
      "Instead it cited anecdotal experiences from those who have been inoculated, including “construction personnel, diplomats, and overseas students” who it said have gone on to visit more than 150 countries after vaccination without being infected.\n",

      "Recto said the P18-billion proposed allocation being pushed in Senate for next year’s budget could cover only 1 in 5 Filipinos, or 20 percent of the population, even if the government purchases the cheapest vaccine available in the market.\n",
      "During the Senate’s plenary debates on the Department of Health’s (DOH) proposed 2020 budget Wednesday, Senator Pia Cayetano noted that World Health Organization recommended a herd immunity of 60 percent to finally break the transmission of the disease.Cayetano said that based on the costing of the DOH, the cheapest vaccine, the one developed by AztraZeneca, will cost about P610 per person and the most expensive is the one from Chinese Sinopharm, at around P17,690 per person for two doses.\n",
      "The AstraZeneca vaccine would cost the government some P15 billion to cover 24 million, or 20 percent of the population, she said.\n",
      "Further, the two senators observed that there was no budget for the expenses on the storage, distribution and inoculation of the vaccine.\n",
      "Cayetano said the government would need P7 billion more to cover expenses for supply chain and protective equipment for health workers, as well as post vaccination-surveillance, among others.In the initial budget proposal of the Senate, P10 billion of the P18-billion vaccine fund are placed under the unprogrammed appropriations, or those that are available when government revenue collection exceed targets or when additional grants or foreign funds are generated.\n",
      "Recto proposed to appropriate as unprogrammed funds at least P20 billion and another P20 billion for the delivery of the vaccines.\n",
      "“The cost of this pandemic to our economy this year will roughly be P1.9 trillion, the contraction of the economy. The lost opportunity is roughly another P1.9 trillion and here we are haggling with what? P50 billion?” he said.\n",
      "“The distribution probably will be more expensive than the vaccine itself,” he said.\n",
      "Cayetano shared Recto’ s view, calling on her colleagues support for more allocation for the vaccines.\n",
      "Recto said on Thursday that he is optimistic that the government will be able to address the possible challenges that the COVID-19 immunization would pose. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "President Duterte has allowed the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines in the country, the same practice that is being observed in China and soon in the United States, two countries that are already in the advanced stage of developing the vaccine against the highly contagious respiratory illness.\n",
      "President Rodrigo Roa Duterte\n",
      "(RICHARD MADELO / PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the announcement following reports that the vaccine being developed by Pfizer is 95 percent effective against COVID-19.\n",
      "Pfizer vaccinePfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday a completed analysis of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine found it protected 95 percent of people against the disease and announced they were applying for US emergency approval “within days.”\n",
      "The news from the US pharmaceutical company and its German partner brought further hope to a world upended by the coronavirus pandemic, and follows an announcement last week in which they said a preliminary analysis showed the product was 90 percent effective.\n",
      "Adding to the encouraging data was that the efficacy was found to be consistent across all age-groups – a primary concern for a disease that hits the elderly the hardest – as well as genders and ethnicities.\n",
      "“The study results mark an important step in this historic eight-month journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end this devastating pandemic,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.\n",
      "Moderna vaccine\n",
      "On Monday, US biotech firm Moderna said the two-dose vaccine it developed with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) was 94.5 percent effective, according to a preliminary analysis.\n",
      "Both vaccines use mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology to deliver genetic material to the body that makes human cells create a protein from the virus. This trains the immune system to be ready to attack if it encounters SARS-CoV-2.\n",
      "“These achievements highlight the potential of mRNA as a new drug class,” BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said.There are important differences between the two vaccines. Pfizer’s needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (- 94 degrees Fahrenheit) while Moderna’s only needs -20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit), more akin to a regular freezer.\n",
      "Duterte EO out soon\n",
      "In his Thursday presser, Roque said that President Duterte will soon issue an executive order (EO), through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that will authorize the emergency use of vaccines as long as these were already approved by the FDA in their respective countries of origin.\n",
      "“Hindi pa po naglalabas ni Presidente ang Executive Order (The President has not issued the EO yet),” he said.\n",
      "“‘Pag nilabas na po ‘yan ni Presidente mapapabilis po yung proseso ng paggamit ng mga bakuna na meron na ring authorization sa mga FDAs ng mga bansa kung saan na-develop ang mga vaccine (When the EO comes out, the process before one can get the vaccine will be faster as long as these vaccines are already approved by their respective FDAs),” he added.\n",
      "According to Roque, with the EO, it will take only 21 days before a person can get the vaccine.“Kung mapipirmahan po itong Executive Order na ito, 21 araw na lang po magagamit na rin natin sa Pilipinas (Once the EO is signed, we’ll only have to wait for 21 days before the vaccine can be used here in the Philippines),” he said.\n",
      "“Dati-rati po, bago magamit ang isang bakuna dito na approved na ng US o Chinese FDA, kinakailangan muna ng anim na buwan ng pagsusuri (Back then, before we can use a vaccine that is already approved by the US or Chinese FDA, we need to wait for six months of testing),” he added.\n",
      "In the same press briefing, Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said that the country is looking at 17 possible vaccines to bring into the country.\n",
      "“Marami na tayong kinakausap na vaccine companies at saka maganda ang ating (We’ve been talking to many vaccine companies and we have good) relationship with different countries,” he said.\n",
      "“Iyong companies na sponsored nila ay may naka-allocate na quota sa atin (The companies that these countries have sponsored have allocated a quota for us),” he added.\n",
      "However, Galvez said that they are recommending that there should still be a clinical trial of the said vaccines in the Philippines.\n",
      "Modes of procurement\n",
      "Meanwhile, Roque enumerated the different methods of how the Philippines can procure COVID-19 vaccines. He said one is direct procurement through the Government Procurement Reform Act or the Bayanihan To Recover As One Act.\n",
      "He said the country can also enter into multilateral loans like the Asian Development Bank-World Bank Project Loan for Vaccine. Another way is through bilateral loans.\n",
      "Roque likewise hailed the private sector for committing to pay for 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine where 50-80 percent will go to the government and the rest will be given to their employees.\n",
      "Arriving soon\n",
      "According to Galvez, the country can get hold of Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine called Sputnik V by the first quarter of 2021.\n",
      "He said that the government is targeting to vaccinate 25 million Filipinos next year and this is possible because the Philippines has good diplomatic relationships with both China and the US which is giving the country “a lot of allocations.”\n",
      "Galvez added that the government is targeting to get 30 million to 50 million doses from the said firms that they are in contact with.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Roque reminded the public that while COVID-19 vaccines are arriving in the country soon, they should still follow quarantine and health protocols to avoid catching the disease.\n",
      "“So konting tulog na lang mga kaibigan, mga kababayan. Pero habang wala pang bakuna, mask, hugas, iwas (We don’t have to wait that long. But while we’re waiting, wear your mask, wash your hands, and practice physical distancing),” he said.\n",

      "“Basta meron naman tayong pondo, kung kinakailangan ibenta ang mga ari-arian ng gobyerno, gagawin niya ‘yan (As long as we have the funds. If we have to sell government assets, then so be it),” Roque said.\n",

      "Last September, President Duterte said he will not spend a single peso to pay a “reservation fee” to pharmaceutical companies that have yet to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, saying it is against the country’s procurement laws. President Duterte said such companies are not welcome in the Philippines because they are just looking for someone who will finance their research and development activities.\n",

      "Senator Pia Cayetano on Wednesday stressed the need for Congress to appropriate sufficient funding for the health sector so the government can procure COVID-19 vaccines, sustain the cold chain, buy syringes and other equipment as soon as the vaccines for the coronavirus is already available in the market.\n",
      "Sen. Pia Cayetano\n",
      "Cayetano, vice chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and who is tasked to defend the Department of Health (DOH) and its attached agencies’ proposed budget for 2021, said it is imperative that the DOH is able to cover the identified priority groups of around 24 million vulnerable Filipinos which make up around 20 percent of the country’s population.Since the Philippines is now part of the COVAX facility, Cayetano said the government has the assurance of getting vaccines for three to 20 percent of the population.“So how much do we have to allocate to cover these priority groups? Based on the costing of DOH, we need to allocate at least P15-billion, if we purchase Aztrazeneca vaccine, which is the cheapest at around P610 per person,” Cayetano said during the Senate plenary debates on the proposed P4.506-trillion national budget for 2021.She said the government also has another option of buying vaccine from Sinopharm, which is the highest priced at around P17,690 per person for two doses. The government has to allocate P436.3-billion for China’s Sinopharm vaccines. Prices of other potential COVID-19 vaccines fall in between.“Experts recommend that we purchase from various suppliers. Why? Well, given that there may be possible side effects, we would rather spread out our risk throughout the population and minimize the chances that we are all exposed to one particular vaccine and any particular side effects they have,” she said.“It cannot be overemphasized that these amounts only cover the cost of vaccines and do not include consumables and other logistics that go into delivering the vaccine to the individual that needs it,” the senator stressed.Besides the acquisition of COVID-19 vaccines, the government has to consider other expenses particularly the cold/supply chain to ensure that the vaccines are in tightly controlled temperatures before it is administered to a person.She also said the government has to fund the training and personal protective equipment (PPEs) for the vaccinators, needles, syringes and other critical equipment.“These are things that have to be purchased in advance, considering that the entire world is also trying to get hold of them during this global crisis,” she pointed out.Considering that the DOH may not be also equipped to handle the supply chain requirements for COVID-19 vaccines, she said the government should be outsourcing, discussing, negotiating with private companies that are already equipped to handle such vaccines.“Wala hong masama na magtulong-tulong tayo. Whole-of-society, whole-of-nation dapat ang approach natin,” Cayetano said.According to Cayetano, the DOH and its attached agencies, including the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) has a proposed budget of P212.7-billion for next year.The Senate minority bloc earlier urged other members of the Upper Chamber to realign some funds lodged in the government’s anti-insurgency program to fund the government’s COVID-19 efforts.

      "In a briefing given to the House Committee on People’s Participation by government agencies involved in the COVID-19 vaccination, DOH representative, Dr. Aleli Annie Grace Sudiacal, made it clear that the prioritization of sectors lining up for vaccine protection will only be carried out based on the availability of supply.\n",
      "“We hope people will not misconstrue that they are not priority,” Sudiacal, director of the Bureau of International Health Cooperation, stressed.\n",
      "San Jose del Monte Rep. Rida Robes, chairperson of the people’s participation panel, said the prioritization list is clearly based on close analysis of the COVID-19 situation, adding that vaccine czar and national task force on COVID -19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez is for swiftly addressing the prioritization issue.“IATF’s handling of the anti-pandemic program has also been cited by other countries as successful.We found solutions to the worst problems faced by the country,” Robes said.\n",
      "The priority eligible groups as presented by Sudiacal:First priority:Frontline health workers numbering about 1,762,994 from both public and private sector;Second priority: Indigent senior citizens estimated at around 3,789,874 in numberThird priority; Remaining 5,678,544 senior citizensFourth Priority – Remaining indigent population estimated at 12,911,193Fifth priority – Uniformed personnel, 525,5236th Priority – Teachers and school workers in both private and public institutions7th Priority – All government workers from national agencies and local government units8th Priority – Essential workers in agriculture, food industry, transportation, and tourism9th Priority –Sociodemographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigent populations such as persons deprived of liberty; persons with disabilities, and Filipinos living in high density areas;10th Priority – Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs)11th Priority – Other remaining work force12th Priority – Students\n",
      "Sudiacal said that a prioritization list has become imperative because “we do not know yet the kind of vaccine to be approved and when it will come out.”She noted countries grappling with the dangers of the COVID-19 pandemic are also lining up to access the first available vaccine that will be manufactured.\n",
      "“We really have to prioritize based on the available supply,” the DOH official explained.Nevertheless, Sudiacal assured lawmakers that the Philippines has a good “fighting chance” of accessing the first available and effective anti-COVID 19 vaccine thru the COVAX facility of the World Health Organization.\n",

      "The Department of Health (DOH) reiterated its assurance that all potential COVID-19 vaccines —- that will enter the Philippines — will undergo a strict regulatory process to ensure its efficacy and safety.\n",
      "(PIXABAY / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“As I’ve said, all of the vaccines that will come into the country should be able to undertake itong regulatory process na meron tayo dito [this regulatory process that we have here],” said DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in an online forum Wednesday.Vergeire asked the public to trust the government’s process when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“The population or our Filipino public should just trust na ang proseso ng gobyerno ay sisiguraduhin na ligtasat saka magiging epektibo ang mga bakunang papapasukin natin dito sa ating bansa [The population or our Filipino public should just trust that the government’s process will ensure that the vaccines we will bring into our country are safe and effective],” she added.Update on potential independent clinical trials\n",
      "The Health official said that the American Biotech company Moderna is not keen in conducting a clinical trial in the Philippines for its COVID-19 candidate vaccine.“Ang Moderna, nakausap na sila ng Department of Science and Technology about a month ago and ang kanilang intent is not to have a clinical trial in the Philippines but they would want na doon na sila papasok sa vaccine procurement [Moderna already talked to the Department of Science and Technology about a month ago and their intent is not to have a clinical trial in the Philippines but they would want to enter (a negotiations) for vaccine procurement],” said Vergeire.Vergeire said that they would have wanted for the American firm to conduct clinical trials in the Philippines to test the efficacy of their candidate vaccine.“Ang objective ng Pilipinas ay magkaroon ng clinical trials dito ang mga manufacturers so that we can see the effect of these vaccines among our population kasi sabi nga natin iba-iba ang epekto ng bakuna sa bawa’t race, so mas maganda makikita natin [The objective of the Philippines is for manufacturers to have clinical trials here so that we can see the effects of these vaccines among our population because it can have different effects to every race. It would be ideal if we can see its effects in our population],” she said.Not having conductedclinical trials here, Vergeire said, would not prevent the Philippines from procuring proven and approved vaccines from their manufacturers.“If the manufacturer will not conduct a clinical trial here in the country, hindi po iyan makakaapekto sa pagpili natin. Although of course, that is the ideal…but if they do not intend, hindi po naman iyan makakapag stop sa gobyerno para mag procure tayo as long as they would go through the regulatory process [If the manufacturer will not conduct a clinical trial here in the country, that will not affect our selection process. Although of course, that is the ideal… but if they do not intend, that will not stop the government in procuring as long as they would go through the regulatory process],” she said.\n",
      "Moderna recently announced that its candidate vaccine posted 94.5 percent efficacy based on the preliminary results of their clinical trials.Meanwhile, the application ofChina’s Sinovac Biotech for holding clinical trials in the Philippines is still being reviewed by the health authorities, said Vergeire.“They are just completing some documentary requirements for our Ethics Review Board while the Food and Drug Administration is already conducting an initial evaluation,” said Vergeire.Sinovac already passed the evaluation of the vaccine experts panel of the Department of Science and Technology.Indian vaccine maker\n",
      "Serum Institute of India (SII) has committed to make its COVID-19 candidate vaccine available to the Philippines once it is already developed.\n",
      "Faberco Life Sciences Inc,a local pharmaceutical distributor, said it was authorized by SII to “represent it in the Philippines for the supply of the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Novovax.”\n",
      "“The President himself has expressed doubts if the Philippines will get vaccines being developed in the West. If and when the vaccine becomes available, SII and Faberco hope to bring a pleasant surprise,” Faberco Life Sciences medical director Dr. Luningning Villa said in a statement.The vaccine being developed by SII and Novovax is set to start the phase three trials in the United States this month.“SII has become a supplier of choice for those looking for high quality vaccines and India has a good track record and enjoys a high level of trust,” said Villa.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Health Secretary Francisco Duque III has proposed the emergency use of coronavirus vaccines once they arrive in the country to hasten the processing of their regulatory approval.\n",
      "President Rodrigo Roa Duterte presides over a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) core members prior to his talk to the people at the Malacañang Golf (Malago) Clubhouse in Malacañang Park, Manila on November 17, 2020. (ALFRED FRIAS/ PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "In a meeting on the government’s pandemic response Tuesday night, Duque asked President Duterte to allow the Food And Drug Administration (FDA) to issue the emergency use authorization (EUA) for vaccines, medicines, and technologies to fight the spread of the new coronavirus disease.\n",
      "EUAs are applied to justify the use of certain medical products during a public health emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent life-threatening disease or condition.“We are respectfully requesting that you consider the issuance of an executive order for FDA to grant an Emergency Use Authorization for the various vaccines that will enter the country and for which applications are to be filed,” Duque said in a report to the President.\n",
      "“Para mabilis po ito, it will cut the processing time from six months to about 21 days, Mr. President. So it will cut the red tape and, again, that is for your consideration,” he added.\n",
      "Duque said the EUA will facilitate the approval of medical products and technologies during the pandemic through the process of “reliance and recognition.”\n",
      "He said reliance refers to the FDA’s trust in the evaluation made by other national regulatory authorities abroad in deciding on a medical product’s application in the country. Recognition, on the other hand, is FDA’s routine acceptance of the regulatory decision of the other regulatory authorities or trusted institutions.Duque explained that EUA is used when there is a medical health emergency, a serious or life-threatening disease, proof that the product may be effective to prevent, diagnose, or treat a disease, positive risk/benefit balance, and when there is no adequate or approved alternative available.\n",
      "“Ang FDA ay mariin na magsasagawa po ng post-marketing surveillance activities at ang EUA maaaring i-revise or i-revoke ng FDA kung kinakailangan upang maprotektahan ang kalusugan (The FDA will conduct post-marketing surveillance activities and may revise or revoke the EUA if needed to protect public health),” he said.\n",
      "In the same meeting with the President, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. backed Duque’s proposal for the issuance of the emergency use of coronavirus vaccines in the country.Galvez, chief implementer of the government’s action plan to combat the pandemic, said the country could be assured of 30 million to 50 million doses by next year. “Pagka nag-roll out po ang ibang bansa (Once other countries roll out the vaccines), we can also have our rollout here,” he told the President.\n",
      "He said the country has 17 possible sources of coronavirus vaccines abroad. Of the 17 potential vaccines, Galvez said nine products are undergoing phase three clinical trials. On the last stage of clinical studies, three potential vaccines will undergo trials in the country this December and January.\n",
      "Galvez also recommended that the government should take the “advance market commitment” by the end of the year through the multilateral arrangement with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank as finance managers.\n",
      "“At the same time, we also have to have various modes of financing including Private-Public Tripartite Agreement without the cost with the government,” he said.\n",
      "Galvez said the private sector also intends to buy supplies directly from the vaccine company but subject to the regulation of the health department. “The DOH will be the one who will know, who will decide where the vaccine will be given,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Senate leaders aired on Tuesday their reservations on the Philippine International Trading Corporation’s (PITC) ability to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for the country once supplies are available.\n",
      "Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said the Department of Trade and Industry-attached corporation might not be able to deliver on time the vaccines that the government would ask it to procure.\n",
      "During the chamber’s plenary debates on the proposed budget of the Department of Interior and Local Government and its attached agencies, he cited the delays in the PITC’s procurements on behalf of government agencies like the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, among others, whose funds for such purchases were made available since 2016.“In fact, their (PITC) track record doesn’t seem to be good. As I have pointed out, dito sa (here in the) PNP, it took them four years, and then ngayon, pangakong ide-deliver. Eh paano na ‘pag vaccine ‘yan, baka apat na taon hindi pa rin dumating (What if these are vaccines, it might take four years and still not arrive)?” Recto said.\n",
      "Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara giggled at Recto’s comparison, saying: “Obsolete na ‘yong vaccine (The vaccines will be obsolete)…by that time.”\n",
      "“Wala kang inoculate, namatay na lahat (You failed to inoculate, everyone already died of COVID-19),” Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon followed.\n",
      "President Duterte had tasked the PITC to facilitate the purchase COVID-19 vaccines from abroad. Under his initial plan, the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines will provide a P20-billion loan to PITC, which will then sell the vaccines to the Department of Health for distribution to poor beneficiaries.Lawmakers, on the other hand, set aside P8 billion for vaccine purchase in the 2021 General Appropriations Bill, and another P10 billion in unprogrammed funds to be released once government resources are available.Drilon supported Recto’s earlier proposal that the PITC waive its four-percent commission not only for procuring the vaccines, but also for other projects that its services were tapped.\n",
      "“I don’t want to think that it is this commission which influences the various government offices from availing of the services of PITC…That is why we are supporting, and probably if we can move that part of the special provisions is a provision which will prohibit the payment of commission to PITC, not only in COVID[-19] but in all other cases, as Senator Recto said,” he said.\n",
      "The senators said the fondness of agencies to outsource their procurements through the PITC should be stopped.Recto, who called the practice as “pasa-buy”, said this also gives Congress a false sense of security that the agencies have already disbursed and obligated the funds that were appropriated to them, and in turn will shortchange the public since the needed government services were not delivered to them.\n",
      "“It is a way to make it appear that an agency has obligated its budget. And in truth and in fact, it is just another layer, and there has not been a significant process made in terms of procurement or actual disbursement of budget, your honor,” Angara agreed.\n",
      "“Yes, it’s a practice, it can be deceptive at times,” he continued. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "(Joe Raedle / Getty Images / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Presidential spokesman Harry Roque mentioned the country’s potential vaccine supply from the United States after another biotech company announced a breakthrough in vaccine development.\n",
      "“We have firm commitments from the United States, relayed to (Foreign Affairs) Secretary (Teodoro) Locsin (Jr.) by no less than (US State) Secretary (Mike) Pompeo, that we will have access to COVID vaccines that may be developed in the United States,” Roque said during a televised press conference.Roque has welcomed the announcement of Moderna, Inc. that its experimental vaccine against the coronavirus appeared highly effective, saying this was “good news.”\n",
      "The efficacy of the Moderna vaccine came a week after the promising results from Pfizer about its vaccine in reducing the risk of coronavirus infection. Both companies reportedly used the same technology to make their vaccines.“Punta muna po tayo sa ating mga balita, mabuting balita naman po ito: Inanunsiyo po ng Moderna na ang kanilang bakuna laban sa COVID-19 ay 94.5% effective base sa resulta ng kanilang clinical trial (Let’s to other news, this is good news: Moderna announced that their COVID-19 vaccine is 94.5 percent effected based on the results of their clinical trial),” Roque said.\n",
      "“Kung inyong matatandaan, noong isang linggo lamang, inanunsiyo naman ng Pfizer na ang kanilang vaccine ay more than 90% effective. Anong ibig sabihin nito? Well, palapit na palapit na po ang pagkakaroon ng bakuna laban sa COVID-19 (If you remember, just last week, Pfizer announced its vaccine is more than 90 percent effective. What does this mean? Well, our vaccine against COVID-19 is forthcoming),” he said.Pfizer earlier announced its potential vaccine was more than 90 percent effective in preventing the disease.\n",
      "Apart from the US commitment, Roque said the country has secured an assurance from China about a potential coronavirus vaccine supply. He said Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised President Duterte about supplying Chinese-made vaccines to the Philippines.\n",
      "Roque said the United Kingdom has also committed to the World Health Organization about giving access to vaccines to poor countries.Earlier, Russia has offered to supply coronavirus vaccines to the Philippines, which President Duterte has accepted.\n",
      "Pending the COVID-19 vaccine production, Roque appealed anew to the public to continue to observe health protocols such as wearing of mask, frequent washing of hands and observing safe distancing from others.\n",
      "Malacañang, meantime, is also thankful for the reported drop in thecoronavirus positivity rate in Metro Manila. He credited the public for cooperating with the government in curbng the spread of the disease.\n",
      "“We are now back to the acceptable range as set by the WHO (World Health Organization) na ang positivity rate should be less than 5 percent. At 4 percent, patunay po iyan na ang mga taga-Metro Manila ay nais po talagang pangalagaan ang kanilang kalusugan para sila po ay makapaghanapbuhay na (At 4 percent, it proves Metro Manila residents want to protect their health so they can get back to work),” he said.\n",

      "Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto on Tuesday called on the government not to abandon its contact tracing efforts while the country waits for a vaccine against COVID-19.\n",
      "(JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "No funds were allocated for the contact tracing program under the P4.506-trillion 2021 government spending plan, said Senator Juan Edgardo Angara during the plenary debates on the Department of Interior and Local Government’s (DILG) P244-billion proposed budget.\n",
      "“Unlike what we put in Bayanihan 2, there is no similar item [in the 2021 budget]. There is none, your honor, yes,” Angara told Recto.The DILG was given a P5-billion fund under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act to hire and train 50,000 contact tracers and augment the personnel employed by the government to track down close contacts of COVID-19 patients. It said it so far hired 46,338.\n",
      "For their 2021 budget, however, Angara said the DILG did not request for continued appropriation for the program.\n",
      "Speaking for DILG Secretary Eduardo Año who was in the Senate plenary, Angara said the agency does not intend to totally abandon it and will continue to supervise the contact tracing activities of the local government units (LGUs), the police, and the Bureau of Fire Protection.\n",
      "He also said that the DILG hopes that the additional contact tracers it hired under the Bayanihan 2 would be absorbed by LGUs so they can continue to do their work.\n",
      "But Recto doubted that LGUs will still have funds to pay for the services of the contact tracers, saying that they have already spent a significant amount for their constituents during the pandemic, and the calamities that hit their areas this year.\n",
      "“Let’s say, the province of Batangas, kasi tinamaan din ng Taal Volcano ‘yan (which was affected by eruption of the Taal Volcano), so their local government revenues next year will be less tha this year, including local revenues because of the pandemic. Babagsak ang revenues (Their revenues will decline) similar to the national government,” he pointed out.\n",
      "“Kung walang budget (If there is no budget) for contact tracing, it would appear to me that we are abandong it. Walang pondo rin ang LGU (LGUs also do not have the funds) for that,” Recto said.\n",
      "Recto further said: “My worry is that if we abandon [it] — because of the P4.5 trillion budget for next year, there is no amount of money for contact tracing — I don’t know if that’s wise if we abandon contact tracing immediately.”\n",
      "“Mabuti na ‘yong naninigurado tayo at marami namang walang trabaho ngayon, eh ‘di mabuti nagbibigay din naman tayo ng trabaho (It’s better that we are proactive and since many lost their jobs, it’s good that we are providing jobs for them). And with the mission of ensuring, habang wala pa ‘yong (while we are waiting for the) vaccine, that we continue what we are doing,” he added.\n",
      "Angara agreed with Recto’s view and said he would ask the DILG to submit an estimate on how many LGUs to absorb the 50,000 contact tracers hired under Bayanihan 2.\n",
      "There are over 257,000 contact tracers across the country to date, the DILG said in its update to senators. Around 55 percent of LGUs in the country were capacitated to conduct contact tracing.\n",

      "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) last night (Nov 16) released its guidance to ensure that the air cargo industry can support the large-scale handling, transport and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine.IATA’s Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution provides recommendations for governments and the logistics supply chain in preparation for what will be the largest and most complex global logistics operation ever undertaken. “Delivering billions of doses of a vaccine that must be transported and stored in a deep-frozen state to the entire world efficiently will involve hugely complex logistical challenges across the supply chain,” stressed IATA’s Director General and CEO, Alexandre de Juniac.\n",
      "“While the immediate challenge is the implementation of COVID-19 testing measures to re-open borders without quarantine, we must be prepared for when a vaccine is ready,” he added.‘This guidance material is an important part of those preparations.”Key challenges addressed in IATA’s Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution include the availability of temperature-controlled storage facilities and contingencies when such facilities are not availableThr roles and responsibilities of parties involved in the distribution of vaccines, particularly government authorities and NGOs, should also be defined.Industry preparedness for vaccine distribution includes capacity and connectivity: The global route network has been reduced dramatically from the pre-COVID 22,000 city pairs.Governments need to re-establish air connectivity to ensure adequate capacity is available for vaccine distribution.Facilities and infrastructure ste vital.\n",
      "The first vaccine manufacturer to apply for regulatory approval requires the vaccine to be shipped and stored in a deep-frozen state, making ultra-cold chain facilities across the supply chain essential.Some types of refrigerants are classified as a dangerous goods and volumes are regulated which adds an additional layer of complexity. Considerations include availability of temperature-controlled facilities and equipment and staff trained to handle time- and temperature-sensitive vaccines.Timely regulatory approvals and storage and clearance by customs and health authorities will be essential.Priorities for border processes include introducing fast-track procedures for overflight and landing permits for operations carrying the COVID-19 vaccine and potential tariff relief to facilitate the movement of the vaccine.Vaccines are highly valuable commodities. Arrangements must be in place to ensure that shipments remain secure from tampering and theft.Processes are in place already, but the huge volume of vaccine shipments will require early planning to ensure that they are scalable.Reflecting the complexity of the challenge, the Guidance was produced with the support of a broad range of partners, includingthe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA),International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) , UK Civil Aviation Authority, World Bank,World Customs Organization (WCO) andWorld Trade Organization (WTO).The guidance includes a repository of international standards and guidelines related to the transport of vaccines and will be updated regularly as information is made available to the industry.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“We continue to receive encouraging news about COVID-19 vaccines,” Tedros told a virtual press briefing.\n",
      "Tedros, who has just spent more than two weeks in quarantine after coming in contact with someone with COVID-19, said he was “cautiously optimistic” that new tools would start to arrive in the coming months.But he added: ”This is no time for complacency.”\n",
      "His comments came as hopes of trials of a second candidate vaccine suggested it was nearly 95 percent effective against the virus.\n",
      "“The idea that we have a 94.5 percent effective vaccine is stunningly impressive. It is really a spectacular result that I don’t think anybody had anticipated it would be this good,” said United States’ top infectious disease scientist Anthony Fauci on Monday.\n",
      "Fauci leads the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which began co-developing the vaccine with the US biotech company in January, shortly after China shared the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus.\n",
      "It is based on a relatively new technology that uses a synthetic version of a molecule called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine making factories.\n",
      "No vaccine based on this platform has ever been approved.\n",
      "‘The data speak for themselves’\n",
      "The news from US biotech firm Moderna follows a similarly impressive result from American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech last week, who reported an efficacy of 90 percent for their vaccine.\n",
      "Asked whether it was too early to say if mRNA technology had now been proven, Fauci – who is usually known for his cautious statements – said the jury was definitely in.\n",
      "“I think when you have two vaccines like this, that have proven to be greater than 90 percent effective, I think that mRNA is here, it’s established itself, it doesn’t need to prove anything anymore.\n",
      "“The data speak for themselves; it isn’t me, it isn’t my opinion – look at the data,” Fauci said.\n",
      "Traditional virus vaccines use actual viruses that have to be grown in chicken eggs or fetal cell lines and then weakened so they don’t harm people – a process that can take many months.\n",
      "By contrast, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines deliver the genetic information needed to create a protein that lies on the surface of the virus – called the spike protein – directly to cells in the human body, which then grow it.\n",
      "This primes the immune system to make antibodies to the actual virus, and has the major advantage of shortening vaccine development time to a matter of weeks, once scientists have the genetic sequence of the protein they want to create.\n",
      "‘Playing with fire’\n",
      "But WHO has warned that widespread availability of any vaccine remains a long way off, and COVID-19 cases and deaths are surging in many parts of the world.\n",
      "”Those countries that are letting the virus run unchecked are playing with fire,” Tedros said.\n",
      "He voiced particular alarm about the situation in Europe and the Americas, where he said health workers and systems were being pushed to breaking point.\n",
      "”A laissez-faire attitude to the virus … leads to death, suffering and hurts livelihoods and economies,” he said.\n",
      "”The quickest way to open up economies is to defeat the virus.”\n",
      "The UN agency’s headquarters is experiencing its own outbreak of coronavirus, with Tedros spending 17 days in quarantine – though he said he had not developed any symptoms.\n",
      "Five new cases within the same WHO team have been registered in the past week, WHO official Maria Van Kerkhove said.\n",
      "”We don’t know if there is an actual cluster,” she said, adding that experts were trying to work out if transmission had happened on the premises.\n",
      "WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan stressed that the Geneva region is experiencing ”some of the most intense transmission in the world right now”.\n",
      "”We are human beings and we live within a society,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "US biotech firm Moderna on Monday announced its experimental vaccine against Covid-19 was almost 95 percent effective, marking a second major breakthrough in the quest to end the pandemic.\n",
      "Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are based on a new technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories\n",
      "Moderna released early results from a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants, after American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech last week said their vaccine was 90 percent effective.Both frontrunners are based on new technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.“This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease, including severe disease,” said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel.\n",
      "“Today’s news of a second vaccine is further reason to feel hopeful,” tweeted President-elect Joe Biden, but he cautioned that its widespread distribution was months away.\n",
      "“Until then, Americans need to continue to practice social-distancing and mask-wearing to get the virus under control,” he said.\n",
      "Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval around the world within weeks, and says it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.\n",
      "The company, which has received $2 billion from the US government under “Operation Warp Speed,” added it is on track to manufacture between 500 million to a billion doses globally in 2021.\n",
      "Global infections from Covid-19 have soared past 54 million with more than 1.3 million deaths since the virus emerged in China late last year.\n",
      "President Donald Trump also weighed in on Twitter, to take credit. “Please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!”– Beginning of the end? –\n",
      "The Moderna vaccine, which was co-developed by the US National Institutes of Health, is given in two doses 28 days apart, and the preliminary results are based on the 95 of the 30,000 volunteers who fell ill with Covid-19.\n",
      "Of the 95, 90 had been in the trial’s placebo group, and five in the group that received the drug, called mRNA-1273, translating to an efficacy rate of 94.5 percent.\n",
      "There were 11 people who fell severely ill, all of whom were in the placebo group.\n",
      "A small fraction of people experienced severe symptoms such as fatigue, muscle and joint pains, or redness at the injection site, but these side-effects were short lasting.\n",
      "“The light at the end of the tunnel just got even brighter,” tweeted Atul Gawande, a member of Biden’s coronavirus advisory board and a surgeon at a Harvard-affiliated hospital.\n",
      "Crucially, Moderna also announced that its vaccine can remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 days.\n",
      "The company added it could be kept in long-term storage at standard freezer temperatures of -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) for up to six months.\n",
      "Pfizer’s vaccine, on the other hand, needs to be stored in deep-freezer conditions of -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) which could complicate supply chain logistics, particularly in less developed countries.\n",
      "On the downside, Moderna’s vaccine has about three times more genetic material per dose than its Pfizer counterpart, Zoltan Kis, a research associate at Imperial College’s Future Vaccine Manufacturing Hub, said.This would raise production costs and make it harder to scale-up.\n",
      "– Questions remain –\n",
      "The promising results of both vaccines are seen as a validation for mRNA technology, which has never before been brought to regulatory approval.\n",
      "It works by providing human cells with the genetic instructions to make a surface protein of the coronavirus, which trains the immune system to recognize the real virus.\n",
      "Making a traditional vaccine is a longer process that normally involves developing a weakened form of a pathogen.It is not yet clear how long lasting the protection will be from either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, nor how well they work for the elderly, the age-group at highest risk from Covid-19.\n",
      "Another open question is whether they stop people who are exposed to the virus from transmitting it on to the other people, even though they may be themselves protected from the disease. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "WASHINGTON (AFP) – The United States could be the first country to launch one of the most ambitious vaccine operations in history: distributing and administering up to 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine in just a few months.\n",
      "Massive vaccine campaigns are nothing new — they have been carried out for decades in the fight against the measles and flu, for example.\n",
      "But stamping out the coronavirus is a distinctly new challenge due to three factors: the short time frame for inoculating a huge number of people, the fact that most vaccines will require two doses, and the very low temperature at which some of the vaccines must be stored.The vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech, on track to be the first authorized for use in the United States, must be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit (-70 degrees Celsius), whereas the flu vaccine can be kept in a normal refrigerator.\n",
      "Pfizer vaccines distributed in the US will come from its largest manufacturing plant located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Their ship-out will include a precise, clockwork-like dance of containers, trucks and planes.\n",
      "Thermal shipping containers will each be filled with dry ice and 975 vials of the vaccine which each contain five doses, for a total of 4,875 doses.\n",
      "Every day six trucks will take the doses to air carriers such as FedEx, UPS or DHL, which will deliver them across the United States in one to two days and across the globe in three, Pfizer told AFP.The company expects an average of 20 daily cargo flights worldwide.\n",
      "FedEx had to obtain special permission from civil aviation authorities to transport so much dry ice, which could pose a danger to the crew should it accidentally undergo ”sublimation” and pass from a solid to a gas, the company told AFP.\n",
      "Once the boxes have reached their final destination, they can be opened only briefly just two times a day.”To run a large mass vaccination clinic, it’s fine,” said Julie Swann, a pandemic response expert at North Carolina State University.\n",
      "But the vaccine would not be suitable for distribution at doctors’ offices or pharmacies, which are too small, she warned.\n",
      "At least in the beginning Americans will have to go to hospitals or maybe even large distribution centers set up in parking lots much like Covid test sites, she said.\n",
      "The vaccines can remain in their boxes for two weeks meaning hospitals will not need a special freezer.\n",
      "”We’re not recommending at this time that hospitals or clinics purchase ultra cold equipment,” said Janell Routh of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "US biotech giant Moderna is also manufacturing a vaccine, which can be stored at -4 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a normal freezer.\n",
      "The US government is organizing a free distribution of this vaccine to US states and territories, with each jurisdiction to decide how to distribute the doses to hospitals, pharmacies, doctors or even universities and companies will distribute the doses, in a decentralized system much like what was used for the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009.\n",
      "”The federal government does not intend, with very, very few exceptions, to touch a single dose of vaccine before it goes into the arm of Americans,” said Paul Mango, an Operation Warp Speed official, during a briefing.\n",
      "The objective is to offer vaccines to the most vulnerable populations before the end of December, to healthcare workers before the end of January and all Americans by the beginning of April.\n",
      "Pfizer expects to produce 50 million doses this year and 1.3 billion in 2021: The United States has already ordered 100 million total including 20-30 million for delivery before the end of December. The European Union meanwhile has ordered 200 million, Japan 120 million, Britain 30 million and Canada 20 million.\n",
      "Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi and others are hoping their own vaccines will also prove safe and effective, and their global rollout will follow suit.\n",
      "Carrier DHL estimates that 15 million cooling boxes would need to be delivered over the next two years, with approximately 15,000 flights needed worldwide.\n",
      "Poorer countries that lack storage capacity for large quantities of vaccines that need super-cold storage have little hope of benefiting from the first doses, said Prashant Yadav, an expert in global health supply chains at the Center for Global Development.\n",
      "Ultracold freezers that can reach temperatures of -112 degrees Fahrenheit cost five times more than standard freezers and are only made to order, he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP)\n",
      "“A vaccine will be a vital tool for controlling the pandemic, and we’re encouraged by the preliminary results of clinical trials released this week,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, in closing the WHO’s annual assembly.\n",
      "US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their candidate vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in ongoing final phase trials involving more than 40,000 people, less than a year after the novel coronavirus emerged in China.“Never in history has vaccine research progressed so quickly. We must apply the same urgency and innovation to ensuring that all countries benefit from this scientific achievement,” said Tedros.\n",
      "The coronavirus has killed nearly 1.3 million people worldwide while more than 52.7 million cases have been registered, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.\n",
      "However, the tallies probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases.\n",
      "– Shared pathogens lab plan –\n",
      "Tedros said the pandemic had shown there was an urgent need for “a globally-agreed system for sharing pathogen materials and clinical samples”, to facilitate the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics as “global public goods”.He said the system could not wait for bilateral agreements that could take years to negotiate.\n",
      "“We are proposing a new approach that would include a repository for materials housed by WHO in a secure Swiss facility; an agreement that sharing materials into this repository is voluntary; that WHO can facilitate the transfer and use of the materials; and a set of criteria under which WHO would distribute them,” said Tedros.\n",
      "The UN health agency’s director-general thanked Thailand and Italy for offering to provide materials and pioneer the new approach, and Switzerland for offering a laboratory.WHO member states on Friday approved a resolution on strengthening preparedness for health emergencies.\n",
      "The resolution calls on countries “to prioritise at the highest political level the improvement of, and coordination for, health emergency preparedness.”\n",
      "It also urges countries to continue developing their capacities for detecting infectious diseases, in compliance with the International Health Regulations.\n",
      "– Sounding the alarm –\n",
      "The regulations on global health security, approved in 2005 and entering into force two years later, notably regulate how a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) is declared.\n",
      "They also include specific measures to be implemented at ports, airports and border posts in order to limit the spread of risk.\n",
      "Several voices were raised questioning the effectiveness of this process in attempting to prevent or rein in the Covid-19 pandemic.\n",
      "Washington accused Tedros of being too slow to declare a PHEIC over the new coronavirus. The WHO chief himself has been critical of its binary on-or-off nature, with no levels of alert in between.\n",
      "The resolution adopted on Friday asks Tedros to seek possible “complementary mechanisms” that could be used to alert member states “about the severity and/or magnitude of a public health emergency in order to mobilise necessary support and to facilitate international coordination”.\n",
      "He is expected to deliver his ideas at the next WHO annual meeting.\n",
      "Besides discussing the pandemic, the WHO assembly agreed on a new plan to defeat meningitis by 2030; increased action on epilepsy and other neurological disorders; and a strategy to speed up the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“When people can’t easily access reliable information around vaccines and when mistrust in actors and institutions related to vaccines is high, misinformation narratives rush in to fill the vacuum,” First Draft said in a report.\n",
      "“We have reached a pivotal and hypersensitive crossroads where increasing rates of vaccine skepticism may not only jeopardize the effectiveness of a potential Covid-19 vaccine but that of vaccines more broadly.”The group collected millions of posts from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook that included the words “vaccine” or “vaccination” in English, Spanish and French for three months from mid-June.\n",
      "Researchers then whittled those down to 1,200 of the most viral posts.\n",
      "Two topics were dominant — those that referred to the “political and economic motives” behind vaccines and those that referred to their safety and necessity.\n",
      "“Conspiracy theories about vaccines in general and the Covid-19 vaccine specifically play an outsized role on social media, particularly in Francophone spaces,” concluded the group, which was founded in 2015 and is considered an authority on misinformation.\n",
      "Many posts linked vaccines to conspiracy theories such as the belief that a future Covid-19 shot will be used to microchip individuals and develop mass population-tracking systems.\n",
      "Conspiracy theories were also fuelled by a lack of information about vaccine ingredients, for instance, or new technologies such as “messenger RNA” (mRNA) behind the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, which announced this week it was 90 percent effective.\n",
      "This innovative technique is being used by other vaccine developers such as US biotech company Moderna.\n",
      "“Certain posts claimed Moderna’s new potential Covid-19 vaccine will change people’s DNA, and some posts presented the mRNA vaccine as the definitive future Covid-19 vaccine or discredited any future Covid-19 vaccine altogether,” First Draft said.\n",
      "“Others even linked Moderna’s vaccine and mRNA vaccines generally to targeted depopulation efforts or malign human engineering programs.”\n",
      "The NGO noted that vaccine concerns brought together a wide range of different communities including libertarians, anti-vaxxers, New Age groups and QAnon adherents.\n",
      "It recommended reliable news sources, social media monitoring and research organisations collaborate to identify and address any lack of data, but also avoid oversupply of information on a given topic, which “often leads to confusion and ultimately news avoidance.”\n",
      "“We need to find a way to acknowledge people’s uncertainties and fears, rather than dismiss them, and build bridges between health experts and the vaccine-hesitant,” it added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The Social Weather Stations (SWS) said on Thursday night, Nov. 12, that its National Mobile Phone Survey conducted during Sept. 17 to 20 showed that “80% of adult Filipinos expect a vaccine against Covid-19 to be available in the next 12 months.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON, United States — The United States on Tuesday registered a record 200,000 new COVID-19 cases in one day, highlighting the desperate need for a vaccine after results from one medical trial fuelled optimism around the world.\n",
      "(Photo by Natalia KOLESNIKOVA / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The vaccine news brought some relief from an otherwise grim picture, with tighter restrictions imposed in Europe and the Middle East, and a surge in the US claiming 1,535 lives in 24 hours.\n",
      "Stocks in some industries hit hardest by travel curbs, social distancing and lockdowns rebounded on hopes that the world may return to normal, after pharma giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their vaccine candidate was 90 percent effective.A vaccine is seen as the best chance to break the cycle of deadly virus surges and severe restrictions across much of the world since COVID-19 first emerged in China late last year and ballooned into a pandemic.\n",
      "Pfizer and BioNTech said they could supply up to 50 million doses of the vaccine globally this year and up to 1.3 billion next year if it receives approval.\n",
      "The scientific community reacted positively overall — although the trial is still ongoing and the vaccine candidate would need to be stored in specialist deep freezers, creating huge supply chain complications.\n",
      "The vaccine candidate is one of more than 40, but no other developer has yet made similar claims about effectiveness.There was also promising news from Brussels, where the EU parliament and member states struck a deal to pass the bloc’s multi-annual budget, unblocking 750 billion euros ($886 billion) in coronavirus recovery funds.\n",

      "The US remains the hardest hit nation at more than 10 million cases and nearly 240,000 deaths, with shocking new data now including a record 60,000 current hospitalizations.\n",

      "Joe Biden, who had slammed President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis, spared no time in announcing a COVID-19 taskforce on Monday after being declared president-elect.\n",
      "“We’re still facing a very dark winter,” Biden said.Trump had clashed repeatedly with his own government experts, often refusing to back restrictions or even wear a mask in public.\n",
      "After the Pfizer announcement, he claimed — without evidence — that the news was delayed until after the election to damage him.\n",
      "There was a separate breakthrough when the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted emergency approval to a synthetic antibody treatment developed by the pharma company Eli Lilly.\n",
      "Bamlanivimab, which was shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and emergency room visits, is the first major drug to be approved that was designed specifically for the coronavirus.\n",

      "Offering a glimpse of hope amid the pandemic, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the designated vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19, expressed optimism Wednesday on the discovery and availability of a possible cure against the viral disease that has taken the world by surprise.\n",
      "Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.\n",
      "(NTF AGAINST COVID-19 / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "However, Galvez said that while the potential vaccine is just around the corner, Filipinos should still observe the minimum health standards to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n",
      "“Sa ngayon nakita natin malaki ang prospects natin na talagang magkakaroon na tayo ng vaccine pero sinasabi natin na habang wala pa ang vaccine ay patuloy pa rin natin na (sundin) ang minimum health standard, social distancing at pagwear ng mask, at pag-iwas sa matataong lugar (Right now, we have very high prospects that we will really have a vaccine but while it isn’t here yet, we should still [follow] the minum health standard, [observe] social distancing, wearing of mask, and avoiding crowded areas),” he said in a virtual media forum.Recently, Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical giant, announced that the vaccine that it is currently developing in partnership with BioNTech, a German biotechnology company, yielded more than 90 percent efficiency in preventing COVID-19 among its volunteers.\n",
      "But Galvez said that the government is currently prioritizing the candidate vaccines being offered in the Covax Facility, where a solidarity trial participated in by hundreds of countries and initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO) is currently happening.\n",
      "“Sa Covax mayroon na po tayong tinatawag na 20 percent guaranteed access. Meaning, more or less 25 to 20 million Filipinos can access equitably doon sa Covax,” he said.\n",
      "Galvez noted that bilateral and multilateral engagements with other countries are being done so that the Philippines’ access to the Covax Facility can be increased to enable the inoculation of 25 to 30 million Filipinos.Earlier, Galvez said that the “best case scenario” for the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines is that it could take place in the second quarter of 2021.\n",
      "Priority\n",
      "Meanwhile, Galvez turned to the directive of President Duterte back in September to prioritize the vaccines being developed by China and Russia.Department of Health spokesperson Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire has said that the country is already in “advanced talks” with China and Russia to secure a supply of the vaccines that they are developing, which are Sinovac and Gamaleya respectively.The vaccine czar met with the ambassador of China on Wednesday to discuss the development of its clinical trials in the Philippines for the Sinovac vaccine.\n",
      "“We are very thankful that they have committed na bibigyan tayo ng access. The prime minister of China has given an order that the Philippines will be given a priority access and they will even donate some of the vaccines for us,” he said.\n",
      "China is currently on the Phase 3 clinical trials of its candidate vaccine, Sinovac.But its development took a snag when a “serious adverse event” led to the stoppage of its clinical trials in Brazil, foreign news reports said Wednesday. No other information was immediately provided as to what kind of event took place.\n",
      "“Sa issue ng Brazil, tignan muna natin ang evdence na lumabas. Minsan ‘yung mga balita na lumalabas mga kontrobersyal, minsan para magpeak ‘yung isang brand or maging maganda ‘yung media releases ng ibang brands. Hintayin natin ang comment ng company so our evaluation will be evidence-based,” Galvez said.Brazil’s Butantan biomedical institute, however, was quoted as saying that the serious adverse event “was not related to the vaccine trial itself,” according to a report from CNN.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Gamaleya already submitted the results of their Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to the Department of Health (DOH).\n",
      "The government is now awaiting for Gamaleya’s contract research organization (CRO) which will serve as their partner team in the Philippines before they can conduct their Phase 3 clinical trial, or the vaccination of a large number of people who are conisdered as test subjects, here in the country.\n",
      "With the government’s target of getting vaccine shots for 75 to 80 million Filipinos, Galvez said the COVID-19 vaccination program may last up to three to five years.\n",
      "“Realistically, you can only vaccinate so much. Ang target natin is 75 to 80 million of our population, then we will do this in three to five years time. Iyon po ang reality,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "American drug-maker Pfizer and its partner BionNtech recently announced that the COVID-19 vaccine that they are jointly developing was 90 percent effective in preventing the disease as shown in the early results of the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.“Napaka-encouraging po itong lumabas na artikulo about Pfizer.

But of course, we have to temper our expectations.

More so, we are all encouraged because it looks like there are good indications in the vaccine trials that are being conducted),” she added.\n",
      "It is still too early to conclude if the candidate vaccine of Pfizer and BioNtech is effective against COVID-19, although it is considered as “exciting news,” said Dr. Anna Lisa Ong-Lim, a pediatric infectious specialist and a member of the DoH Technical Advisory group.\n",

      "Senate Ralph Recto (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“This is not the time to reap a pandemic windfall. When private corporations are waiving fees and writing off interests, a state agency should avoid being accused of disaster profiteering,” Recto said in a statement.\n",
      "The PITC had been tasked by President Duterte to purchase COVID-19 vaccines from abroad. Under proposed 2021 national budget, lawmakers set aside P8 billion for vaccine purchase, and another P10 billion in unprogrammed funds to be made available if government resources already available.According to Recto, the Department of Trade and Industry-attached agency charges a commission of four percent for projects with a total contract price (TCP) of P25 million and below; and one percent for projects with a TCP of P700 million and above.\n",
      "Recto said that if such charges are waived, “our cash-strapped, debt-assisted government will be able to save money which can be used to save lives and livelihood.”\n",
      "“Saan aabot, halimbawa, ang P100 million na service fee? Libo-libong PPE para sa ospital, milyon-milyong modules para sa mga paaralan (What could, for instance, a P100-million service fee afford? It could be used to buy thousands of personal protective equipment for hospitals, or millions of modules for our schools),” he pointed out.\n",
      "“The expectation that a government-to-government transaction will save money won’t happen if the government agency on the Philippine side will be entitled to an add-on,” he added.“If citizens and corporations alike are volunteering their services, equipment and facilities for free, a government corporation should do no less, and has no choice but to follow the bayanihan example,” he continued.\n",
      "Recto believed that the PITC and secretaries of concerned agencies will agree to his proposal, saying “they are good people.”\n",
      "The Senate leader said such a “no-commission” rule could also be included as a special provision in the 2021 budget bill, “which I am sure will pass muster in the Senate, concurred by the House, and risks no veto from the President.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The United States could be the first country to launch one of the most ambitious vaccine operations in history: distributing and administering up to 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine in just a few months.\n",
      "Filling and packaging tests for the large-scale production and supply of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate are pictured in September 2020 in Anagni Italy\n",
      "Massive vaccine campaigns are nothing new — they have been carried out for decades in the fight against the measles and flu, for example.But stamping out the coronavirus is a distinctly new challenge due to three factors: the short time frame for inoculating a huge number of people, the fact that most vaccines will require two doses, and the very low temperature at which some of the vaccines must be stored.The vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech, on track to be the first authorized for use in the United States, must be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit (-70 degrees Celsius), whereas the flu vaccine can be kept in a normal refrigerator.\n",
      "Pfizer vaccines distributed in the US will come from its largest manufacturing plant located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Their ship-out will include a precise, clockwork-like dance of containers, trucks and planes.\n",
      "Thermal shipping containers will each be filled with dry ice and 975 vials of the vaccine which each contain five doses, for a total of 4,875 doses.\n",
      "Every day six trucks will take the doses to air carriers such as FedEx, UPS or DHL, which will deliver them across the United States in one to two days and across the globe in three, Pfizer told AFP.\n",
      "The company expects an average of 20 daily cargo flights worldwide.\n",
      "FedEx had to obtain special permission from civil aviation authorities to transport so much dry ice, which could pose a danger to the crew should it accidentally undergo “sublimation” and pass from a solid to a gas, the company told AFP.\n",
      "Once the boxes have reached their final destination, they can be opened only briefly just two times a day.“To run a large mass vaccination clinic, it’s fine,” said Julie Swann, a pandemic response expert at North Carolina State University.\n",
      "But the vaccine would not be suitable for distribution at doctors’ offices or pharmacies, which are too small, she warned.\n",
      "At least in the beginning Americans will have to go to hospitals or maybe even large distribution centers set up in parking lots much like Covid test sites, she said.\n",
      "The vaccines can remain in their boxes for two weeks meaning hospitals will not need a special freezer.\n",
      "“We’re not recommending at this time that hospitals or clinics purchase ultra cold equipment,” said Janell Routh of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "– Poor countries later –\n",
      "US biotech giant Moderna is also manufacturing a vaccine, which can be stored at -4 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a normal freezer.\n",
      "The US government is organizing a free distribution of this vaccine to US states and territories, with each jurisdiction to decide how to distribute the doses to hospitals, pharmacies, doctors or even universities and companies will distribute the doses, in a decentralized system much like what was used for the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009.\n",
      "“The federal government does not intend, with very, very few exceptions, to touch a single dose of vaccine before it goes into the arm of Americans,” said Paul Mango, an Operation Warp Speed official, during a briefing.\n",
      "The objective is to offer vaccines to the most vulnerable populations before the end of December, to healthcare workers before the end of January and all Americans by the beginning of April.\n",
      "Pfizer expects to produce 50 million doses this year and 1.3 billion in 2021: The United States has already ordered 100 million total including 20-30 million for delivery before the end of December. The European Union meanwhile has ordered 200 million, Japan 120 million, Britain 30 million and Canada 20 million.\n",
      "Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi and others are hoping their own vaccines will also prove safe and effective, and their global rollout will follow suit.\n",
      "Carrier DHL estimates that 15 million cooling boxes would need to be delivered over the next two years, with approximately 15,000 flights needed worldwide.\n",
      "Poorer countries that lack storage capacity for large quantites of vaccines that need super-cold storage have little hope of benefiting from the first doses, said Prashant Yadav, an expert in global health supply chains at the Center for Global Development.\n",
      "Ultracold freezers that can reach temperatures of -112 degrees Fahrenheit cost five times more than standard freezers and are only made to order, he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez said Pfizer might sell the vaccine at $5 per shot to the Philippines once it gets regulatory approval from both US and Philippine authorities.\n",
      "Pfizer recently announced that initial late-stage clinical trials showed its vaccine is more than 90 percent effective in protecting the people from the new coronavirus. Safety data, however will still needs to be established before getting US authorization.“Right now, sila ang pinakanauuna ngayon dito sa Amerika na maa-approve dahil 90% ang efficacy ng Pfizer. Ang maganda diyan eh hindi naman ibibenta sa mga bayan kagaya natin na mahal dahil alam nila na tayo ay simple country, moderate (Right now, they will be the first in America that will be approved because Pfizer has 90 percent efficacy. The good thing is it will not sold at a high price to countries like ours because they know we are a simple, moderate country),” Romualdez said in a pre-recorded statement aired during Palace press briefing Tuesday.\n",
      "“So, it will be sold to many of their allies specifically in the Philippines na hindi naman gaano kamahal. It will probably be around $5 siguro per shot at maganda na iyon (So it will be sold to many of their allies specifically in the Philippines at a reasonable rate. It will probably be around $5 per shot. That’s good),” he said.\n",
      "Romualdez said if vaccine production starts this year, Pfizer would have to prioritize vaccine supply to the United States, which reportedly needs 100 million doses. “Pero (But) they are intending to produce as many as one billion by middle of next year,” he said.\n",
      "Romualdez admitted that Pfizer was the first US drug manufacturer that reached out to the Philippine authorities about its potential vaccine supply. He added that he has close communication with the Pfizer’s country manager in the Philippines.“Sila ang nagfo-follow-up diyan sa FDA natin na kapag once na na-approved tayo ng FDA natin diyan, they are prepared to already plan the supply for us (They have ben following up with our FDA that once the FDA approves the vaccine, they are prepared to already plan the supply for us),” he said.\n",
      "If Pfizer gets approval from the United States and Philippine Food and Drug Authority, he said vaccines could be made available by the first quarter of 2021.He said the company has not asked for any downpayment but a “purchase order” in case the government is interested in the vaccine acquisition.\n",
      "“Sa tingin ko by early next year, the first quarter magkakaroon na tayo ng by tranches iyan (I think by early next year, the first quarter, we may have supply by tranches),” he said.\n",
      "“We have a 180 countries who are affected by this virus. So the demand is very high, at least for the first tranches of this supply. Pero they are very confident na masu-supply nila lahat ng mga kailangan na mag-o-order ngayon (But they are confident they can supply all those in need who will order now),” he added.

      "“(Carlito) Galvez (Jr.) said government intends to buy an initial 50 million doses of vaccines for 25 million Filipinos. That means two doses per person. At US$5 dose or US $10 for two doses, that’s US $250-million or P12.5-billion needed to immunize 25 million Filipinos,” Drilon said in a statement.\n",
      "“The anti-insurgency fund for 2021 is P19-B. We do not have to borrow,” the minority leader said.\n",
      "Galvez, COVID-19 national task force chief, earlier said that the government is considering borrowing up to $9-billion from World Bank to help fund the government’s procurement of a COVID-19 vaccine which will primarily be administered to health workers.\n",

      "A nurse shows a COVID-19 vaccine produced by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech at the Sao Lucas Hospital, in Porto Alegre, Brazil. (AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The setback for CoronaVac, developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech, came on the same day US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said its own vaccine candidate had shown 90 percent effectiveness, sending global markets soaring and raising hopes of an end to the pandemic.\n",
      "The Brazilian regulator, Anvisa, said in a statement it had “ruled to interrupt the clinical study of the CoronaVac vaccine after a serious adverse incident” on October 29.It said it could not give details on what happened because of privacy regulations, but that such incidents included death, potentially fatal side effects, serious disability, hospitalization, birth defects and other “clinically significant events.”\n",
      "However, the public health center coordinating the trials of the vaccine in Brazil, the Butantan Institute, said it was “surprised” by the decision.\n",
      "The institute “is investigating in detail what happened,” and “is at the Brazilian regulatory agency’s disposal to provide any clarification necessary on any adverse incident the clinical trials may have presented,” it said.It said it would hold a press conference on Tuesday at 11:00 am (1400 GMT).CoronaVac has been caught up in a messy political battle in Brazil, where its most visible backer has been Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, a top opponent of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.\n",
      "The Sao Paulo state government said in a statement it “regrets that it learned of the decision from the press, instead of directly from Anvisa,” and was waiting along with the Butantan Institute for more information on “the real reasons for the suspension.”\n",
      "– Pandemic politics –\n",
      "Bolsonaro has labeled CoronaVac the vaccine from “that other country,” and pushed instead for a rival vaccine developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.\n",
      "Last month, he shot down a plan by his own health minister to buy 46 million doses of CoronaVac, saying, “The Brazilian people will not be anyone’s guinea pig,” and referring to it as “Joao Doria’s Chinese vaccine.”\n",
      "Doria announced earlier Monday that the first 120,000 doses of CoronaVac would arrive in Sao Paulo on November 20.\n",
      "His state has a deal with Sinovac to buy a total of 46 million doses — six million produced in China and the rest produced in Sao Paulo, which broke ground last week on a factory to make the vaccine domestically.\n",
      "“Officials in the state government fear Bolsonaro will use technical decisions to delay the timeline of the vaccine for political reasons,” newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported, citing unnamed Doria allies.\n",
      "Anvisa told AFP it had no comment beyond its statement announcing the suspension, which said that halting trials was standard procedure in such cases.\n",
      "Bolsonaro faces criticism for his handling of the pandemic, which has included downplaying the virus, opposing lockdown measures and relentlessly promoting the drug hydroxychloroquine despite studies showing it is ineffective against Covid-19.\n",

      "US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said tests involving more than 40,000 people had provided results that were a ”critical milestone” in the search for a vaccine, as global infections soared past 50 million — including an alarming 10 million now in the United States alone.\n",
      "Stock markets had already jumped after Democrat Joe Biden was called as the winner of the US presidential election on the weekend.They accelerated rapidly on the vaccine news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up three percent at Monday’s close of trade.\n",

      "”We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla said in a statement.\n",
      "The drug, being developed jointly with German firm BioNTech, is one of more than 40 candidate vaccines, but no other has yet made similar claims about its effectiveness.\n",
      "The companies said they could pass the final hurdles for a US rollout later this month, and could supply up to 50 million doses globally this year and up to 1.3 billion next year.The scientific community reacted positively, with top US expert Anthony Fauci describing the results as ”extraordinary.”\n",
      "World Health Organization director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed the news as ”encouraging” shortly after warning that the world ”might be tired of Covid-19. But it is not tired of us.”\n",
      "But others pointed out that no information had yet been disclosed about the ages of the participants in the trial.\n",
      "”If a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,” said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Edinburgh.\n",
      "Pfizer breakthrough\n",
      "A scientist who invented a technique that paved the way for Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine hailed the interim results announced by the companies Monday as “fantastic” and said the pioneering approach had a bright future.\n",
      "Drew Weissman, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told AFP: “I can’t remember the last respiratory virus vaccine that has over 90 percent efficacy,” referring to the rate at which the companies said their injection protected people against the disease.\n",
      "This is significantly higher than the 60-70 percent efficacy that had been mooted as possible by public health officials, and also much better than the 50 percent most influenza vaccines achieve — though the scientific community eagerly awaits the more detailed results.\n",
      "Both the Pfizer vaccine and one being developed by Moderna together with the US National Institutes of Health use molecules called “messenger RNA” — an approach that has never before been brought to approval.\n",
      "The idea was first demonstrated in 1990, but it wasn’t until the mid2000s that Weissman and colleague Katalin Kariko developed a technique to control a dangerous inflammatory response seen in animals exposed to these molecules, opening the way to develop safe human vaccines.\n",
      "Kariko is now a senior vice president at BioNTech, where Weissman serves as an advisor.\n",
      "Making the body a vaccine factory\n",
      "Vaccines work by training the body to recognize certain proteins, called “antigens,” that are made by disease-causing viruses or bacteria — priming the immune system to mount a response.\n",
      "Traditional vaccines, like those for measles or the flu, do this by either injecting people with small amounts of the virus, or by giving them weaker “attenuated” forms of the virus.\n",
      "“Those take a lot of time to develop and to optimize,” said Weissman.\n",
      "By contrast, this newer type of vaccine delivers the genetic instructions to build the antigens directly into cells, so that the human body itself is effectively turned into a vaccine making factory.\n",
      "The Covid-19 vaccines based on mRNA make human cells grow an antigen of SARS-CoV-2, known as the “spike protein,” on their surface.\n",
      "Biden task force\n",
      "Outgoing US President Donald Trump was among the first to react, writing on Twitter: ”STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS!”\n",
      "He later claimed on Twitter that news of progress on a vaccine had been delayed until after the election to damage him.\n",
      "The US Food and Drug Administration also reached a breakthrough Monday, granting emergency approval to a synthetic antibody treatment against COVID-19 developed by Eli Lilly. Bamlanivimab, which was shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and emergency room visits, is the first major drug to be approved that was designed specifically against the new coronavirus.\n",
      "American voters handed victory to Biden in part because Trump failed to rein in the epidemic — often refusing to back restrictive measures or even wear a mask in public and repeatedly undermining his own experts.\n",
      "Biden, who will not take office until January, has already announced a taskforce to tackle Covid-19, as confirmed infections soared past 10 million and American deaths neared 238,000.\n",
      "”We’re still facing a very dark winter,” he said.\n",
      "”The bottom line: I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around once we’re sworn in.”\n",
      "‘Out of control’\n",

      "State-owned trading arm Philippine International Trading Corp. (PTC) has been tapped to procure the COVID-19 vaccines as early as before the end of this year as the government pursues negotiations with foreign manufacturers.\n",
      "Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon M. Lopez\n",
      "Trade and Industry Secretary RamonM. Lopez said during the Malacanang Laging Handa press briefing that Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the Philippines’ Declared National Policy Against COVID-19, informed him Sunday night (Nov. 8, 2020) of the possibility to start the first batch of vaccines before the end of the year.This means, Lopez said, that government agencies are continuously looking at the selection and procurement of the vaccines. The Department of Budget and Management and PITC are involved in this effort. He said the PITC, where he is chairperson, has been tapped to execute the purchase of the vaccines.He said Science and Technology Secretary Fortunato Dela Pena and Galvez are talking to different companies through bilateral arrangements. He also cited lots of clinical trials ad tests being conducted as part of the ongoing R&D of the manufacturing firms that include the Russian manufacturer of the Sputnik 5 Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology.\n",

      "A vaccine jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech was 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials, the companies announced Monday.(Joe Raedle / Getty Images / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The statement was released as soaring coronavirus cases across the world have forced many millions of people back into lockdown, causing further damage to ravaged economies.\n",
      "European stock markets and oil prices jumped on the announcement.And US President Donald Trump, who lost last week’s election in part over his administration’s response to the pandemic, hailed the announcement as “such great news”.According to preliminary findings, protection in patients was achieved seven days after the second of two doses, and 28 days after the first.\n",
      "The companies said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.\n",
      "“The first set of results from our Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent Covid-19,” Pfizer chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.\n",
      "“We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” he said.\n",
      "“We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most.”\n",
      "Seeking emergency use authorisation\n",
      "Across much of the globe, Covid-19 infections rates are hitting record highs, with hospital intensive care units filling up and death tolls mounting.US biotech firm Moderna, several state-run Chinese labs, and a European project led by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca are also thought to be closing in on potentially viable vaccines.Two Russian Covid-19 vaccines have been registered for use even before clinical trials were completed, but have not been widely accepted outside of Russia.\n",
      "The Phase 3 clinical trial — the final stage — of the new vaccine, BNT162b2, began in late July and has enrolled 43,538 participants to date, 90 percent of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 8.\n",
      "Pfizer said it is gathering two months of safety data following the final dose — a requirement of the US Food and Drug Administration — to qualify for Emergency Use Authorization, which it expects by the third week in November.“We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks,” Bourla said.\n",
      "‘Watershed moment’\n",
      "While the Pfizer-BioNTech trial has yet to be peer-reviewed by experts, scientists reacted positively — if cautiously to the results.\n",
      "Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health, University of Southampton, called it an “excellent result for a first generation vaccine”.\n",
      "Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said Pfizer’s announcement “feels to me like a watershed moment” in the pandemic.\n",
      "But others pointed out that there would likely be significant logistical problems in getting the vaccine to everyone, especially given it must be kept super-cooled and currently requires two doses to bestow immunity.\n",
      "Eleanor Riley, professor of Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Edinburgh, said for example that the Monday’s results did not disclose the ages of participants.\n",
      "“If a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,” she said.\n",
      "Dozens more candidates\n",
      "The so-called messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine is a new approach to protecting against viral infection.\n",
      "Unlike traditional vaccines, which work by training the body to recognise and kill proteins produced by pathogens, mRNA tricks the patient’s immune system to produce viral proteins itself.The proteins are harmless, but sufficient to provoke a robust immune response.\n",
      "The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease.\n",
      "Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-review publication.\n",
      "As of mid-October, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 42 “candidate vaccines” at the stage of clinical trials, up from 11 in mid-June.Ten of them were at the most advanced phase 3 stage, in which a vaccine’s effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally tens of thousands of people across several continents.

      "If all things go according to plan, the Philippines is poised to procure 50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines — two doses each for 25 million Filipinos — by 2021, vaccine czar and National Task Force (NTF) chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. bared Monday.\n",
      "(PIXABAY / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Galvez made the remark as he announced that the Philippine National Vaccine Roadmap, a seven-point immunization plan to eradicate the threat of COVID-19, has been approved by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID) led by the Department of Health (DOH). It was presented to President Duterte last Thursday.\n",
      "“Sa kasalukuyan po, kami po ay nakikipag-usap sa embahada ng iba’t ibang bansa para sa G2G [government-to-government] at multilateral arrangements. Ang amin pong target ay makakuha tayo ng 50 million vaccines para sa 25 million nating kababayan this coming 2021 (Currently, we are in talks with embassies from different countries for government-to-government and multilateral arrangements. Our target is to get 50 million vaccines for 25 million countrymen [this] coming 2021),” he said in a virtual press briefing.For the “best case scenario,” Galvez said the country may be able to obtain about 10 to 15 million doses between May to July 2021 through bilateral and multilateral engagements with allied countries.\n",
      "The government is also banking on its participation in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) COVAX Facility, a ground-breaking collaboration among countries that was initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the remaining bulk of vaccines may be bought by the end of 2021 to early 2022 at “the worst case” scenario, with Galvez recognizing the huge global demand for the anticipated cure.\n",
      "“Talagang nakita natin na mayroon tayong kakulangan sa supply dahil ang mga mayayamang country ay kinuha na ang majority ng production. (We really have a shortage of supply because the rich countries already secured majority of the production),” he said.\n",
      "Securing the supply\n",
      "Currently, the government is in talks with various companies who offered 17 different vaccines for scrutiny by the DOH, Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and the Vaccine Expert Panel (VEP), Galvez shared.Of these companies, six are from the United States, three from China, and one each from Russia, Germany, Japan, India, and Israel among others.\n",
      "“Out of that 17 vaccines (manufacturers) na nakipag-ugnayan sa atin, 10 ang may bilateral, five ang nasa Covax Facility, and there are other countries na gustong makipag-arrange sa atin,” Galvez said.\n",
      "Among these are Astra-Zeneca, a United Kingdom-based company; and American companies Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax.\n",
      "“Sa lahat ng in-evaluate ng vaccine expert panel, Astra Zeneca ang may pinakamababang price with $5 per dose. Ngayon, tinitingnan natin sa negotiation ang access for 3 to 5 million [doses] pero ang inaano namin, at least 10 million doses for our frontliners,” Galvez said.\n",
      "Once the vaccines are available next year, among those who will be prioritized in the nationwide immunization program are the health care workers, other frontliners, essential workers, and the poor and vulnerable communities.\n",
      "Meanwhile, areas which recorded high COVID-19 cases will be prioritized in the planned nationwide immunization program.These areas will also be considered for the establishment of cold storage facilities where the vaccines will be stored.\n",
      "“Sa area o zoning, titingnan natin ‘yung areas na naging epicenter ng ating pandemic so nandito ang Metro Manila kasama ang Region 4A (Calabarzon), Region 3 (Central Luzon), Cebu at Davao City kasama ang Cagayan de Oro. Ito ang magiging major hubs sa mga cold storage facilities (In our zoning, we are looking at areas which became epicenters of our pandemic so it includes Metro Manila, Region 4A, Region 3, Cebu, and Davao City including Cagayn de Oro. These will become the major hubs for our cold storage facilities),” Galvez said.\n",

Ito po iyong prioritization of vaccine sang-ayon na rin sa ating Presidente: Unang-una, mauuna po iyong mga mahihirap at indigents. Ito po iyong nasa listahan natin ng 4Ps (Let’s go to who will be the first to receive the vaccines.

Pangatlo, lahat ng Pilipino ay makakatanggap ng bakuna without exception (Second, the frontliners, health care workers, soldiers, policemen, and those in essential services. Third, all Filipinos will receive the vaccine without exception),” he said.\n",
      "Under the roadmap, the government hopes the plans on vaccine selection as well as access and acquisition stages would be completed from November to December 2020. Roque said the safety and efficacy will be crucial considerations in the selection of the potential COVID vaccine. It will also be decided if a single or two doses will be needed.On how to gain access to the vaccine, Roque said the government has many options such as the COVAX with eight leading vaccine manufacturers, a government-to-government arrangement, and bilateral deals with the vaccine company.\n",
      "At present, he said, the government’s priorities for possible bilateral deals involve China, Russia, United States, Japan, South Korea, India, Israel, Singapore, Germany, and other ASEAN countries.\n",
      "Roque said there could also be a tripartite agreement between government-private sector and the private company. Other multilateral modes are possible pooled purchase by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and pooled purchase arranged by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and others.\n",
      "On the vaccine deployment, Roque said the Department of Health will handle the policy, standards, and strategy development for immunization. The tasks of the Health department include the cold chain transportation and other logistics, storage, and post-surveillance and monitoring.\n",

When asked about the President’s choice as the vaccine czar, Go expressed his support for the designation of National Task Force Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. as vaccine czar.\n",

      "Go reiterated his position that he has full confidence in General Galvez.‘’We need somebody with knowledge in logistics, supply chain, and crisis management. Let’s support him),” he said.He stressed the need for a single chain of command to ensure the vaccine’s orderly and swift distribution to the public.As vaccine czar, the former military chief shall be primarily responsible for the purchase, negotiation, manufacture, production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available.“Hindi kailangan [ng health expert] kasi distribution, financial ang kailangan nito at well-coordinated dapat ito sa baba sa pagdidistribute nitong vaccine (A [health expert] is not needed because what we need here is somebody who is good in distribution, financial, and well-coordinated on the ground when it comes to the distribution of the vaccines),” Go said.“[Dapat] handa ang accessibility, affordability, mga storage ng vaccine at saka financial scheme kung paano babayaran ito.

How to pay it, where to get it and how the distribution will be made? The distribution down to the level of our countrymen, especially in areas that have no access.)Recently, Go called on the DOH and concerned agencies to develop an overall strategy for distributing the COVID-19 vaccine to the general population.He also asked the government to ensure the speedy and uninterrupted supply of vaccines in the country by putting in place a national strategy to secure the supply chain for the COVID-19 vaccine, medicines and other related health commodities.\n",

      "Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon has renewed his push for a bigger budget for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, saying it is critical to allocate a huge amount to be able to cover more Filipinos for the mass vaccinations once these become available.\n",
      "Senator Franklin Drilon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Drilon noted that only a measly P2.4 billion has been allocated by the government for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "The senator said he supports the policy direction laid out by newly appointed vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. who said the government intends to purchase an initial batch of 24 million coronavirus vaccines once they become available next year.“We support the intention. There is a disconnect, however, between the government’s pronounced policy and the 2021 national budget,” Drilon said.\n",
      "“The National Expenditures Program for 2021 has not allocated sufficient funding for distributing and administering COVID-19 vaccines,” he said.\n",
      "“Obviously, the P2.4 billion earmarked for next year to purchase COVID-19 vaccines is grossly insufficient. The DoH said so that we are short of P10 billion but I believe it is way beyond that,” he added, citing huge logistical and human resource requirements.\n",
      "“That is why we will be pushing for more budget for the procurement and administration of potential coronavirus vaccines. Congress has to appropriate money to buy the vaccine and the best time to do it is now while we are deliberating on the spending outlay,” he said.Drilon also said he has qualms over the government’s readiness to administer the vaccines due to a lack of a clear distribution plan.\n",
      "“Buying the vaccine is not the end-all-be-all solution. It will require substantial funding and complex logistics. Who will administer the vaccines? Should we hire additional staff? Is the current DoH (Department of Health) workforce enough to administer it to 20 million Filipinos? Where do we plan to store the vaccines?” Drilon said.\n",
      "“The lack of clarity about these very critical matters will spell trouble next year,” he added.Drilon also renewed his push for the government to actively participate in bilateral and multilateral efforts to secure immediate access to vaccines. He cited the COVAX facility, a financing mechanism that helps low- and middle-income countries get access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“Clearly, the budget is not enough. I am dismayed at the apparent business-as-usual approach to this. It is reflected both in the budget and the apparent lack of a comprehensive coronavirus vaccine distribution plan,” he said.\n",
      "Drilon vowed to take up the issue when the Senate tackles the 2021 national budget on the floor in the coming weeks.\n",
      "“It is the best opportunity to debate on this issue. We must remember that public financing ensures widespread vaccination. We cannot leave it to the private sector.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., who was recently appointed by President Duterte as the vaccine czar bared Tuesday the “Philippine National Vaccine Roadmap,” a seven-point immunization plan by the national government to eradicate the threat of COVID-19.\n",
      "(Joe Raedle/Getty Images/AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "In a Laging Handa press briefing, Galvez said the initial plan will begin from November 2020 until March 2021 when the potential vaccine is expected to be made available.\n",
      "7 major stages\n",
      "The immunization plan has seven major stages.These are scientific evaluation; access and acquisition (guarantee of vaccine supply); procurement process; production, shipment and storage; distribution and deployment; implementation and nationwide vaccination; and assessment, evaluation and monitoring.\n",
      "Galvez said the first and second stages – the scientific evaluation, and access and acquisition of potential vaccines – should be completed already by November to December 2020.\n",
      "This will be initiated once they present the roadmap to Duterte on Thursday.\n",
      "Critical timeline\n",
      "“This is a critical timeline. The roadmap should be [approved] by the President this week,” said Galvez, who is also the chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 and the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unit (PAPRU).\n",
      "Within the last quarter of the year, Galvez said a National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 vaccination and panel of experts should be fully organized.\n",
      "Among the initial members of the task force are the Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology, University of the Philippines-National Institute of Health (UP-NIH), and Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).\n",
      "He said that clinical trials for the potential vaccine should also take place during this period, as well as the approval of the analysis, selection and procurement of the cure.\n",
      "The completion of the bilateral and multilateral engagements and arrangements with other countries and the private sector should also be done within this period.\n",
      "Stages 3 to 7\n",
      "Meanwhile, Galvez said they are targeting the commencement of stages three to seven in the first quarter of 2021.\n",
      "“Baka doon tayo magstart ng (Maybe that’s when we can start the) early procurement process and also the different stages including the production, shipment, and storage, early planning on distribution and deployment, and implementation [of the immunization plan],” he said.\n",
      "“Ito po ang aming (This is our) initial organizational roadmap wherein it is activity-based. Meaning from Stage 1 to Stage 7, ang organization po natin ay nagbabago (our organization will change). Kung saan ang activity ngayon, doon ang concentration ng tinatawag nating mga vaccine expert of panel (sic) and this will be led by the DOH, DOST, and the role of DFA and UP-NIH are very criticial,” he noted.\n",
      "6 primary considerations\n",
      "Through dialogues held with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Galvez said they have identified six primary considerations on the immunization plan namely: safety of the vaccine; efficacy; sensitivity or storage; cost and supply chain requirements; access for clinical trials and regional/local production and distribution; and complexity on its implementation.\n",
      "But within the given time frame, Galvez expressed confidence that they will achieve their targets hoping that a vaccine will be made available late this year or early next year.\n",
      "“Based on the report of Special Task Group on COVID-19 vaccine development, the earliest trial that we can have is maybe December.\n",
      "At the same time, we can have an available [vaccine], once the trials of Covax yield positive results, by March or May at the earliest. That is the prediction,” he said.\n",
      "10 vaccines\n",
      "There are 10 vaccine contenders in the country right now, eight of which are from COVAX, a global collaboration of countries to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccine, Galvez said.\n",
      "Among the pharmaceutical companies with promising trials is the United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca, which, according to Galvez, has a capacity to produce one billion vaccines by the end of the year.\n",
      "“Ito ang tinitignan natin (This is what we’re looking at). That’s why we are having an engagement with the Ambassaddor of UK so we can have some sort of diplomatic arrangement on how we can access this early the vaccines,” he said.\n",
      "Diplomatic talks\n",
      "The vaccine czar said he will also initiate diplomatic talks with representatives from China, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan – through the help of the DFA – so that the Philippines will have priority of a potential vaccine once it becomes available in the market.\n",
      "Talks with pharmaceutical giants Zuellig Pharma and Unilab, Inc. are also ongoing for the availability of cold chain storage facilities, Galvez bared.\n",
      "“There are pharmaceutical companies that have cold chain storage. May vaccine po na kailangan na negative 20 to negative 80 degree Celsius ang refrigeration,” he said.\n",
      "“Kung magpo-produce po tayo ng cold storage, tayo ang magproduce sa gobyerno, it will take time,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“If all goes well, we will be ready to distribute an initial number of doses,” said Bourla, who pointed to a US government contract for Pfizer to supply 40 million doses by the end of this year and 100 million doses by March 2021.But Bourla said the company still had not reached key benchmarks in assessing vaccine efficacy.Pfizer previously said it could have the data in October, which might have advanced the process ahead of the November 3 presidential election.\n",
      "“We have reached the last mile here,” Bourla said. “So let’s all have the patience that’s required for something so important for public health and the global economy.”\n",
      "He said the company expects to file for emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine in the third week of November, roughly in line with earlier timetables.\n",
      "Asked if he was “bullish” the vaccine would work, Bourla said: “I’m cautiously optimistic that the vaccine will work.”\n",
      "– Dip in doctor visits –\n",
      "Pfizer reported a 71 percent drop in profit to $2.2 billion in the latest quarter. However, the comparable period last year included a large gain connected to a transaction.\n",
      "Revenues dipped four percent to $12.1 billion, missing analyst estimates.Pfizer estimated a revenue hit of $500 million connected to Covid-19 due to lower pharma demand in China and fewer wellness visits by US patients.\n",
      "The company saw an 11 percent drop in its hospital business in emerging markets, primarily due to fewer elective surgeries in China and shorter in-patient hospital stays in the country.\n",
      "This effect was partially offset by increased demand for the Prevnar-13 vaccine for pneumonia “resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses,” the company said.Pfizer also cited strong performance in its biopharma business due to good sales for cancer drug Ibrance, anticoagulant Eliquis and other medications.\n",
      "Rival drugmaker Merck also is working on coronavirus vaccines, but the company is at an earlier phase compared with Pfizer.\n",
      "Merck said one coronavirus vaccine candidate had entered phase 1 development and a second candidate would reach that stage shortly.Merck reported a 55 percent jump in quarterly earnings to $2.9 billion on a one percent rise in revenues to $12.6 billion.\n",
      "Shares of Pfizer fell 1.3 percent to $37.43, while Merck shed 1.1 percent to $77.99. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

This is exactly what the DOH is doing right now to make sure that the cold chain is ready in case we already procure a vaccine),” said FDA Director-General Rolando Enrique Domingo during the Malacanang press briefing on Tuesday, Oct. 27.\n",

      "(For example, this vaccine should only be kept in places with two to eight degrees temperatures, when it is placed in an area with a temperature of 10 degrees, the color will suddenly change and that it can no longer be used. It will be discarded.)\n",
      "Sahar Pharmaceutical Representative Adeel Dhedi Bhyria said that it is best to prepare the storage equipment for vaccines right now before the supplies “run short.”\n",
      "“I believe the most important part right now is that the Philippines should procure the supply of these equipment before they run short and the prices will jack up naturally. Not later when the supplies for these equipment run short and then we’ll have to pay a higher price,” said Bhyria, who was also at the Malacañang press briefing. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Brazil is a top testing ground for vaccines against Covid-19, but its plans for vaccinating its own population have been plunged into chaos by a political war waged by President Jair Bolsonaro.\n",
      "In this file photo taken on July 24, 2020 Brazilian pediatric doctor Monica Levi, one of the volunteers who received the COVID-19 vaccine, works at the Specialized Clinic in Infectious and Parasitic Diseases and Immunizations (CEDIPI), in Sao Paulo, Brazil. (Photo by NELSON ALMEIDA / AFP)\n",
      "Hit hard by the new coronavirus, Brazil has been tapped to help test several of the leading vaccine candidates, giving it a potential edge in the race to secure access to an eventual shot.\n",
      "That could be a welcome silver lining for the country of 212 million people, which has the second-highest Covid-19 death toll in the world, at more than 157,000.But one promising test vaccine, developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech, has triggered the ire of the far-right president, who last week canceled his health minister’s plan to buy 46 million doses.\n",
      "The vaccine’s most visible proponent in Brazil is the governor of the large and wealthy state of Sao Paulo, Joao Doria, who also happens to be one of Bolsonaro’s top opponents.\n",
      "Thus “Joao Doria’s Chinese vaccine,” as Bolsonaro contemptuously called it, got caught up in an ideological firestorm fueled by jockeying for Brazil’s 2022 presidential election.\n",
      "“No country in the world is interested in it,” Bolsonaro said of the vaccine, known as CoronaVac.He nixed his own government’s purchase order after coming under pressure from hardline supporters to ban what one called the “Chinese dictatorship’s vaccine.”\n",
      "Bolsonaro, whose government has tense relations with Beijing, said China was “discredited” by the fact the virus “was born there.”\n",
      "– ‘Borderline absurd’ –\n",
      "“You have to read this situation in the context of the upcoming municipal elections (in November) and the presidential election” two years from now, when Bolsonaro is expected to seek a second term, said Geraldo Monteiro, a political scientist at Rio de Janeiro State University.“The vaccine is due to be produced (in Brazil) by the Butantan Institute, under the supervision of Sao Paulo state. That would be a political win for Doria, and (Bolsonaro) can’t allow that.”\n",
      "The pandemic has widened the rift between Bolsonaro and Doria, of the center-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB).\n",
      "Doria is a leading proponent of aggressive measures to contain the virus, while Bolsonaro has downplayed it as a “little flu” and railed against social distancing measures.\n",
      "“Bolsonaro has politicized the pandemic from the outset,” said Monteiro.\n",
      "“But some things can’t be politicized at the cost of people’s health. It’s completely irresponsible and borderline absurd.”Politics has displaced what ought to be the real debate around CoronaVac, said professor Anthony Pereira, head of the Brazil Institute at King’s College London.\n",
      "“Joao Doria is an ambitious politician and if an institute in his state produced a successful vaccine I have no doubt that he would try to benefit from that politically,” he said.\n",
      "“But the bottom line should be: does the vaccine work? Would it protect the health of the Brazilian people?”\n",
      "– Bolsonaro’s ‘biggest mistake’? –\n",
      "More than 85 percent of Brazilians say they want to be vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a poll in the journal Nature.\n",
      "But Bolsonaro’s “very problematic” attitude “causes doubts in the population about the vaccine,” said Lucio Renno, head of the Institute of Political Science at the University of Brasilia.\n",
      "Bolsonaro’s government has meanwhile allocated 1.9 billion reais ($338 million) to purchase 100 million doses of another vaccine being tested in Brazil, developed by Oxford University and Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.\n",
      "It is too early to say which vaccine or vaccines will emerge as the safest and most effective against Covid-19.\n",
      "“Being against (CoronaVac) for ideological reasons might become (Bolsonaro’s) biggest mistake,” said Renno.\n",
      "The president said Monday he saw no reason to stress over the race for a vaccine.\n",
      "“I don’t know why we should be running after this,” he told supporters outside the presidential palace in Brasilia.\n",
      "He then doubled down on his own preferred plan to handle the pandemic: hydroxychloroquine.\n",
      "Bolsonaro has pushed the drug despite a raft of studies finding it is ineffective against the new coronavirus, and took it himself when he contracted the virus in July.\n",
      "“Isn’t it cheaper and easier to invest in a cure than a vaccine?” he said.\n",
      "“Look at me: I took hydroxychloroquine…. And it worked.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque (RESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement after Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto urged Malacañang to appoint a “vaccine czar” to improve the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "Recto said that a vaccine czar will be needed to address the importance of distributing vaccines to 110 million Filipinos.In his Monday presser, Roque said that the government has already discussed naming a vaccine czar and that President Duterte has already named one but the appointment has not yet been announced.\n",
      "“The concept of a vaccine czar na tututok doon sa importation at doon sa (who will focus on the importation and) logistics has been discussed,” he said.\n",

      "Meanwhile, Roque said that the country’s envoys in other countries have been coordinating with companies who are working on a COVID-19 vaccine.“It’s a whole-nation approach. Ang mga ambassadors natin (our ambassadors) in the different countries that are developing vaccines are pro-active in ensuring and negotiating with the companies that we will have a just share of the vaccine once developed,” he said.\n",
      "This month, President Duterte assured the public that he has already found the money to buy COVID-19 vaccines. According to Malacañang, an initial 20 million Filipinos will get the vaccine for free.\n",
      "Roque said this month that the estimated price for a vaccine is US$10 per dose. An individual should have two doses of the vaccine.He added that if the vaccine will be available this year, the government would have to borrow from the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines to buy them. However, if it would be released next year, the funds for the vaccine will be taken from the proposed P4.5-trillion 2021 national budget. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“All the ongoing final stages of human clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of potential COVID-19 vaccines are for now targeting only the general adult population who are 18 years of age or older,” Defensor, House Committee on Health vice chairman, said in a statement.\n",
      "“While COVID-19 vaccines may possibly be approved for emergency use on the general adult population by the second half of 2021, drug regulators around the world, including our own Food and Drug Administration here, are bound to require further clinical studies to ascertain the safety of the boosters on children,” he pointed out.According to Defensor, children and pregnant women are usually the last to be tested when it comes to experimental biological products. He also noted that pharmaceutical agents “are targeting the general adult population.”\n",
      "“We must stress that all the prospective COVID-19 shots in advance trials are unlike other vaccines—such as those for measles, polio, and tetanus—that were designed from the start to be given to children,” he said.\n",

      "Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go (Facebook / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“It is important that this COVID-19 vaccine is safe for our countrymen,” Go said during a radio interview Saturday, adding that the proper development process must be followed before using a vaccine.\n",
      "According to Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque, the timeline of vaccine development and trial in the country is until March, 2021 – the time phase 3 trial is expected to be completed,” he said.“It means this will undergo clinical trials. It is important that this is safe for Filipinos,” he added.\n",

      "He warned against rushing the production and availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, saying “let us not rush it because it is important that this has to be tested and declared safe.”\n",
      "“We do not want another controversy to happen in this vaccine. The life of every Filipino is paramount,” he said.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Go said that there is an ongoing collaboration between multinational drug companies and Philippine authorities regarding the conduct of clinical trials and access to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "“I have also talked to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Administrator Director General Eric Domingo last night and there are various companies, like Sinovac, applying for trial in the Philippines. Now, the next move is to have a clinical trial here in our country and I’m sure that there are more offers coming,” Go said.The senator also urged the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the lead agency in charge of the COVID-19 clinical trials, to ensure that the processes are expedited but still in accordance with the applicable scientific standards.\n",
      "“We have to wait and be patient. It is important to ensure that this is safe. There is already an ongoing coordination with the World Health Organization on vaccine development and they have identified places and hospitals that will be used for the clinical trial phase 3,” he said.\n",
      "“It is important that this has to pass the clinical trials,” he pointed out.\n",
      "Earlier, Go said that the government had already set aside funds for the purchase and development of the COVID-19 vaccine and is looking to secure additional funding to expand the immunization program.\n",
      "Until then, Go encouraged the public to continue adhering to the health and safety protocols, such as wearing masks and face shields, observing social distancing and frequent hand washing, among others, to prevent the further spread of the virus.\n",

      "A decision support model that aims to provide an analytical and systematic approach in the allocation of COVID-19 drugs and hopefully vaccines once it becomes available was presented in a webinar led by the Dela Salle University Data Science Institute on Thursday, Oct. 22.Project Lead Dr. Charlle Sy of the Industrial Engineering Department of the DLSU, said that she along with her team during the onset of the pandemic, witnessed how the current healthcare system got overwhelmed with the surge of COVID-19 cases.\n",
      "“News outlets were reporting how hospitals have started to turn away patients and patients had to go from one hospital to another, just to look for empty spaces or empty beds,” Sy said.“And during that time. People were hoping that a vaccine would soon be developed… I guess we’ve come to realize that vaccines are a long way to go. And when that vaccine becomes available. The actual distribution is an entirely different problem,” she added.\n",
      "Sy mentioned that during that scenario, medical practitioners, pharmaceutical companies turned to repurposing commercially-available drugs like Remdesivir, to treat COVID patients which are only limited.\n",
      "“Everything that we have is limited in quantity, even if we want to distribute these drugs, even if we want to accommodate all patients, there’s simply enough or not enough supply to go around,” she said.\n",
      "Sy recalled that this became a topic of their group when the entirety of Luzon was placed under an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ).“One of the questions was that: How do we actually allocate these resources, do we give them to the most vulnerable? Those that probably would be under the senior age category? Or do we give them to those that would have the highest chance of surviving the disease?” she said.Being in the field of engineering, Sy and her team thought that there must be an analytical approach that will allow them to address the issue in a more systematic manner. They then decided to formulate a model that would address the questions while also considering multiple factors such as patient fatalities, drug efficiency, and hospital capacity.\n",
      "According to them, simulations show that using an optimal allocation plan was found to be better than simply allocating the drugs for a particular purpose when necessary.“We want to get the word out there that we’re doing something like this, because we believe that other people could help us enrich this by giving their own ideas and their own insights,” Sy said.\n",
      "She added that the logical next step now is to translate their present findings to vaccine allocations as it is anticipated to be developed in the future and that the allocation is a huge problem that needs to be tackled in an analytical way.\n",
      "They also aim to engage potential stakeholders in the industry.\n",
      "“This work couldn’t be done by a single group. If more groups are working on it, then there’s a better chance that it gets the objective that it wants to achieve,” Sy said.\n",
      "In August, the country reserved three million vaccines worth at least P1.5 billion through the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.COVAX requires that the country commits to a minimum of three percent of the population but assured that up to 20 percent can be procured once the vaccine becomes available.\n",
      "Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Health Research and Development Executive Director Dr. Jaime Montoya said three percent will be used for healthcare workers, frontliners, while the remaining 17 percent will be for high risk people like the elderly. The remaining 80 percent will then be negotiated. The webinar was presented together with Animo Labs Foundations Inc., a DLSU technology business incubator for the commercialization of research projects, inventions, and creative ideas.

He anticipated that the vaccine is expected to arrive in the country in April 2021 at the earliest.He announced that the Russia is committed to construct a pharmaceutical plant in the country to produce the vaccines.

      "A volunteer participating in clinical trials of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University has died in Brazil, officials announced Wednesday, though media reports said he had received a placebo, not the test vaccine.\n",
      "A clinical trial of a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University will continue despite the death of a volunteer in Brazil, as a review did not reveal safety concerns Vincenzo PINTO AFP/File\n",
      "It is the first death reported in the various coronavirus vaccine trials taking place worldwide.\n",
      "However, organizers of the study said an independent review had concluded there were no safety concerns and that testing of the vaccine, developed with pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, would continue.Media reports said the volunteer was a 28-year-old doctor working on the front lines of the pandemic who died of complications from Covid-19.\n",
      "Brazilian newspaper Globo and international news agency Bloomberg said he was in the control group and had received a placebo rather than the test vaccine, citing sources close to the trials.\n",
      "“Following careful assessment of this case in Brazil, there have been no concerns about safety of the clinical trial, and the independent review in addition to the Brazilian regulator have recommended that the trial should continue,” Oxford said in a statement.\n",
      "AstraZeneca said medical confidentiality meant it could not give details on any individual volunteer, but that independent review had “not led to any concerns about continuation of the ongoing study.”Brazil’s national health regulator, Anvisa, confirmed it had been notified of the case on October 19.\n",
      "The D’Or Teaching and Research Institute (IDOR), which is helping organize the tests in Brazil, said the independent review had “raised no doubts about the safety of the study, and recommended it continue.”\n",
      "Oxford and AstraZeneca previously had to suspend testing of the vaccine in September when a volunteer in Britain developed an unexplained illness.\n",
      "Trials resumed after British regulators and an independent review concluded the illness was not a side effect of the vaccine.\n",
      "Half the volunteers in the final-stage clinical trial — a double-blind, randomized, controlled study — receive a placebo, IDOR said.\n",
      "Around 8,000 volunteers have been vaccinated so far in Brazil, and more than 20,000 worldwide, it said.\n",
      "Study participants must be doctors, nurses or other health sector workers who come into regular contact with the virus.\n",
      "The deceased volunteer was a young doctor who had been treating Covid-19 patients since March in the emergency rooms and intensive care units at two hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Globo said.\n",
      "He graduated from medical school last year, and was in good health prior to contracting the disease, family and friends told the newspaper. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Senator Panfilo “Ping” Lacson on Tuesday said he is inclined to support “institutional” amendments that seek to augment the budget for the acquisition of COVID-19 vaccines under the proposed national budget for 2021.\n",
      "Senator Panfilo M. Lacson\n",
      "(SENATE OF THE PHILIPPINES / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "“Without admitting the regularity and even the constitutionality of the post 3rd reading ‘institutional amendments’ by the (Lower) House as mentioned, I will definitely support and might even further augment the proposed amendments for the COVID-19 vaccines and the aid to displaced workers,” Lacson said when sought to comment on the P20-billion institutional amendment introduced by the House of Representatives committee in the budget bill.“That said, regardless of the constitutional infirmities involved, we can remedy it anyway by formalizing those flawed and constitutionally infirm amendments by the House when the Senate approves our own version of the budget measure all the way to the bicameral conference,” he further said.In an interview on CNN Philippines, Lacson said the P2.5-billion allocated by the government to procure the vaccines is insufficient to cover the 3.9 million Filipinos that need to be covered by the vaccination.“There’s only P2.5-billion for vaccines to cover 3.9 million Filipinos. Assuming there’s a vaccine available in April 2021, kulang na kulang ang P2.5-billion,” Lacson said.“So I’m thinking of augmenting another P10-Billion or at least ma-approximate ang P10-billion to cover more Filipinos. Kasi 3.9 million of 100 millionFilipinos masyadong maliit ang mako-cover (is such a small coverage),” he pointed out.And despite the “constitutional infirmities” involved, Lacson welcomed the House’s move to add P5-billion for the COVID-19 vaccines.“That’s good because we’ll just formalize it. I am not saying we are accepting the amendments introduced by the HOR after (found to be) not in compliance with (the) third reading approved budget version. Pero we’ll formalize it in the Senate and probably in the bicam (bicameral conference committee) we can finalize it,” he stressed.“Pagka may vaccines na next year, kailangan talaga natin (Once we have the vaccines next year, we really need)to cover as many Filipinos as we can. Kasi kung 3.9 million lang, how about the other 96 million Filipinos? Maghahawa-hawa rin yan (they will still infect the others),” Lacson pointed out. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“We are working diligently to fulfill our constitutional duty of ensuring that funding for a safe and effective vaccine to control COVID-19 is guaranteed and will be available to Filipinos,” Romualdez said.Initially, some P2.5 billion have been included in the proposed national budget for 2021 for COVID-19 vaccines, especially in the spending plan of the Department of Health (DOH).\n",
      "Romualdez said the P5.5 billion additional funding for the procurement of the vaccines is among theP20 billion institutional amendments made by the small committee in the 2021 General Appropriations Bill (GAB).He noted that his panel agreed to consider only institutional amendments and departmental errata.He added that the individual amendments will be accommodated during the bicameral conference committee when both the House and Senate come up with the final version of the spending measure.The Lower Chamber is seeking to transmit to the Senate the soft copy of the House-approved GAB containing its P20-billion institutional amendments on October 28.\n",

      "Some P5.5 billion in the 2021 General Appropriations Bill (GAB) will be set aside for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, House Ways and Means Committee chairman Albay Rep. Joey Salceda said Monday.\n",
      "Albay Rep. Joey Salceda\n",
      "(Albay Rep. Joey Salceda’s office / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Salceda, in a virtual press briefing, said the allocation comes in the form of institutional amendments to the GAB of which a total of P20 billion was approved by the House small committee.He said the vaccine allocation was the single biggest item among the budget amendments.\n",
      "“Actually it came from the Speaker (Lord Allan Velasco). May listahan siyang pina-consider sa amin pero hindi naman namin lahat sinunod (He gave us a list to consider but we didn’t follow all of it),” said Salceda.He said the P5.5 billion will be added to the P2-billion fund for vaccines that solons set aside earlier.“The needs are fairly obvious eh. Why is the biggest item for vaccines? I don’t think there will be any argument that you need to fund vaccines beyond the P2 billion,” the Bicolano said.Acknowledging that the funds aren’t huge, Salceda said the P20 billion under the National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF) may be tapped for the purchase of vaccines. “Because pandemic is defined under RA (Republic Act) 10121 as a disaster.”\n",
      "Salceda pegged the cost of the as yet unavailable vaccine at P700 per shot. He said Filipinos with comorbidities and senior citizens would be prioritized for the vaccine in order to maximize the limited funds.The Philippines has an estimated population of 110 million people.Salceda also bared that the institutional amendments to the budget measure would include P2 billion worth of “pandemic assistance to afflicted families.”He said another P300 million will be funneled to the Department of Health for “mental health” purposes – something that presumably is also meant to mitigate the ongoing public health crisis.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the second largest item among the amendments is the P4-billion allocation to the Department of Labor and Employment. It will be used for the benefit of workers displaced by the pandemic, Salceda said.\n",
      "The rest of the amendments are as follows: P2 billion to the Armed Forces of the Philippines for the acquisition of two C-130 planes; P2 billion for the Health Facilities Enhancement Program, basically to complete construction of unfinished hospitals; P2 billion to the Department of Interior and Local Government for police mobility assets; P1.75 billion to the Department of Education for Internet connectivity; P500 million to the Energy Regulatory Commission for self-sufficiency and renewable energy (RE); and P400 million to the Philippine National Oil Company for redevelopment and modernization.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) urged the government not to prioritize those who are “wealthy, powerful, and influential” once the vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available.\n",
      "In a moral guidance, the CBCP said that the government should ensure that the vaccine should be given first to those “who are most at risk for infection and for severe disease.”\n",
      "“We propose this allocation plan for the COVID-19 vaccine that prioritizes those who are at most risk for infection or for severe disease because of our concern that in the Philippines, vaccines may be allocated first to those who are wealthy, powerful, and influential,” said the CBCP.“Pope Francis has said, ‘It would be sad if, for the vaccine for COVID-19, priority were to be given to the richest!’ As the pope has said many times, ‘The preferential option for the poor is at the center of the Gospel,’” it added.\n",
      "The CBCP said that prioritizing those in the upper class will not help in immediately solving the current health situation.\n",
      "“This would not efficiently mitigate deaths in our communities and would delay the end of the pandemic in our country. This would be a great moral and social tragedy,” it said.\n",
      "Medical frontliners should be the top priority for immunization, the CBCP said, as the country needs “healthy doctors and nurses to treat our sick so that our people can heal.”Adults who are at high risk for severe disease due to their age or underlying medical conditions should be next to receive a vaccine, the prelates said. “We especially need to shield our senior citizens who face the highest risk of death from COVID-19,” they said.\n",
      "Third to prioritize should be essential workers “whose roles are inherently risky because of necessary interactions with the public,” the CBCP said.\n",
      "These include teachers, grocery store workers, public transportation workers, police, firefighters, and national security personnel, among others, it said.Individuals who are living in “dense urban areas where they are vulnerable to the virus” should also be prioritized, the prelates said.\n",
      "“We urge our national government to provide the COVID-19 vaccine to everyone without cost to the individual. Otherwise it will not be available to the poor,” the CBCP said.\n",
      "The government should be transparent and ensure the welfare of those who will volunteer to participate in any clinical trials for COVID-19 candidate vaccines, the CBCP said.\n",
      "By doing so, this will help bolster “public confidence in the initiatives of medical and governmental authorities,” it said.\n",
      "“We remind our public health authorities and the pharmaceutical companies involved that these COVID-19 vaccine Phase III clinical trials must be conducted adhering to the highest ethical standards and best scientific practices,” the CBCP said.\n",
      "“Full transparency is critical at every step of the development and distribution of a candidate vaccine to ensure the safety and effectiveness of every approved vaccine in an immunization campaign,” it added.\n",
      "Before any Phase III clinical trial commences, the results of the Phase I and II clinical trials of candidate vaccines should be first evaluated by designated ethics and expert panels and approved by our national regulatory agencies, the CBCP said.\n",
      "“The data should be made publicly available so that other scientists and medical professionals can confirm the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine,” it said.\n",
      "“Every participant in these clinical trials must be guaranteed the highest possible standard of care if they experience any adverse reactions. In the case of unforeseen permanent bodily damage, or even death, compensation to the participant or family would be just,” it added.\n",
      "The findings of the Phase III clinical trials must be made public, regardless of outcome, the CBCP said.\n",

      "Congress should allocate at least P20 billion, not the measly P2.5 billion under the 2021 budget proposal, to procure COVID-19 vaccine next year if the government is serious in protecting an initial 20 million poor Filipinos from the dreaded disease.\n",
      "Anakalusugan Rep. Mike Defensor said the P2.5-billion allocation reflected in the proposed 2021 General Appropriations Act “is just a small fraction of what government needs to vaccinate the initial target of 20 million poor Filipinos.”\n",
      "“That means an average of P1,000 per Filipino to be inoculated. Health professionals are saying one would need two to three doses to fight the infectious new coronavirus. If that is so, P1,000 would translate to P500 per dose, if two doses are needed, and P333, if three doses are required,” said Defensor, chairman of the House Committee on Public Accounts.He said multinational drug companies and the richest nations developing the new vaccine are not expected to distribute their precious invention cheap.“We will be lucky if we could get it at less than P500 per dose,” Defensor stated.He pointed out that the initial target is only roughly one-fifth or 20 percent of the country’s entire population.Defensor said assuming the vaccine would cost P500 per dose and one would require two doses, the P2.5 billion in next year’s budget would be good only for 2.5 million Filipinos.\n",
      "“And President Duterte is aiming to inoculate all 113 million Filipinos. Clearly, there is a need for us to provide sufficient funds. There is still time to do it because the proposed budget is still with us in Congress,” he said.Defensor noted that the Department of Health has estimated its funding requirement for 20 million poor Filipinos at P12.9 billion, or P645 per vaccine.“Their estimate means that a dose would cost only P322.50, if two doses are needed. I hope they are right. But there’s no harm in allocating an amount that would exceed the actual cost of the vaccine. The excess would be used in procuring more vaccines, which means more Filipinos would be vaccinated.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“Sinopharm has made a change of mind. Before, they said that they want to provide a supply of vaccines as well as to get involved in the clinical trials Phase III in the Philippines,” said DOST Secretary Fortunato Dela Pena in an online forum hosted by the Department of Health (DOH).“But later on, they have communicated to us that they are still interested in the supply side but they are no longer going to conduct clinical trials Phase III,” he added.\n",
      "There are six pharmaceutical firms that have signed a confidentiality disclosure agreement that would let the Philippines’ vaccine experts panel review the results of their respective Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials.These are the Gamaleye Research Institute from Russia, University of Queensland from Australia; Adimmune from Taiwan, and the Sinovac, Sinopharm and Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical from China.Dela Peña also confirmed that China’s Sinovac Biotech has passed the evaluation of the country’s vaccine expert panel but still needs to secure approval from the Single Joint Ethics Research Board and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they could commence the Phase III clinical trial of their candidate vaccine.“They are just waiting for the approval or endorsement of the Single Joint Ethics Research Board,” said Dela Peña.“Once they receive the final approval for the clinical trial from our FDA, the implementation will be fully undertaken by their local contract research organization (CRO), that can facilitate and help them in the actual implementation of the vaccine trials,” said the DOST chief.“We hope that they will be able to have already selected the contract research organizations. This is Philippine-based organizations,” he added.As for Russia’s Sputnik V, Dela Peña said that they are still evaluating its application for clinical trials.\n",

      "Professor Zha DaojiongAround the world, great hope is placed on vaccines as an instrument for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. With the winter flu season in the northern hemisphere and many societies still struggling with containing the spread of the virus, loosening of international travel restrictions continues to be limited, which in turn hampers the world’s return to normalcy.\n",
      "Much progress has been achieved in the search for vaccines. Yet, vaccine production necessitates a constant process of refinement through research, clinical trials, and gathering of data to prove its safety and effectiveness. Only upon approval by national health authorities can a vaccine be mass-produced and then made available for mass inoculation, with the eventual goal of realizing mass immunity.\n",
      "Around 40 candidate vaccines are registered with the World Health Organization (WHO), with nine of them – four by Chinese vaccine developers — in the third and final clinal trial phase. For any of these products to successfully reach the state of mass use, there is still a scientific process to complete. Some inevitably are to be eliminated.Production of a vaccine is a demanding endeavor in terms of financial and technological input. Quality assurance is a necessary precondition, which must result from proven health safety and effectiveness on human participants in the development process. Only a few countries have the resources to produce vaccines to meet demand for immunization of their own populations.\n",
      "Accordingly, some countries opt to partake in vaccine development initiated in other countries, including bottling and transportation. Some other countries will have to procure from available international pool of successful vaccines. The WHO’s vaccine prequalification offers a technical reference for such procurement.\n",
      "Globally, gaps between demand for vaccines and available dosages are a predictable reality, at least in the initial stage, partly due to uncertainty a producer faces in marketable doses of a product. To address this foreseeable challenge, the WHO, in collaboration with the Global Alliance of Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) offered the Covax Facility arrangement. The facility envisions making available two billion doses of COVID vaccines for use in middle- and low-income developing countries, covering some 20 percent of their total populations.\n",
      "Against the odds, vaccine nationalism is a common choice of action by developed countries equipped with the scientific and technological capacity as well as financial resources to cover the associated costs. Although no vaccine has yet received approval for use, with only candidate vaccines that meet technical standards for emergency use, several developed country governments have signed advance purchase agreements with vaccine developing corporations to satisfy future needs of their respective domestic populations. The United States, Great Britain, European member states, and Japan are said to have secured right to 130 million doses potential COVID vaccines.Accessibility is but one of the many challenges the world is facing in vaccine distribution. If COVID vaccines are sold at market price levels, most low-income and some mid-income countries will encounter the predicament of affordability. To be fair, though, even with commonly available vaccines, affordability is a long-standing challenge for developing economies. GAVI, an alliance of vaccine producers, addresses the matter by dividing developing country beneficiaries into two categories, with one having to pay full costs and the other subsidized prices.\n",
      "Covax Facility is a multilateral arrangement. Its proponents champion it as the biggest effort at international cooperation since the Paris climate agreement. Emergence of the arrangement manifests acceptance of treating international health as a public good, which China champions. Product developers and users negotiate through the platform to realize the goal of mutual protection.\n",
      "Vaccine nationalism, meanwhile, has its historical precedent. To deal with the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010, a small number of developed economies chose to bond with each other on the merit of research and paying capabilities, with a few even hoarding successful vaccines. Developing economies were offered the product only after deployment needs had been met in developed ones, by which time the pandemic had come to an end. There resulted a surplus and waste of vaccines. As such, vaccine nationalism can be a double-edged sword.COVID-19 is an entirely different challenge, unprecedented in one century. Economies will be tempted to ensure and expand domestic capacities of vaccine production. But a scenario cannot be ruled out whereby curbs are imposed on global movement of materials for vaccine ingredients, packaging, and injection. That will be another form of vaccine nationalism. After all, cross-national flow of vaccine products is a component of international competition in trade and investment, which comes with its share of frictions and conflicts over product branding and extended economic and political interests.\n",
      "In the real world, public health is a sphere in which geopolitically motivated maneuvering takes place. Procurement of a vaccine, when a product’s nationality becomes a core choice factor, can become yet another manifestation of vaccine nationalism. For a procurement decision to be made without due regard to scientific facts behind pathobiology would be against common sense in therapeutic terms. It might earn some momentary gains in political maneuvering but amount to irresponsibility towards citizens so affected.\n",
      "According to publicized information, in the Covax Facility, China is not going to receive preferential treatment when it comes to per unit price of participating vaccines, reflecting the fact that its per capita income is in the upper level of middle income economies. But China stands to have an opportunity to function as both a product supplier and purchaser under the platform, especially in the event of domestic product falling short of meeting demand. As a supplier, joining group negotiation can help save time and human resource input that comes with relying on bilateral channels.\n",
      "A multilateral arrangement for COVID vaccine distribution, meanwhile, should not be viewed as a confrontation with acts of vaccine nationalism. The prevailing COVID-19 challenges are such that spread of the virus pays no regard to an individual’s nationality, nation-state boundaries, or gaps in aggregate or individual capacity to afford a product. The sooner and the more societies reach the stage of herd immunity through effective immunization by vaccination, the greater for realization of hope for trade and travel to restore normalcy among various economies. In this sense, practices of multilateralism in vaccine access and affordability are also in line with protecting an economy’s own public health security.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, many nations, including members of the European Union, have opted to join multilateral vaccine arrangements, in addition to pursuing bilateral means of product acquisition.\n",
      "The world’s search for etiological origins of the COVID-19 virus is still under way. Whether or not future demand for a COVID vaccine will evaporate, like that in the wake of the SARS pandemic in 2002-2003, remains an unknown as well.\n",
      "All in all, the world is witnessing a race between vaccine nationalism and multilateralism. Being part of a multilateral arrangement is one way to prepare for multiple future scenarios.\n",

      "The financing “aims to support vaccination of up to a billion people,” the bank said in a statement.\n",
      "The money is part of an overall World Bank Group (WBG) package of up to $160 billion through June 2021 designed to help developing countries battle the novel coronavirus pandemic.“This financing package helps signal to the research and pharmaceutical industry that citizens in developing countries also need access to safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines,” the statement read.“It will also provide financing and technical support so that developing countries can prepare for deploying vaccines at scale, in coordination with international partners.”\n",
      "Access to safe and effective vaccines “and strengthened delivery systems is key to alter the course of the pandemic and help countries experiencing catastrophic economic and fiscal impacts move toward a resilient recovery,” World Bank Group President David Malpass said in the statement.\n",
      "The financing “will also support countries to access to Covid-19 tests and treatments, and expand immunization capacity to help health systems deploy the vaccines effectively,” the statement added.The financing approval was expected as Malpass had announced the project in late September.\n",
      "While vaccines have yet to appear on the market, Malpass noted in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro that it was necessary to prepare because of the complicated vaccine distribution process.\n",
      "The Bank’s approach, according to the statement, draws on its “significant expertise in supporting large scale immunization programs for vaccine preventable diseases, as well as public health programs to tackle infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The country has covered all bases in getting access to potential coronavirus vaccines but will need the approval of the proposed 2021 national budget for the funding allocation, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said.\n",
      "Nograles said the government’s budget proposal for next year includes the allocation for the procurement of the life-saving vaccines for the coronavirus.\n",
      "“Ang tanong may pambayad ba tayo. Iba ‘yung access, iba ang pambayad so kaya nga worried din tayo at nag-aalala tayo sa budget na 2021 (The question is do we have the budget to pay for the vaccines. Access is different from budget for payment. So we are worried about the 2021 national budget),” Roque said during a forum on Facebook.“Ayaw natin mabulilyaso ‘yan at magkanda-leche-leche ang budget na ‘yan dahil nakapaloob sa 2021 budget ‘yung nakapaloob pondo para sa vaccines (We don’t want the budget measure botched or bungled because the 2021 budget includes the funds for the vaccines),” he added.\n",
      "If the new spending plan is not passed on time, Nograles said the government will be compelled to operate on a reenacted budget, which does not include any budget item for vaccine purchase. He said the government would have look for other funding sources to buy the vaccines.\n",
      "President Duterte has called on Congress to convene a special session from Oct. 13 to 16 to resume the deliberations on the proposed P4.506-trillion national budget for next year and avoid delays on its passage. The budget measure, which carries the theme “Reset, Rebound, and Recover: Investing for Resiliency and Sustainability,” has also been certified as urgent by the President to facilitate its swift congressional approval.\n",
      "Under the budget bill, the government has proposed an initial P2.5 billion for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.The special session was called by the President in the wake of the escalating leadership conflict between Speaker Alan Cayetano and Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco the House of Representatives threatened to disrupt the passage of the budget on time.\n",
      "So far, Nograles assured the public that the government has made arrangements to “reserve” the country’s access to potential COVID vaccines.\n",
      "He said the country is involved with the World Health Organization’s solidarity trial as well as the COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access) facility, a global vaccine project to ensure equitable access for poor nations to the vaccines.The government has also coordinated with those developing vaccines in Russia, China, and United States for the country’s access once the medicines become available, Nograles said.\n",
      "“So all bases covered tayo kasi ang mangyayari dito nag-uunahan ang lahat, kung sino ang unang maka-produce ng vaccine. Kahit sino sa kanila ang mauna, naka-reserve na tayo (We have all bases covered because everyone is racing to be the first to produce the vaccine. So whoever becomes first, we have reserved our access),” he said.\n",

      "DAVAO CITY – The Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) has been tapped to participate in the clinical trials of potential coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines in the Philippines.\n",
      "In a phone interview, Dr. Ricardo Audan, office-in-charge (OIC) medical center chief, revealed that the government-run hospital was identified as one of the trial sites for the conduct of a large-scale Phase 3 of the clinical trials on potential vaccines against COVID-19.\n",
      "Audan added that he received last week a letter from the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), informing him that SPMC has been selected as a trial site.The Department of Health (DOH) earlier confirmed that the Philippines was one of the countries “that will participate in the World Health Organization’s Solidarity Trial for Vaccines, a global effort to rapidly develop and evaluate possible candidate vaccines against the COVID-19.”\n",
      "Audan said the DOST-PCHRD has been tasked to conduct clinical trials for the vaccines.\n",
      "“The SPMC will be part of the vaccine trial, although it has yet to start,” he said.\n",
      "He added that the hospital would comply with the requirements of the DOST-PCHRD.“I presented it during our task force regular meeting at the SPMC. There are several requirements before a hospital could participate but, by principle, we will accept it,” he said.\n",
      "Audan added that he was confident that SPMC would be able to comply with the requirements just in time for the start of the vaccine trials.\n",
      "He said the agency has not identified which potential vaccine would be tested in the government-run hospital.The Gamaleya Research Institute from Russia, Jannsen Pharmaceuticals Companies of Johnson & Johnson from the United States, and Sinovac from China have applied to do clinical trials in the Philippines.\n",
      "The 1,500-bed SPMC is the country’s largest government hospital catering to patient-referrals from other regions outside Davao, and is the biggest COVID-19 referral hospital in Mindanao.The region’s three COVID-19 referral hospitals are SPMC, Davao Regional Medical Center in Tagum City, and Davao Doctors Hospital’s Dumoy facility in Davao City.\n",
      "As of October 9, DOH-Davao reported a total of 3,464 COVID cases in the region with 2,753 recoveries and 114 deaths.\n",
      "Of this total, 2,244 were reported in Davao City, 242 in Davao de Oro, 387 in Davao del Norte, 224 in Davao del Sur, 86 in Davao Occidental, and 281 in Davao Oriental. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Speaking in the daily “Laging Handa” briefing of the government, Tolentino said that while he respects the DOST, the matter should be left to the expertise of medical doctors in the Department of Health (DOH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n",
      "“Bakit napunta sa DOST (Why was is designated to the DOST)? Ginagalang ko po ‘yon, mga scientist po ‘yon pero dapat po ito purely (I respect that they are also scientists but this is purely a DOH mandate, to include the FDA,” Tolentino said.“Dahil ang clinical trials po ay tungkol po ito sa medisina.

Igor Khovaev the possibility of manufacturing and distributing Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines during the Ambassador’s farewell courtesy call Tuesday, October 6, 2020.\n",
      "DTI Undersecretary Ceferino S. Rodolfo, who is also Board of Investment managing head, said that Philippines and Russia also agreed the need to strengthen the ongoing Joint Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation (JCTEC), which covers the areas of trade, investment, and other economic cooperation projects between the two nations.Rodolfo said the JCTEC is slated to meet in November this year wherein “the important part of the JTEC meeting agenda is the collaboration on vaccines.”\n",
      "While Rodolfo said that the discussion was still preliminary, the discussions appeared to be already gaining ground with Russia having discussed the plan through their Manila embassy with the Department of Health and the Department of Science and Technology.\n",
      "The DOST through Assistant Leah Buendia has already engaged with Russia’s Gamaleya Institute and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). Alexander Zhuravlev, senior vice-president of the investment department of RDIF has presented Gamaleya’s Sputnik V vaccine last September 18. The Russian Sputnik V is touted as the world’s first Human Adenovirus Vector-based COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "“The offer of Russia is not only to supply vaccines, but also to collaborate for the manufacturing of the vaccine in the Philippines. Ambassador Igor emphasized that Russia is the only country who also offers in-country manufacturing of the vaccine,” said Rodolfo.DTI Assistant Secretary Allan Gepty said that Russia is willing to venture into manufacturing provided there is a pharma company that can handle full scale production of vaccines. “I think this is something that the Philippines will have to prepare or build capacity,” he said.\n",
      "Gepty explained that the roadmap of the vaccine development in the Philippines is in the medium term to have a local pharma company to establish a fill and finish for the vaccine. In the long term, a virology science and technology institute has been requested to be established (currently a bill is filed in Congress) to build the capability initially for R and D and eventually to have our own full-scale vaccine manufacturing.\n",
      "On the joint clinical trial, Gepty said that per Food and Drugs Administration there is an ethnicity requirement/racial similarity needed as part of the protocol in the approval process of vaccine. “Right now, most of the subjects in the clinical trial conducted are Russians,” he said.“It is important that it undergoes all related Philippine rules and regulations, including conduct of joint clinical trials,” he said.\n",
      "Rodolfo likewise stressed that it is important that the vaccine undergoes all the related Philippine rules and regulations, including the conduct of joint clinical trials and follow the requirements of the DOH, Food and Drug Administration and DOST.\n",
      "The plan though is part of the joint clinical trials and the immediate provision of vaccine supply after the third phase and regulatory approval that they will follow all local rules and regulations related to this e.g. conduct of joint 3rd-phase clinical trial for the Sputnik V.\n",
      "During the meeting, the Russian ambassador also mentioned that aside from Gamaleya, two other entities in Russia are also developing vaccines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“Data from Phase 3 studies should include a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen to help provide adequate information to assess a vaccine’s benefit-risk profile,” the document said.The two companies that are furthest along in their vaccine trials, Moderna and Pfizer, both began their final stages at the end of July, and both require two separate injections 28 days apart.\n",
      "That would mean that only the first few people who signed up for the trial would have completed the follow-up period by the end of October, and there would probably not be enough data to apply for emergency use.\n",

      "Conduct of the vaccine trials for the first batch of candidate vaccines from the World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to commence in the fourth week of October, the top official of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) disclosed.\n",
      "DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña mentioned the update on the WHO Solidarity Trial for Vaccines during his weekly report on Friday. He said that this also includes the recruitment of volunteer vaccine recipients.\n",
      "He also said that the conduct of the trial needs to pass all levels of the approval process, such as from the Vaccine Expert Panel, Ethics Review Board, and the country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to comply with the WHO protocol, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and submission of the necessary documentary requirements.“Since the aforementioned protocol and SOPs are yet to be released by the WHO, the vaccine teams are currently preparing the hospital sites and are planning the community trial sites for the smooth implementation of the said trials,” Dela Pena added.\n",
      "DOST is funding the local implementation of the WHO Solidarity Trial amounting to P89.1 Million.The project’s main implementer is the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) with Dr. Jodor Lim as the overall principal investigator. There are 11 participating hospitals that will serve as trial sites of the project.On September 3, theInter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) approved through Resolution No. 68 the zoning guideline for the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials as recommended by the Sub-TWG on Vaccine Development through the assistance of the DOST Vaccine Expert Panel.\n",
      "The guideline is being issued to avoid competition for clinical trial sites among vaccine developers. The DOST, as sub-TWG chair, will also form a separate Data and Safety Monitoring Committee whose role will be important in monitoring the safety of the vaccines under the WHO Solidarity Trials while the study is ongoing.A comprehensive communication plan has also been developed by the DOH Health Promotion and Communication Office with the help of DOST, Philippine Health Research Ethics Board (PHREB), PGH and other concerned agencies to inform the general public about the trials; promote transparency, cautious optimism, global cooperation, volunteerism and ownership, and ethics in relation to the upcoming clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines.

      "Amid the global race to come up with a safe and effective drug to fight the coronavirus pandemic, President Duterte is “most hopeful” about the vaccine development being done by China, Malacañang said Thursday.\n",
      "President Rodrigo Roa Duterte\n",
      "(RICHARD MADELO / PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Presidential spokesman Harry Roque disclosed the President’s preference for the potential China-made vaccine even as pharmaceutical firms from other countries are also making progress in the development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus disease.\n",
      "“All the vaccines are undergoing third- and final-phase clinical tests,” Roque said during a press briefing in Bataan.“The President is most hopeful with China but he has also said that Johnson and Johnson is on track,” he added.\n",
      "Citing latest information, Roque also said Moderna, a pharmaceutical firm based in the United States, has also produced “very promising results” in the third phase of clinical trials of its potential vaccine.\n",
      "Roque said the Philippines is likewise closely coordinating with Russian authorities on its potential COVID-19 vaccine. He noted that proposed Sputnik V vaccine will undergo third clinical trials both in Russia and the Philippines.\n",
      "“Iyong sa England po nag-resume na sila, panandaliang tinigil (the England-based firmhas resumed the trials after briefly stopping the trial),” he said.According to Roque, the global race to find the coronavirus vaccine will be good for the people as the pandemic has infected more than 34.1 million across the world.\n",
      "“Now alam ninyo naman po kasi ang nature ng pharmaceutical industries ‘no, nag-uunahan po iyan which is good for us ‘no. Nag-uunahan iyan at alam po nila kung sino mauna, sila po iyong kikita nang pinakamalaki (Now you know the nature of pharmaceutical industries. They are trying to be the first which is good for us. They know whoever becomes first, it will earn the biggest),” he said.\n",
      "“So let’s hope that the free market this time will really come to our rescue and will incentivize the drug manufacturers to come up with vaccine sooner than later,” he said.The President earlier said the government will buy the most affordable vaccine that will be sold in the market give its limited resources.Under the Bayanihan 2 law, the government has a standby fund of P10 billion for COVID testing and procurement of medicines and vaccines.\n",
      "Duterte also remained optimistic the situation will return to normal by December once the vaccine becomes available. The government’s immunization drive will prioritize the poor, soldiers, and police and the middle class families. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "NEW YORK, United States – The United Nations and its partners on Thursday welcomed a monumental show of solidarity as governments, private sector, civil society and international organizations committed support to the Access to COVID-19 Tools- (ACT) Accelerator initiative launched by the World Health Organization alongside international partners.\n",
      "Nearly US$1 billion in new financing has been committed to the initiative – the world’s most comprehensive multilateral end-to-end solution to the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "The ACT-Accelerator, which was co-launched by the World Health Organization, European Commission, France and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation just five months ago, needs an additional US$35 billion to realize its goals of producing 2 billion vaccine doses, 245 million treatments and 500 million tests. The new commitments to the initiative are welcome and will be leveraged to catalyze further funding to continue the ACT-Accelerator’s groundbreaking work.Most urgently, the ACT-Accelerator requires US$15 billion to support immediate capacity-building—for research and development, manufacturing, procurement and delivery systems—by the end of the year.\n",
      "Convening a high-level event at the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly to urgently mobilize support for the ACT-Accelerator, Secretary-General António Guterres commended on the “extraordinary international effort to address a human crisis like no other in our lifetimes,” adding that more efforts must be made to further “deepen” the remarkable progress so far.\n",
      "“It is in every country’s national and economic self-interest to work together to massively expand access to tests and treatments, and to support a vaccine as a global public good—a “people’s vaccine” available and affordable for everyone, everywhere.”\n",
      "”The ACT-Accelerator—including its COVAX Facility—is the vehicle to get us there. Investing in the ACT-Accelerator will accelerate every country’s own recovery,” said Mr. Guterres who co-hosted the event with the United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, South Africa’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, and the Director-General of World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n",
      "Unprecedented Global Collaboration\n",
      "The ACT-Accelerator, which was launched just five months ago, is an unprecedented global collaboration of the world’s top international health organizations working together to accelerate the development, production, and equitable delivery of COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.\n",
      "“We have a duty to ensure vaccines, treatments and tests for COVID-19 are available to all—stopping the global spread of the pandemic protects the British people and will put humanity on the road to recovery. Collaboration through the ACT-Accelerator is critical to promoting development, production and access for all countries,” said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.\n",
      "The United Kingdom recently committed up to £571m (approximately US$ 732m) for COVAX. This includes up to £500m for the Gavi Advanced Market Commitment for COVID-19 (COVAX AMC) vaccines—a financing instrument that incentivises vaccine manufacturers to produce sufficient COVID-19 vaccines to ensure access for developing countries.\n",
      "The UK Foreign Secretary called for more support, pledging that this £500m commitment would include £1 (IS$ 1.29) in matched funding for every US$4 committed by others for up to £250m (approximately US$ 321m).\n",
      "Germany, Canada and Sweden have also made new commitments to the COVAX AMC of Euro 100 million, CAD$ 220 million and US$ 10 million respectively. These are eligible for matching with today’s UK matching commitment.\n",
      "”Science is giving us solutions, in the form of new tests, therapeutics and­—hopefully—a vaccine. But science and solutions will be ineffective without solidarity,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.\n",
      "“I am grateful for the generous financial commitments made today, but we still have a significant funding gap to close. Fully financing the ACT Accelerator will help to control the pandemic, restore confidence and stimulate the global recovery. Frankly, this is not a financial challenge, it’s a test of solidarity. This is a moment for saying no to nationalism and yes to our shared humanity. Because ultimately, the ACT Accelerator is not delivering merely vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. It’s delivering something far more important—hope.”\n",
      "“We must confront this health crisis as a global challenge, together in solidarity and cooperation with one another, working toward a global solution. We have to generate the key tests, treatments and vaccines that we all need, and make sure they are distributed equitably to people who most need them, regardless of where they live and whether their country is wealthy or not,” said South Africa’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, adding that large parts of the population especially in developing countries remain “vulnerable and marginalized during this pandemic.”\n",
      "The event highlighted the substantial results achieved by the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator initiative since its launch: the availability of 120 million affordable and high-quality rapid tests for low- and middle-income countries; a breakthrough in trials with, and a rapid rollout of, Dexamethasone—the only drug found to make a significant difference to patient mortality; the creation of the COVAX Facility – the global mechanism to ensure equitable access to eventual COVID-19 vaccines regardless of income -comprising 168 economies and the largest and most diverse vaccine portfolio in the world, with nine candidate vaccines under evaluation, eight of them in clinical trials.\n",
      "In another significant show of support, a coalition of 16 pharmaceutical companies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation signed an agreement to cooperate on vaccine manufacturing and to scale up production at an unprecedented speed, ensuring that approved vaccines are more broadly accessible and distributed as early as possible.\n",
      "Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said “One thing I’ve learned studying the history of pandemics is that they create a surprising dynamic when it comes to self-interest and altruism. Pandemics are rare cases where a country’s instinct to help itself is tightly aligned with its instinct to help others. The self-interested thing and the altruistic thing–making sure poor nations have access to vaccines–are one and the same.”\n",
      "“A number of countries, most recently the United Kingdom and Canada, are good models for what other wealthy nations should do. They have donated enough money for COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the ACT-Accelerator, to procure, probably, hundreds of millions of vaccine doses for poor countries. But more will be needed and I hope wealthy nations will continue to be generous.”\n",
      "The World Bank unveiled plans this week for a significant financial commitment to support developing countries to purchase COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they are available.\n",
      "World Bank President David Malpass said that once the plans are ratified by stakeholders, “having up to US$ 12 billion available in finance will be a game changer because once a safe and effective vaccine is available, it will allow people to resume their lives with confidence.”\n",
      "Investing in Global Recovery\n",
      "The ACT-Accelerator Investment Case illustrates the considerable economic benefits of collectively accelerating the development and deployment of tools to rapidly reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 disease globally. Prior to UNGA 2020, the ACT-Accelerator has raised US$3 billion out of a need of US$38 billion. More detail can be found in the Act-Accelerator investment case.\n",
      "The economic rationale for investing in an approach that can accelerate the end of the COVID-19 crisis remains clear. Fully financing the initiative to help shorten the duration of the crisis would pay back this investment in less than 36 hours once global mobility and trade alone are restored.

      "Stephane Bancel told the newspaper: “November 25 is the time we will have enough safety data to be able to put into an EUA file that we would send to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) — assuming that the safety data is good, i.e. a vaccine is deemed to be safe.”Trump, whose approval has taken a hit over his handling of the Covid-19 crisis, has frequently hinted a vaccine could be ready before the November 3 vote.\n",

      "(OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“I implore the DOST, as the lead agency in charge of the clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines in Metro Manila, CALABARZON, and Cebu, to ensure that the vaccine trials are expedited but still in accordance with applicable scientific standards,” Go said\n",
      "“Please make sure that the vaccine is safe. ‘Yun lang po ang importante para po hindi matakot ang ating mga kababayan. Siguraduhin natin na safe ang mga vaccine na nasa trial stages na po sa ngayon,” he added. (It is important that we dispel the doubts or fears of our countrymen. Let us make sure that these vaccines are safe as they are now in the final stages of trials.) \n",
      "The DOST had earlier said that the World Health Organization’s Solidarity Trial of potential COVID-19 vaccines will likely start in December.\n",
      "According to DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña, once WHO releases the vaccines and protocols, the Philippines can then begin recruiting patients to participate in the trials which will likely be in October.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Go expressed his support for the proposed budgets of the DOST and the Philippine Space Agency (PSA).\n",
      "“I express my support for the budget of the Department of Science and Technology and the Philippine Space Agency,” Go said.“I especially laud the department, led by its very hardworking Secretary Fortunato dela Peña, in striving to continuously improve our efforts in research and development in science and technology. With your efforts, together with the rest of the government, we will overcome this crisis,” he said.\n",
      "Go also recognized the achievements the science and technology department has attained recently. In the Global Innovation Index 2020, the Philippines rose from 100th in 2014 to 50th this year.\n",
      "“It is a symbol of hope for the country that is currently fighting the pandemic. Indeed, hard work and the constant pursuit of excellence do pay off. But let us not be complacent,’’ he said.Go noted that the country, through its science and research arm, “can still improve, and we should. We, in the Legislative Branch, are behind you and will do our part to help.”\n",
      "On the country’s venture towards becoming a space-capable nation, Go also expressed his excitement over the country’s push for PhilSA.“I also take this opportunity to express my excitement over the country’s first real push into becoming a space-capable and space-faring nation within the next decade, as embodied in the Philippine Space Act,” Go said.\n",
      "The PhilSA was formed after the Philippine Space Act was passed into law in July last year. One of its main policies is to safeguard Philippine sovereignty, territorial integrity, Philippine interest, and the right to self-determination as mandated by Article II, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution. It also intends to support and commit to the development, application, and utilization of science and technology that will foster patriotism and nationalism and accelerate social progress, such as the development of space technology and applications for its security and for the benefit of its citizens.\n",
      "“Every great nation has the goal of seizing the space frontier and I am happy to see the country take its first steps toward the realization of this lofty goal,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“Talagang best case scenario yun [That’s the best case scenario], meaning yung three to six months (of clinical trials), magiging three months; assuming that they will complete all their analysis and submit immediately to FDA,” he added.Domingo noted that the approval of a vaccine really depends on the completion of the phase 3 clinical trials.\n",

      "Withholding the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine — the most effective means of mass salvation — is a weapon of mass destruction, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said on Tuesday.Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. (PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Locsin made this point in a speech during the virtual High-Level Meeting commemorating the 75th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting where he raised concerns about making the universal accessibility to potential COVID vaccines without preconditions.“You know decency when you see it; it is indecent when you don’t. A case soon to be made in point will be the universal availability of COVID vaccines without requiring any people, class or country to submit to another’s will as the price of cure,” the country’s top diplomat said.\n",
      "He noted that the UN, being the only globally credible platform, remains the essential organization as the world is grappling to fight the pandemic.While Locsin renewed the country’s commitment to the multilateral body, he, however, cautioned that multilateralism “cannot be owned by select member states, let alone one.”\n",
      "“It is by and for all — or no one. COVID-19 reminds us of humanity’s common fate, the perishability of life, progress and social order, and of the imperative of coordinated international action even in concerns we’d always regarded as too small to bother the world with. The virus is tiny,” he said.Moreover, the foreign affairs chief pointed out that the UN is the “core of the present multilateral global order and must stay that way.”\n",
      "“As long as the UN exists, none can trumpet the end of multilateralism. But it must be a UN strengthened in its every member; so that together they can achieve peace, democracy and prosperity in a world where every state is accountable for the consequences of its action or inaction; where any of “we, the peoples…” can put up a credible fight long enough to make our case for UN help,” Locsin said.Last week, President Duterte vowed to prioritize procuring COVID-19 vaccine from Russia or China, while criticizing pharmaceutical firms of western nations for reportedly asking for advance payment for their offers.

      "After Robredo criticized the government’s pandemic response, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque challenged the Vice President to come up with a plan to resolve the pandemic that will not depend on the development of a vaccine.\n",
      "“Hinahamon ko po si VP Leni, kung mayroon siyang solusyon na walang vaccine at wala pa ring gamot, sabihin po niya, dahil sigurado po baka ngayon din maging Presidente siya kung makahanap siya ng solusyon habang walang bakuna at walang gamot (I am challenging VP Leni. If she has a solution that does not need a vaccine and a cure, tell us. Because I’m sure she might immediately become the president if she can present a solution while there is no vaccine and cure),” he said during a televised press briefing.Robredo earlier declared that the President’s plan to wait for the coronavirus vaccine to effectively address the pandemic was not enough.She instead proposed that medical and non-medical measures should be pursued to suppress the pandemic in the country. She said the pandemic cannot be resolved by spraying pesticides from an airplane as suggested by President.\n",
      "The pandemic response, she added, should involve overcoming humanitarian emergencies including poverty, hunger, unemployment, mental distress, and other COVID-19 related problems; restructuring public and private finances; and rebuilding an inclusive, resilient and sustainable economy.\n",
      "Roque, however, asked Robredo and the rest of the opposition bloc to open their “eyes and ears” to the government’s improved efforts to address the pandemic. He said they have apparently ignored the improved testing, tracing and treatment efforts made by the government.“Wala raw tayong ginagawa. Well, sila lang ‘ata ang hindi nakakaalam kung anong ginagawa ng gobyerno. Buksan po ang mga mata at buksan po ang mga pandinig (We are supposedly doing nothing. Well, it seems they are the only ones who don’t know what the government is doing. Better open your eyes and ears),” he said.\n",
      "In his televised address Monday night, the President hit back at Robredo and other “dilawan” critics for allegedly making “reckless statements” that the government was not doing enough to address the pandemic. Duterte said he did not know what the critics still wanted from the government, citing efforts that have already enhanced country’s healthcare capacity.\n",
      "“They are trying to delude people about — they are trying to picture that there is a failure of government. We have done our best. We have responded to the medical needs,” he said. “We are surviving and we are only waiting for the vaccine,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "GENEVA – More than 60 wealthy nations have joined a WHO backed program to facilitate poor countries’ access to coronavirus vaccines, but the US and China are not on the list published Monday.\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has in coordination with the global vaccine alliance group Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) created a mechanism aimed at ensuring a more equitable distribution of any future Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "But the mechanism, known as Covax, has struggled to raise the funds needed to provide for the 92 low-income countries and other economies that quickly signed up.WHO had encouraged richer nations to step up to the plate by the end of last week and when the deadline fell, 64 were onboard with another 38 expected to join in “coming days”, the three organizations said in a joint statement.\n",
      "Among those who have signed up are “the European Commission … on behalf of 27 EU member states plus Norway and Iceland,” it said.\n",
      "The United States, which under President Donald Trump has relentlessly criticised the WHO’s handling of the pandemic and which is in the process of withdrawing from the organization, is not on the list.\n",
      "And China, where the novel coronavirus first surfaced late last year, is also absent.“The purpose of the Covax facility is to try to work with every country in the world,” Gavi chief Seth Berkley told a virtual briefing when asked about China’s absence from the list.\n",
      "“I can assure you that we have had conversations and will continue to have conversations with all countries,” he said.\n",
      "‘Not charity’In addition to working to get more countries to join Covax, Berkley said there was also an ongoing dialogue with vaccine-producing countries about “’if they have successful vaccines that come out, how we can make sure they are made available to others in the world.”\n",
      "The aim is for Covax to lay its hands on two billion doses of safe and effective vaccines by the end of 2021. But the mechanism is facing a range of significant challenges, not least a serious funding shortfall.\n",
      "The WHO has said some $38 billion is needed for its overall ACTAccelerator program, which includes Covax, but also global collaboration towards developing and ensuring equitable access to tests and treatments for COVID-19, and strengthening health systems. But so far it has received just $3.0 billion of that.\n",
      "WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus voiced optimism that so many countries – representing nearly two-thirds of the global population – had agreed to participate in the mechanism.\n",
      "“COVID-19 is an unprecedented global crisis that demands an unprecedented global response,” he said in the statement, warning countries against scrambling to acquire vaccine stocks for their populations alone.“Vaccine nationalism will only perpetuate the disease and prolong the global recovery,” he said.\n",

      "The clinical trials\n",
      "Dr. Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination said that the people involved in the trials will be monitored from the time they are given the vaccine up to five years after, depending on safety concerns.“There is a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) overlooking the trial and they can stop the trial anytime if there are concerns, or continue the trial after certain numbers have been enrolled,” Dr. Bravo said.\n",
      "The World Health Organization Solidarity Trials, which has yet to announce the vaccines to be used, will run for 18 months while the Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Sputnik V, the Russian vaccine, will run for three to six months.\n",
      "The Solidarity Trials and the Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Sputnik are different in method and scope.According to Department of Science and Technology Secretary Fortunato dela Pena, an estimated 1,000 participants are required for the WHO Solidarity trials since about 80 countries will be part of it. The Philippines is participating in the Solidarity trials.\n",
      "Sputnik, the Russian vaccine candidate, will be conducting Phase 3 clinical trials to test efficacy and monitor adverse reactions. There will be about 1,000 Filipinos who will be part of the Phase 3 clinical trials.\n",
      "Dr. Bravo, who has been part of conducting vaccine trials in the country for 30 years, said that there had been no case of a participant who died during a vaccine trial.\n",
      "“There is always a liability clause in the informed consent that every volunteer signs before the trial…there is insurance… dependent on DALY and age etc,” Dr. Bravo said. (Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) is the computed amount of life years and income a person loses if he becomes disabled.)\n",
      "“People who have been in vaccine trials usually ask when the next one will be so they can get their friends and family included. In other words they’re happy that they were taken care of and given top quality care during the conduct of the trials,” she added.\n",
      "Foreign policies on clinical trials\n",
      "China is currently testing 16 different vaccine candidates, according to data from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Following China is the United States with 11 ongoing trials, and Russia with six.\n",
      "According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)’s ClinRegs’s website, clinical trials in China a vaccine trial must first undergo a regulatory authority and ethics committee review before they are conducted.\n",
      "A clinical trial approval in China takes 60 business days, according to the Backer McKenzie Clinical Trials Handbook (Asia Pacific).\n",
      "In the United States, regulation of vaccines is done by the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. All sponsors of new vaccines in the US must undergo a “multi-step approval process.”\n",
      "“Also included are information about the vaccine’s safety and ability to elicit a protective immune response in animal testing, as well as the proposed clinical protocol for studies in humans,” the US FDA said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Only 20 percent of the P12.9 billion needed to purchase vaccines against COVID-19 has been included in the proposed operational budget of the Department of Health (DOH) next year.\n",
      "Health Assistant Secretary Maria Vergeire (Facebook)\n",
      "DOH officials made this revelation even as clinical trials for the vaccine endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO)for the Solidarity trials are expected to start next month.In the budget hearing for the P127 billion proposed 2021 allocation for DOH, Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire said WHO is expected to announce within September the areas where clinical trials will be conducted.“WHO ang pipili ng ilan sa mga bakuna na nasa advance stages at isasama sa clinical trials.Baka makapag-umpisa na ang clinical trials ng WHO bago matapos and October (WHO will choose certain vaccines in advance stages that will be included in the clinical trials.Its possible WHO clinical trials will start before the end of October),” Vergeire told members of the House Committee on Appropriations yesterday.But while the Philippines is assured access to the successful Solidarity trial vaccine, it might resort to borrowing money to be able to purchase enough to protect Filipinos against COVID 19.Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje admitted that only P2.5 million has been allocated for the purpose, even while a minimum P12.9 million may be needed for the vaccination program.Cabotaje said this will prompt government to resort to loans to be able to cover the cash shortage for the vaccine.“Uutang po sa Landbank, the purchase will be made by PITC-Pharmaceutical under DTI (Departmnt of Trade)” the health official said.\n",
      "To repay the loans, government will allocate loan servicing allocation in the proposed DOH budget in the coming years.’Aside from problems on the availability of money to purchase anti-COVID 19 vaccines, Philippines, being a small nation, faces the prospect of losing out in the scramble for limited vaccine supplies.Oxfam, a non-government organization, disclosed that wealthy nations have already been assured of getting more than 50 percent of the estimated vaccine production next year.“What will be produced next year, may not be able to meet global demands,” Cabotaje said.\n",
      "Thus, whatever vaccine the Philippine may acquire will be injected first to medical frontliners. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "WASHINGTON – US biotech firm Moderna, one of nine companies in the late stages of clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine, became the first to publish the complete blueprints of its study following calls for greater transparency.This combination of file pictures created on August 05, 2020 shows a sign for Pfizer pharmaceutical company on a building in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on March 18, 2017 and the Moderna headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts on May 18, 2020.

      "Pfizer, the other American company currently carrying out Phase 3 trials in the US, followed suit a short time later and there is now added pressure for the remainder to do the same.Phase 3 is the final stage before approval, in which a vaccine and a placebo are tested on thousands of participants to verify the medicine is safe and effective.\n",
      "The vaccine race has become deeply politicized in the US in the run-up to the presidential election in November, as President Donald Trump touts a quick vaccine in response to criticism of his handling of the pandemic.“I don’t trust Donald Trump,” his rival from the Democratic party Joe Biden said Wednesday. Moderna’s CEO Stephane Bancel said on Thursday his company would know whether their vaccine works by November.October is possible but unlikely, he told CNBC.The trial protocol published Thursday, which runs to 135 pages and is marked “confidential,” fixes the parameters of the experiment.\n",
      "The most important of these is how it will judge whether results are conclusive.Wait for it The reality of an immunization trial is that it’s necessary to wait until a certain number of volunteers become naturally infected, in order to compare outcomes in the placebo group against the group given the vaccine.So the decline in the rate of infection in the US could theoretically delay the results – possibly until December, said Bancel.\n",
      "As of Thursday, Moderna had recruited 25,296 volunteers.Among them, 10,025 had received their second dose, 28 days after the first.It’ll take a few more weeks to recruit the full quotient of 30,000 participants and for them to receive their second doses.Only COVID-19 infections recorded two weeks or more after the second dose are counted, to give the vaccine sufficient time to take effect.Interim analyses by a committee of independent experts are planned over the course of the trial to verify whether a high statistical threshold of effectiveness has been reached, and to monitor for serious side effects.\n",
      "The FDA has stated its bar for approval is a vaccine that reduces the risk of falling sick with COVID-19 by 50 percent.The Moderna trial protocol “has the key information (for) stopping rules, interim analyses and efficacy assumptions.Applaud their transparency,” Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute and one of the critics leading the charge against possible political interference, told AFP.Pressure on Moderna also said that 28 percent of its participants were from racial minority groups.Having sufficient participants among black and Hispanic people in particular is crucial in obtaining statistically representative results for these communities that have been disproportionately hit by the pandemic.The decision by Moderna, which has received $2.5 billion in US government money, left a spotlight on Pfizer, whose CEO has repeatedly said the company will have its results by the end of October, which is in line with Trump’s wishes.A spokeswoman told AFP Pfizer has traditionally not shared the full in-depth study protocol, but “the COVID-19 pandemic is a unique circumstance and the need for transparency is clear.”“As a result, the company is making the full protocol for its self-funded COVID-19 vaccine pivotal study available to reinforce Pfizer’s longstanding commitment to scientific and regulatory rigor that benefits patients.”The other frontrunner is AstraZeneca, which has codeveloped a vaccine with the University of Oxford.The medicine’s global trials were suspended last week after a participant had an unexplained illness, but were later restarted in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa.The US remains the exception for reasons that aren’t yet known.

      "A group of wealthy nations representing 13 percent of the global population have already bought up more than half of the promised doses of future Covid-19 vaccines, according to a report by Oxfam on Wednesday.\n",
      "The non-governmental organization analyzed deals struck by pharmaceuticals and vaccine producers for the five leading vaccine candidates currently in late-stage trials, based on data collected by the analytics company Airfinity.\n",
      "“Access to a life-saving vaccine shouldn’t depend on where you live or how much money you have,” said Robert Silverman of Oxfam America.\n",
      "“The development and approval of a safe and effective vaccine is crucial, but equally important is making sure the vaccines are available and affordable to everyone. Covid-19 anywhere is Covid-19 everywhere.”\n",
      "The five vaccines analyzed were from AstraZeneca, Gamaleya/Sputnik, Moderna, Pfizer and Sinovac.\n",
      "Oxfam calculated the combined production capacity of these five vaccine candidates at 5.9 billion doses, enough for three billion people given that all five future vaccines will or are highly likely to require two doses.Supply deals have so far been agreed for 5.3 billion doses, of which 2.7 billion (51 percent) have been bought by developed countries, territories and regions, including the US, UK, European Union, Australia, Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, Switzerland and Israel.\n",
      "The remaining 2.6 billion doses have been bought by or promised to developing countries including India, Bangladesh, China, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico, among others.\n",
      "The non-profit added that one of the leading candidates, developed by Moderna, has received $2.5 billion in committed taxpayers’ money, but has said it intends to make a profit and has sold the options for all its supply to rich nations.\n",
      "Oxfam and other organizations are therefore calling for a “people’s vaccine” free of charge, distributed fairly based on need.\n",
      "“This will only be possible if pharmaceutical corporations allow vaccines to be produced as widely as possible by freely sharing their knowledge free of patents, instead of protecting their monopolies and selling to the highest bidder,” Oxfam said.\n",

      "Health experts have been encouraging the public to get flu vaccine as it prevents the development of symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, body aches, fatigue, and sore throat.It would also help in lessening the public’s “unnecessary anxiety” or fear of contracting the deadly disease.“Although the flu vaccine cannot prevent COVID-19, it can still help protect even the most vulnerable against complications from the disease, making it a beneficial option one can take advantage of to keep ourselves health,” the MHD said in a statement.\n",

      "Before this, the fastest vaccine developed was for mumps, for four yearsCoronavirus vaccines are rapidly advancing through the development pipeline. The University of Oxford’s vaccine is in large trials in Brazil, Britain, and South Africa. In the US, researchers just began enrolling around 30,000 volunteers to test Moderna’s vaccine, and more trials are starting every day.\n",
      "At the rate researchers are working on their projects, a number of these vaccines will almost certainly beat the record for speed of development. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years. Work on the candidate Covid-19 vaccines started in January and there is a good chance at least one may be available for mass immunization before the yearend. That’s less than a year. If all goes well, at least two others may be ready in 2021.\n",
      "The steps in producing a vaccineVaccine development is a complex and painstaking multi-stage process. It starts with identifying the antigens (parts or weakened strains of a virus) that will be incorporated in the vaccine. Then, tissue-culture or cell-culture and animal testing are done to find out if the vaccine produces immunity.\n",
      "Three stages of clinical testing follow. Phase I entails testing for safety and immunogenicity in normal adults (less than 100 people); phase II entails testing for immunogenicity and safety in special populations (hundreds of human subjects), while phase III, which include thousands of test subjects, continues to measure the safety (rare side effects sometimes don’t appear in small groups) and effectiveness of the candidate vaccine.\n",
      "If the vaccine passes the clinical trials, it is submitted for regulatory review and approval.It is only after it is approved by regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA) is a vaccine manufactured. There are some reasons why vaccine development for Covid has gone faster than usual. For one, researchers did not start from scratch. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a relative of the SARS and MERS viruses, and the work that has already been done on the development of a vaccine for these two infections has been used in the development of the Covid-19 vaccines.Also, some governments, notably the US and UK, have sped up the process by infusing billions of dollars into the vaccine projects.\n",
      "Some research centers meanwhile have accelerated their work by combining phases. Some coronavirus vaccines are now in Phase I and II trials, for example.\n",
      "The frontrunnersCurrently, more than 20 candidate vaccines are in the clinical trial stage, three are already in phase III.\n",
      "The vaccine that the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca are jointly developing has started phase III trials in England, Brazil, and South Africa. The project may deliver a vaccine by October. AstraZeneca said their total manufacturing capacity stands at two billion doses.\n",
      "In China, the state-owned company Sinopharm has reached an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to start phase III testing of its vaccine in the Gulf state. In Australia, the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute is conducting a Phase III trial on the re-purposed Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine to find out if the vaccine partly protects against the coronavirus. The BCG vaccine was developed in the early 1900s as a protection against tuberculosis.\n",
      "Of those in Phase II trials, the American Company, Moderna, will start Phase III testing in July and hopes to have a vaccine ready by early 2021. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Sao Paulo, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in hard-hit Brazil, is one of six states helping to test the so-called CoronaVac vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech.\n",
      "The vaccine produced an immune response in 98 percent of recipients over 60 years old, with no adverse side-effects reported so far, said Governor Joao Doria.“The results have been extremely positive,” he told a news conference.\n",
      "“We will soon be able to immunize Brazilians in Sao Paulo and across the country with the CoronaVac vaccine…. The projected delivery date is in December this year.”\n",

      "The deal gives the institute the right to produce 120 million doses of the vaccine, according to officials.CoronaVac has gotten caught up in a political battle in Brazil, however.\n",
      "President Jair Bolsonaro, whose administration has tense relations with China, has criticized the vaccine, and lashed out at Doria, a leading opponent, for supposedly backing it.\n",
      "The far-right president has instead allocated 1.9 billion reals ($360 million) to purchase another vaccine candidate, developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.Trials of that vaccine, which is also being tested partly in Brazil, were suspended Tuesday after a volunteer recipient developed an unexplained illness — a move the company described as “routine.”\n",

      "Holding clinical trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines will guarantee the country of access to the vaccine once it is proven effective, Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) Executive Director, Dr. Jaime Montoya told House members on Wednesday.\n",
      "But there is a catch.\n",
      "“Hindi po ethical na gumawa ng clinical trial sa isang bansa kung yung bakunang iyon, kapag mapatunayan epektibo, ay hindi naman pala magiging available sa bansang iyon (It’s not ethical to conduct a clinical trial in a country if that vaccine won’t be made available there once it is proven effective),” Montoya said during the Committee on Appropriation’s scrutiny of the proposed P23.8-billion budget of the Department of Science and Technology (DoST) under the 2021 National Expenditure Program (NEP).“So may garantiya po yan, kapag mapatunayang epektibo ‘yung bakuna, kailangang maging available sa bansa (So there’s a guarantee, once the vaccine is proven effective, it must be available in the country),” he said.\n",
      "“Ang tanong lang po dito is, kaagad po ba? Kasi alam natin na sa panahon ng COVID-19, lahat ng bansa ay nag-uunahan na makakuha ng bakuna (The question here is, will we get the vaccine immediately? Because we know that all countries are rushing to get their supply of the vaccine during this time of COVID-19),” Montoya noted.\n",
      "The answer to this question, Montoya said, would largely depend on the government’s negotiation with the foreign vaccine developer, “kung paano po tayo mauuna sa pila (on how we will jump ahead in the queue).”\n",
      "“Pero definitely po magkakaroon po tayo ng access sa bakunang ‘yun (But we will definitely gain access to that vaccine),” he added.The Philippines’ potential role as trial country for potential COVID-19 vaccines is viewed by some as a bargaining chip in terms of assuring supply for the local population, which is estimated at 110 million. This is especially useful for the country, which unlike richer nations can’t make advance payments or pre-orders to vaccine developers.\n",
      "“Would we be able to benefit when it comes to the priority of distribution? Would that be a possible benefit we could negotiate for?” Appropriations panel vice-chairman and Muntinlupa City lone district Rep. Ruffy Biazon asked the attending DoST officials in the mixed live and virtual hearings.\n",
      "Montoya said that perhaps the biggest advantage the Philippine can gain from such clinical trials is knowing whether or not the COVID vaccine is effective in the context of Filipinos’ own genetic make-up, as compared to other nationalities or races.“May sinasabi na genetic variation tungkol sa pag-respond sa vaccine (There is something called genetic variation regarding humans’ response to vaccines),” he underscored.\n",
      "He noted that the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) prefers drugs that have been backed by trials on Filipinos. “Mapapabilis po ang registration ng mga produktong ito para maging available sa karamihan (The registration of this product will be hastened, facilitating its availability).”\n",
      "DoST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña had earlier said in the hearing that the Philippines has had for over 30 years a sterling reputation when it comes to clinical trials for vaccines. “Mahusay po ang ating mga vaccine trialist (Our vaccine trialists are very good).”\n",
      "Regarding the assurance of supply, Dela Peña argued that the Philippines shouldn’t automatically commit to purchasing the first vaccine that would get positive results from a local clinical trial.\n",
      "“‘Yung pag-ensure nila (vaccine developer) ng availability, hindi naman po libre ‘yun. Kailangan may pambili rin tayo. Kaya ito ay dadaan sa procurement process (As for ensuring availability of the vaccine on the part of the vaccine developer, that doesn’t come free. We still need to have the money to buy it. As such this will go through the procurement process),” he said.“Kapag ang bakuna na ito ay OK, yung isang bakuna na iyon ay OK din, hindi naman tayo puwedeng patali…na kami ay bibili sa inyo dahil dito nila ginawa yung trial. Tayo ay magko-compare pa rin sa procurement process (If this vaccine is OK, and that other vaccine is OK, then we can’t commit to buy from them just because the clinical trials were done here. We would still have to compare vaccines during the procurement process),” Dela Peña said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "GENEVA — The World Health Organization (WHO) says it does not expect widespread immunization against COVID-19 until mid-2021, despite growing expectations in the United States, the worst-hit nation, that a vaccine could be released within weeks.\n",
      "The Geneva-based WHO also insisted it would never endorse a vaccine that has not proven safe and effective, amid concerns over the rush to develop a jab for COVID-19.\n",
      "The disease has killed nearly 870,000 people and infected more than 26 million others worldwide as well as upended hundreds of millions of lives and wreaked havoc on the global economy.The UN health agency welcomed the fact that a “considerable number” of vaccine candidates had entered final stage trials, which typically involve tens of thousands of people.\n",
      "But “in terms of realistic timelines, we are really not expecting to see widespread vaccination until the middle of next year,” WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said.\n",
      "‘Trials too small’\n",
      "Russia has already approved a vaccine, and research published in The Lancet medical journal on Friday said patients involved in early tests developed antibodies with “no serious adverse events.”\n",
      "But scientists cautioned the trials were too small – just 76 participants – to prove safety and effectiveness.Washington has also urged US states to get ready for a potential vaccine rollout by November 1, sparking concerns President Donald Trump’s administration is rushing to begin distributing a vaccine ahead of the November 3 election.\n",
      "The United States has suffered the largest number of deaths and infections of any country in the world.\n",
      "Under normal procedures, test administrators must wait for months or years to verify that vaccine candidates are safe and effective.But there has been massive pressure to roll out a vaccine quickly as the pandemic continues to take its toll.\n",

      "All over the world, businesses and individuals are counting the cost of the pandemic, as flare-ups continue to force governments into imposing restrictions.\n",
      "France registered 8,975 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours, its highest daily figure since the pandemic swept into the country last March.\n",
      "The rise comes as Paris and other cities have started requiring face masks in all public areas, including for children above 11 who returned to school this week.\n",
      "The 46th Deauville American film festival in Normandy opened Friday evening with people wearing masks and social distancing. But there were few, if any American movie stars this year.\n",

      "The moment of truth for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) front-runners is coming as soon as this month.\n",
      "(Joe Raedle / Getty Images / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The first results showing whether a vaccine can stop people from getting the virus could come by mid-September from AstraZeneca Plc, according to Airfinity Ltd., an analytics company that tracks drug trials said.\n",
      "The drugmaker has pledged as many as 30 million doses to the UK by the end of the month.Two other contenders – the US’ Moderna, Inc. and the US-German partnership of Pfizer, Inc. and BioNTech SE – may also have initial data before a key Food and Drug Administration meeting on virus vaccines scheduled for Oct. 22, Airfinity said. A fourth, China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd., could have preliminary results shortly after the meeting.\n",
      "Paris-based Sanofi administered the first patients with its experimental COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, bringing it a step closer to the late-stage clinical trials it aims to kick start before year-end.\n",
      "The drugmaker launched human studies at 11 sites across the US. The phase 1/2 trial – which compresses the early and middle stages of clinical tests – will assess 440 healthy patients in two age groups: 18 to 49, and over 50. Sanofi, which is developing the vaccine in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline Plc., aims to have results by December, at which point it hopes to accelerate into late-stage studies.\n",
      "WHO cautions front-runners\n",
      "These early results will be far from the full picture. They’re what’s known as interim readouts – snapshots taken before a study is complete, with only a fraction of the data. The World Health Organization on Monday cautioned against approving a vaccine before its full risks and benefits are clear. But with the virus resurgent in Europe and continuing to spread in India and the Americas, the initial numbers will be an important early indicator.The first results should be enough to “give us a very good idea of where we’re heading,” Airfinity Chief Executive Officer Rasmus Bech Hansen said.\n",
      "“They are moving faster than one could have anticipated.”\n",
      "Airfinity’s projections are based on publicly available data on trial enrollment and design, together with infection rates in places where patients are enrolled.Each of these experimental vaccines has already shown promise in smaller trials designed to flag any serious safety concerns and show whether candidates can spur some response from the immune system.\n",
      "Early safety data is key; unlike drugs, vaccines are typically given to relatively healthy people and shouldn’t create severe risks.\n",
      "The real proving ground, though, is a study big enough to show with a high degree of certainty whether a vaccine candidate can work in the real world. This requires tens of thousands of participants, compared to the few hundred people who took the vaccines in early-stage trials.\n",
      "Drugmakers would usually wait for final results before requesting regulatory approval, and the trio of front-runners are on track to get that full data by the end of the year, Airfinity says. In the US, that might not be fast enough. Overwhelmingly positive interim results could lead to studies being stopped early and the vaccines being rushed to the public, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Los Angeles Times earlier this week.\n",
      "Political picture seen\n",
      "Political pressure will be high to approve a vaccine if even the initial snapshot of data from these trials is promising. President Donald Trump has said a vaccine is possible by the Nov. 3 election and accused the FDA of trying to slow the approval process. Commissioner Stephen Hahn said last week he’s open to clearing a vaccine under an emergency use authorization, which is based on more limited data. Russia and China, meanwhile, have each cleared experimental vaccines for limited use before testing was complete.Pfizer has said it’s on track to have enough data for an authorization as early as October. Based on how quickly and where it’s currently recruiting people for its 30,000-person trial, it will probably be the first US drugmaker with interim data – by Oct. 15 – but won’t have full results until Nov. 17, Airfinity projects. A Pfizer spokeswoman declined to comment on how many virus cases it will need to see in order to get results in the trial.\n",
      "Companies testing vaccines in the US, where the virus has spread more quickly than in Europe for the past several months, may have an advantage in potential volunteers and infections. AstraZeneca said it expects results later this year, depending on the rate of infection in the communities where it’s running trials. J&J said it still plans to start its late-stage trial this month, with first batches of vaccine available for potential emergency use in early 2021, pending the study results. Sinovac declined to comment. Moderna declined to comment on the time-frame for its data readouts.\n",
      "The drugmakers have already made deals to supply hundreds of millions of doses to governments around the world.\n",
      "The WHO has said any vaccine should be shown to be effective in at least half the people who get it to gain clearance. It will be important to follow participants in the trials long enough to see whether serious side effects emerge, WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Monday. A premature approval would make it hard to continue studying the vaccine in randomized trials, she said. The agency counts 176 COVID19 vaccines in development, of which 33 have entered human trials.\n",
      "“What’s going to be really important, I think, is to make decisions based on science,” Swaminathan said, warning that an “inadequately studied” vaccine could present either safety problems or “low efficacy, thereby not doing the job of bringing an end to this pandemic.”\n",
      "175 COVID-19 vaccine candidates\n",
      "Though Sanofi and Glaxo are just now starting their latest trial, the vaccine front-runners may deliver interim data from their late-stage studies as early as this month. There are more than 175 COVID-19 vaccines currently in development, according to the World Health Organization, and 33 in human trials. A handful have ambitions to secure emergency use authorizations in the fall.\n",
      "“I’m not concerned that we’re a few months behind some of the other vaccine candidates,” John Shiver, senior vice president of global vaccine research and development, said in an interview. Sanofi’s expertise in conducting trials and “experience with very similar viruses” will allow it to gain back time on its peers, he said, and ultimately, multiple shots will be needed.\n",
      "The vaccine candidate relies on technology Sanofi uses to make influenza shots and Glaxo’s adjuvants, which enhance the body’s immune response. Sanofi also has a messenger RNA vaccine in development. Shiver said both candidates reported “compelling” data in pre-clinical studies.\n",
      "“They showed very, very high levels of neutralizing antibodies in monkeys that are comparable to levels in humans who recovered from the Covid-19 infection,” Shiver said of the pre-clinical studies, which are to be published in medical journals later this year. That data gave Sanofi confidence as it moves to the next stage, he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "(Joe Raedle / Getty Images / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Haresco, during the House Committee on Health hearing, asked the Department of Health (DoH) regarding the possibility of placing vaccine pre-orders from major pharmaceutical companies outside of China and Russia.\n",
      "“Most advanced countries like the US (United States) and the UK (United Kingdom) have already pre-ordered or put a downpayment on the six leading vaccines, among which (are from companies) Astrazeneca, Pfizer, and Modern,” Haresco said during the virtual hearing.“What is the policy of the DoH and the PITC (Philippine International Trading Corp.) in pre-ordering kasi (because) Mr. Chair, if the vaccines more or less pass through Phase 3 and 4 trials by November, baka maiwanan tayo sa pansitan (we would be left behind in procurement),” he said.\n",
      "“Kahit mag-downpayment lang tayo ng singko sentimos, at least naka-(pila) tayo (If we could just make a misniscule down payment, at least we’d join the queue),” noted the House Committee on Appropriations vice chairman.\n",
      "Haresco cited pronouncements from US President Donald Trump that America won’t be sharing its advanced order of some 600 million doses of the vaccine. The solon said UK and Germany are also inclined to keep their supply of the antigen to themselves.\n",
      "“The only countries willing to share are China and Russia.These vaccines from Russia and China, according to global press, are somewhat not in depth,” he said.Director Crispinita Valdez of the DoH Procurement Service said a host of other government agencies are involved in the procurement talks and coordination with the manufacturers of these vaccines.\n",
      "“There is a committee tackling the vaccines it is headed by DoST (Department of Science and Technology). There is also a committee contacting the manufacturers. The DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) is also helping in the coordination,” she told the Health panel.\n",
      "“With regard pre-payment I’m not sure about that but there is an effort to actually coordinate with manufacturers. The committee is composed of DoH, DTI (Department of Trade and Industry), DoST, and other agencies,” Valdez added.Haresco said: “I fear the words ‘coordinating’ and ‘committee,’ kasi baka walang mangyari diyan (because nothing might come out of it).”\n",
      "The House committee was discussing House Bill (HB) No.6995, or the “An Act Providing for the Stockpiling of Strategic and Critical Drugs and Medicines, Vaccines, Devices, and Materials for Public Health Emergencies, Creating for the Purpose the Health Procurement and Stockpiling Bureau under the DoH.” Panel chairperson Quezon Rep. Angelina Tan penned the bill.\n",
      "“Baka puwede nating mailagay sa bill na (Maybe we could have the bill say that) a competent agency will be responsible for the pre-order…para hindi magturuan ang DFA, DoST, at DoH (so as to avoid finger-pointing among the DFA, DoST, and DoH),” Haresco said.\n",
      "Tan found some merit in Haresco’s corcerns about a possible delay in the procurement of the much-anticipated COVID vaccine.\n",
      "“We do have foreign-funded programs and projects for support or aid na sa PITC, PBSP nagla-lodge ‘yung money (wherein the money was lodged with the PITC, PBSP). It took time. Kasi kung sa DoH ‘yan, ang ginagawa nila ipinapasa nila dito sa third party na ito (if it’s up the DoH, they would just pass it on to a third-party entity),” she said.“‘Yun ‘yung current problem natin kung dumating ‘yung vaccine natin in the future for COVID-19. Baka na-anticipate talaga natin na magka-problema tayo sa procurement (That’s the current problem once the COVID-19 vaccine arrives. We’ve anticipated that we’ll encounter problems with procurement),” added Tan.\n",

      "The Department of Health (DOH) said that clinical trials for candidate vaccines for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has yet to begin as the Philippines is still in negotiations with other countries.\n",
      "Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario S. Vergeire\n",
      "(PCOO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the country’s vaccine experts panel is still in talks with different COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers.\n",
      "“Ito pong ating mga ginagawa palang ay mga [We are still in] negotiations with the different manufacturers and also with the other governments who have committed to help the Philippines,” Said Vergeire.Vergeire said that the Philippines’ experts panel is still reviewing the results of the initial clinical trial phase of the Sputnik V vaccine from Russia.\n",
      "“Last week we have requested already the Phase I and Phase II details coming from Gamaleya Institute–yung Russian na vaccine para lang mapag-aralan ng vaccine experts panel [Last week we have already requested the Phase I and Phase II details coming from Gamaleya Institute – the Russian vaccine —in order for the vaccine experts panel to study it],” she said.\n",

      "Gene sequencing\n",
      "In a related development, Vergeire said the public should exercise caution in interpreting the recent findings of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) on the identified lineages of COVID-19 strain in the country.\n",
      "“Yung pag aaral ng RITM kailangan cautious din ang interpretation natin dyan. Yung napag-aralan ng RITM maliit na proportion pa lang ng population and it was done in hindi ganun kadaming places [We need to be cautious in our interpretation in the RITM’s study. The coverage of the RITM study was just a small proportion of the population],” said Vergeire.\n",
      "In the study, the RITM has identified five lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Philippines. These lineages are named as A, B, B.1, B.1.1, and B.6.\n",
      "The RITM said that lineages A and B were the original strains from China. Lineages B.1 and B.1.1 are associated with the outbreaks in Italy and other European countries. Meanwhile, Lineage B.6 was detected in India, United Kingdom, North America, Australia, and Singapore.The RITM noted that the first three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines belong to the Lineage A and B. The three individuals are travelers from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak first emerged.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the samples collected in the National Capital Region (NCR), Ilocos Sur, Rizal and Laguna in March, including samples from the first two reported cases of local transmission, belong to Lineage B.6. Moreover, the samples collected last June in NCR and Laguna belong to Lineage B1 and B.1.1.\n",
      "The RITM noted that the “viral genomes that have been sequenced,” together with the Philippine Genome Center “represent a very small picture of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the country.”\n",
      "“The sequencing results, however, suggest that from January to July 2020, there were multiple introductions of different SARS-CoV-2 lineages and strains in the country,” it said.\n",
      "Vergeire said that further study is needed to determine the origin of the COVID-19 spread in the country.\n",
      "“We need more details, we need more data, we need to further the study so that we can accurately say na talagang hindi yung mga Chinese ang nagspread at nagkaroon tayo ng iba pang pinanggalingan nung mga sources of infection natin [that it was really not the Chinese [travelers] who spread [the infection] and that we had other sources of infection],” said Vergeire.

      "The Philippines is trying to secure access to a vaccine in development against Covid-19 as it battles the worst outbreak in Southeast Asia.\n",
      "But though other regional countries like Indonesia have already inked deals with frontrunner vaccine candidates, the archipelago’s lack of capacity to locally manufacture vaccines has disadvantaged its bid.\n",
      "“We are the last in the line because we can’t develop our own vaccines,” the Philippines’ former health chief Esperanza Cabral said. “If we had the capability to make vaccines, we would come first.”The country is banking on a vaccine to contain its surging outbreak that has infected over 197,000 people after testing gaffes and poor tracing rendered one of the world’s longest lockdowns ineffective. President Rodrigo Duterte has begun easing restrictions despite cases doubling this month to rescue the local economy that’s heading for its deepest slump since 1985. The Philippines will test 14 vaccines for clinical trials helmed by the World Health Organization, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told a local news channel on Monday. Moscow’s Sputnik V vaccine is expected to start mass scale Phase 3 trials in the Philippines in October.\n",
      "Negotiations are also on with 16 makers of potential Covid-19 vaccines to procure supplies. The government intends to stock up shots worth $400 million and is in talks with the U.S., U.K., and China for supplies.\n",
      "Regional competition, meanwhile, is heating up. A state-owned drugmaker in Indonesia is gearing up for human trials of Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s coronavirus vaccine while Singapore and Thailand are developing their own candidates. Malaysia has picked local drugmakers for packaging and distribution of vaccine doses when available.\n",
      "Local manufacturing is still a possibility, according to Vergeire. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Manila has applied for an Asian Development Bank grant to study the feasibility of setting up a vaccine facility.In the meantime, the government could also partner with the private sector to fund a modular vaccine packaging facility to get its foot in the door of the global vaccine supply chain, she said. “Vaccine security will be a challenge. You cannot ensure that even if you have the money, you can get the vaccine you need,” said Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination. “The whole world is going to try to get the vaccine for itself.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

(Photo by Handout / Russian Direct Investment Fund / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Using two methods of public opinion research, WR Numero Research sought to identify the opinions of Filipinos regarding Russia’s coronavirus vaccine and the administration’s move to participate in its trials despite suspicion from experts of the vaccine’s safety.\n",
      "The survey, conducted from Aug. 13 to 15 among 11,561 respondents, also found out that four out of 10 Filipinos are unsure about the Russian COVID-19 vaccine. Half agree to be vaccinated once a COVID-19 vaccine has been approved and is available.WR Numero Research said that 42 percent are unsure whether they want to be vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine from Russia. More than half disagree about the use of Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines due to lack of World Health Organization approval. Five out of 10 think the Russian vaccine is still unsafe to use as it has not yet accomplished Phase 3 of clinical trial research.\n",
      "Meanwhile, WR Numero Research’s Digital Sentiment generated through its unique proprietary digital listening and sentiment analysis tool called Pathos garnered 1,646,655 engagements on Facebook from Aug. 11 to 19 and found out that 23 percent doubt safety and efficacy of Russia’s coronavirus vaccine.\n",
      "It also found that 14 percent support President Duterte participating in trial of the Russian vaccine; 11 percent want administration supporters and public officials to participate in the trial as well; 11 percent condemn the idea of Filipinos being lab rats; eight percent support Russia and hopeful about the vaccine; seven percent demand Russia to conduct vaccine trial to its own people; and six percent said they trust Russia’s vaccine than China’s.\n",
      "On the other hand, six percent are alarmed that a similar Dengvaxia controversy will happen; five percent criticize those who complain about the vaccine; three percent said Duterte volunteering for trial is another case of “jet ski promise” to defend the West Philippine Sea; and two percent criticized Duterte and question his unsubstantiated health claims.The survey utilized a non-probability sampling, specifically convenience sampling of users willing to participate. The data was generated through survey questions on a mobile application that users from their data partner’s online community answer.\n",
      "Of the respondents, 34 percent are 18 to 25-years-old, 41 percent are 26- to 35-years- old, 20 percent are 36- to 50-years-old, and five percent are 50-years-old and above.\n",

      "Filipinos were among the thousands who volunteered in the Phase III trials of a potential COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Philippine Embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Sunday.Philippine Ambassador to the UAE Hjayceelyn Quintana commended the hundreds of Filipino nurses and volunteers who took part in the potential COVID-19 vaccine trials, during her recent visit at the Group 42 (G42) healthcare station located at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC).During the visit, Group 42 Chief Research Officer Dr. Waleed Zaher gave Quintana a walk-through of the trial process, from registration down to the actual vaccination.The ADNEC trial site is touted to be the biggest of its kind in the world. Since July 16, 2020, the potential vaccine has been administered to over 15,000 people of various nationalities, including Filipino volunteers.UAE-based Filipino journalist Neil Bie, one of the first Filipinos to volunteer in the trial, said his motivation in joining was to express his gratitude to the UAE government for caring for all foreign residents during the pandemic the same way it treats its own citizens.\n",
      "At the facility, Dr. Zaher introduced Quintana to the Filipino nurses working at the site and expressed UAE’s appreciation for the role they play in the mission.G42 has 181 Filipino frontliners (180 nurses and one doctor) involved in the COVID-19 vaccine trials.Quintana said she was very proud of the Filipino frontliners and volunteers at the facility even as she thanked them for their involvement in the COVID-19 vaccine trial that will benefit humanity as a whole.“There is a core Filipino value called “pakikipagkapwa” which can be roughly described as ‘one’s care for his or her fellow human being.’ The dedication given by Filipinos involved in the vaccine trial springs forth from this Filipino value,” Quintana said.Filipino nurse Rogelio Buezon Jr. expressed elation over the visit of the Filipino envoy, saying, “This is a great way to send a message of hope that the Philippine government values the efforts of frontliners like us, especially during these times.”The UAE is among the first countries conducting a Phase III Trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine that is developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical company, Sinopharm.

      "As various countries are in pursuit of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, the Philippines is still a long way from achieving self-sufficiency in developing vaccines.\n",
      "(PIXABAY / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Dr. Jaime Montoya, Executive Director of the Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), said that vaccine development and production requires huge investments and resources.\n",
      "“Most companies will tell you that they actually factor in the cost of R&D, from proof of concept to marketing. All of that has to be dealt (with) into the final cost of the product. So, we imagine for this COVID-19 pandemic vaccine…it would really be expensive,” Dr. Montoya said during a virtual press briefing of the Sub-Technical Working Group (TWG) on Vaccine Development.In a factory line of vaccine production, said Dr. Montoya, it starts from the concept to the final product that is actually distributed to the people who will use it. Starting from the proof of concept, there will be a need for a group of scientists.\n",
      "After going through the proof of concept, the vaccine needs to be tested and subjected to the clinical trials. The next phase is to have the product registered with the regulatory agencies. Dr. Montoya said that product registration depends on how good are the results of the clinical trials. Upon approval of product registration, the vaccine will be made available to the public.\n",
      "“So, that is the whole value chain and when it leaves the production line, it has to end up with the eventual user…So, how to make it intact and viable until it reaches its eventual customers, it is very important. So, we should actually have a clear idea of the whole value chain…and that is taken into consideration for the development of a vaccine and may be to some extent to how much a vaccine would cost,” Dr. Montoya said.\n",
      "Dr. Montoya explained that the country still has a lot of things to do, upgrade and enhance in order to attain a certain degree of ability to manufacture vaccines. He said that Research and Development (R&D) for vaccine development would require significant scientific talent development involving several disciplines, planning, infrastructure, capacity building for the state of the art laboratory facilities and training of sufficient human resources.\n",
      "“As far as I know, we also have to upgrade our whole value chain as far as vaccine availability is concerned,” he added.\n",
      "Dr. Montoya further stated that we really have to do a lot of development. He assured that the government is already doing a lot of negotiations, discussions and plans in order to achieve some degree of vaccine self-sufficiency, to be capable to respond to the pandemic such as what is being experienced now.\n",
      "DOST Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara, Chair of the sub-Technical Working Group (TWG) on Vaccine Development said that while currently the country does not have the research facility to undertake the research in developing a vaccine, the DOST has been working on establishing a Virology Science and Technology Institute of the Philippines.“We already got funding for the R&D starting next year. This will not just deal with the human viruses but also with viruses against animals and plants,” she said.\n",
      "“We are just starting, but we are very fortunate that we have started developing the human resource since 2007 so we have the MS and the PHDs in all the right fields, and we have the MD PHDs who will help us undertake and develop vaccines for future pandemics but for now, we don’t have it,” she added.

      "In a statement, the health department said they made this recommendation while in discussions with the Health Technology Assessment Council, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Philippine Medical Association (PMA).\n",

      "As the world races to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday (Aug. 21) has yet to receive any application for clinical trials in the Philippines, said FDA-Center for Drug Regulation and Research director Dr. Jesusa Cirunay in an online forum.\n",

      "Under normal circumstances, it takes 45 to 60 days to approve an application for a clinical trial, while the approval of the fourth and last stage of the clinical trials takes 70 to 90 days.\n",

      "Zamboanga Sibugay 1st district Rep. Wilter “Sharky” Wee Palma II\n",
      "In an interview Thursday night, Palma said the proposal, which was retained in the Bicameral Conference Committee report on the “Bayanihan to Recover as One” bill, simply intends to help the Philippines get ahead in the long queue of countries that would want to buy the vaccine once it is out in the market.\n",
      "“Ang ginawa na lang namin (What we said in the bill) is, we will waive the Phase 4 requirement insofar as procurement (is concerned). Let me repeat, procurement only,” said the solon, who was part of the House of Representatives contingent in the just-concluded bicameral meetings with senators on the so-called “Bayanihan 2” stimulus package.“Otherwise, baka maunahan tayo sa pagbili (others will purchase ahead of us). Once it is open in the market, dapat nakapila na tayo (we should be in queue). We should have signified our intent to buy already,” he said.\n",

      "Millions, or even billions worth of dosages of the COVID-19 vaccine are expected to be ordered from all points of the globe. In other words, there’s a real possibility that some nations will get wait-listed for their supply of the vaccine.\n",
      "Phase 4 of the vaccine development process refers to the completion of the post-marketing surveillance of the medicine. “Medyo magtatagal talaga if we will follow Phase 4 (Following Phase 4 will really take time),” Palma said.Citing the example of vaccine frontrunner Russia, Palma said its antigen candidate needs to meet three requirements in order to satisfy the procurement provision for drugs and vaccines in Bayanihan 2.\n",
      "He said the Russia vaccine must 1) get approved by its Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-equivalent agency, 2) get approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), and, 3) gain international recognition. “Yun lang ang requirement natin (Those are our only requirement).”\n",
      "After that, the Philippines may begin to procure (purchase) or accept donations of the vaccine.“Afterwards, we will encourage also the pharmaceutical companies that we have to conduct their own personal research and development, and even standards for the distribution in cooperation with our FDA and HTAC (Health Technology Assessment Center),” the Mindanaoan solon said.\n",
      "The bicameral meetings on the P165-billion Bayanihan 2 took four days to complete. The Senate ratified the resulting report from the meetings on Thursday night.\n",

      "“You don’t want to mandate and try and force anyone to take a vaccine. We’ve never done that,” said Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, during a video talk organized by George Washington University.\n",
      "“You can mandate for certain groups of people like health workers, but for the general population you can’t” he added, citing the example of the National Institutes of Health, where health workers can’t treat patients without a flu shot.Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison hours earlier announced that coronavirus vaccines, once approved, would be mandatory for everyone in his country, barring medical exemptions.\n",
      "But the United States’ decentralized system of government, and anti-vaccine sentiments that have been building for decades, had in any case made a program of mandatory immunization unlikely.\n",

      "Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Tuesday admitted he is hesitant to endorse plans for the Philippines to participate in a COVID-19 vaccination plan that did not undergo Phase 4 clinical trial.\n",
      "Health Secretary Francisco Duque III (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Duque said the fourth phase in vaccine development is critical as this is the completion of the post marketing surveillance and is meant to ensure that a novel vaccine is safe and efficient for use of thousands and millions of people.\n",
      "“Just to ensure that this, being a new vaccine, the Universal Health Care law requires that this is undertaken to ensure the safety of the product, as we all know, that any new product has some heightened risks. And so, critical trial phase 4 is really meant to protect (people),” Duque said responding to Senate minority leader Franklin Drilon’s question during the Senate inquiry on Philippine Health Insurance Corp. or PhilHealth.Asked by Drilon if he would endorse moves to dispense with a Phase 4 of clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines, Duque said he would not, considering it is a novel vaccine and the situation is evolving.\n",
      "“It’s very difficult to answer but…no, no sir, knowing what I know,” Duque said.\n",
      "However, Sen. Pia Cayetano pointed out it is imperative that the Department of Health (DOH) soon decide on the matter since Congress is finalizing the Bayanihan to Recover As One Act or “Bayanihan 2.”\n",
      "“If the phraseology in the Bayanihan (2) Law would be such that, if WHO (World Health Organization) and other countries with recognized and mature FDAs(Food and Drug Administration) would approve the waiving of a Stage 4. Would that seem acceptable to you?” Cayetano asked.“If WHO endorses, or these countries with mature FDAs – and I understand mature FDAs include the US, UK, and Russia din pala – so if they would allow and they are okay with doing away with that, are you prepared to endorse it or do you even have to consult other experts? Hindi po kayo epidemiologist, hindi po kayo microbiologist, so do you need time to consult? Because this is very important to us,” she stressed.\n",
      "To which Duque replied: “I will consult the experts, your honor. But having said that, one of the guiding principles in our pandemic response is that science should be the basis of whatever decision we make, whether to wait for Phase IV or to… We have to be open to the experts, but we have groups of experts as well, some opposing each other, some very divided, but some have very strong consensus.”\n",
      "“Makikipag-usap po kami (we will consult with them). How much time can we be given, your honor?” Duque asked.Cayetano responded that the bicameral conference committee is hoping to wrap up the final version of the Bayanihan 2 on Wednesday. “I think our deadline is tomorrow. But this is a crucial issue,” she said.\n",
      "She said she fears that the Philippines could be left behind if other countries decided to waive Phase 4 of the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine while the government decides to wait for the final stage before approving it.\n",
      "Among the vaccines being considered by the government are Moderna from the United States, Sputnik V from Russia and one from China.\n",
      "“Natatakot lang po ako, kasi nami-misquote tayo sa mga napakahalagang issue na ganito (I am afraid because we are usually misquoted over important issues like this). For the record, the reason there is a provision like that in the draft is precisely because we wanted to ensure that if WHO and countries with mature FDAs like the US are already using the vaccines, and they have decided to waive stage 4, then hindi naman pwedeng tayo lang ang nakatali, yung buong mundo, nag-vaccine na (we can’t afford to be tied on this, while the rest of the world have already been vaccinated),” she pointed out.\n",
      "On the other hand, Cayetano said she does not “believe in legislating science.” Congress, however, is in a rush to approve the Bayanihan 2, which aims to boost the country’s COVID-19 efforts and revive the Philippine economy battered after the series of lockdowns imposed to contain the spread of the disease.“That’s why we are asking these questions. Because precisely, we want to craft the wording such that we are basing decisions on science. For the record because it is very important that our country’s confidence in vaccination is preserved,” she said.\n",
      "“Because we already went through a trauma on vaccinations with Dengvaxia. Our country cannot afford another trauma. We cannot afford millions of infants not being vaccinated for measles, for chickenpox, for smallpox, for the polio drops, because of erroneous decisions on this, Mr. President,” Cayetano pointed out.\n",
      "Sen. Francis Tolentino, meanwhile, expressed his disappointment at Duque for “dilly-dallying” on crafting a clear roadmap for a COVID-19 vaccine acquisition.\n",
      "“Let me remind you Mr. Secretary that your dilly-dallying and semblance of evasion in answering the question is probably reflective of your non-bravery being the field marshall of this pandemic war,” Tolentino retorted during the hearing. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "It’s one of the longest words in the English language and it may mean something so wonderful and extremely good. Being so, one may relate it to the awaited coronavirus vaccine being developed — the long road towards something so extraordinarily beneficial to mankind now virtually paralyzed by the pandemic.I had an enlightening talk in my Teleradyo program last Sunday with former Health Secretary Esperanza Cabral who described the arduous process in the frantic search around the world for a safe and effective vaccine which many hope would be the magic bullet to defeat COVID-19 and bring forth economic recovery.\n",
      "While many vaccines for other illnesses took 10 to 15 years to develop, with the fastest at 4 years (for mumps), the world’s scientists and the entire pharmaceutical industry are now racing to develop within a year’s time the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n",
      "It’s possible to come up with such vaccine in less than a year, Dr. Cabral said, using a mix of new technologies and experience. Indeed, many reports point out massive efforts of research scientists have been “accelerated considerably by acquired knowledge developed during the generation of candidate vaccines for related SARS and MERS coronaviruses, as well as recent research into Ebola vaccines.”\n",
      "Still, despite the urgent need to come up soonest with a product that protects against COVID-19 and its transmission, a vaccine must go through multiple stages — consisting of initial research and development, followed by a series of pre-clinical and clinical trials — before being approved for use by the general population.The pre-clinical trial stage is when the vaccine is administered to animals to see if an immune response is triggered and to see how safe it is. But there are reports that for some coronavirus vaccines, “researchers have been able to speed up normal protocol by testing animals and humans in parallel.”\n",
      "Dr. Cabral described the clinical trials which consist of three phases. In the first phase, the vaccine is given to a small group of volunteers, usually from 10 to 50 people. The second phase covers several hundred people, while the third and last stage consists of thousands or even tens of thousands of various ages in various locations.\n",
      "All three phases are administered to determine the vaccine’s potential side-effects, immune response, dosage required, and to further gauge its safety, of course.The US biotechnology firm Moderna was first in the world to start human trials last March 16, according to a CNN report last week. “Now there are six vaccines in the last stage of human trials (Phase 3) before they seek approval: Three from China — two developed by state-owned Sinopharm and one from private Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech; one from the United Kingdom produced in partnership between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca; and two from the US, one by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, in addition to the candidate by Moderna,” the report said.\n",
      "But the first country to declare it had registered a vaccine and approved it for use is Russia, with President Vladimir Putin saying that one of his daughters had been inoculated. He said the vaccine, called “Sputnik V” after the Soviet-era satellite that was first launched into space, “works quite effectively, forms strong immunity… and has passed all the needed checks.”\n",
      "However, the vaccine’s development process has raised concerns because, apart from being approved in Russia without undergoing the Phase 3 trial, no data on Phase 1 and 2 trials conducted by the state-run Gamaleya Research Institute have been subjected to peer review.\n",
      "The Philippines will join Russia’s Phase 3 trial to be conducted from October, 2020, to March next year, according to Dr. Jaime Montoya, executive director of Department of Science and Technology Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), who said around a thousand healthy Filipinos from areas with high COVID-19 transmission will be selected.\n",

      "Russia’s discovery of a COVID-19 vaccine seems to provide light at the end of the pandemic tunnel.President Vladimir Putin has announced that the Russian-developed vaccine offers “sustainable immunity” against the coronavirus. He revealed that it was even administered on his daughter and the results are positive.\n",
      "The vaccine, developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, is dubbed “Sputnik V,” in honor of Sputnik 1, the world’s first ever satellite launched by the USSR in 1957.\n",
      "We also welcome and deeply appreciate Russia’s gesture that it will supply our country with the vaccines, as announced by President Duterte and by our good friend Russian Ambassador to Manila Igor Khovaev.\n",
      "Russia’s “feat” as the first country in the world to launch a COVID-19vaccine has not escaped critics, which is expected. We humbly suggest, however, that instead of sowing cynicism and intrigue, the international community should commend and support Russia in this endeavor. After all, Russia’s scientific accomplishment is good for humanity, for the world.It is easier said than done, but we also believe that when it comes to combating this raging pandemic, which has been claiming lives, shattering businesses and livelihoods, and devastating economies, countries must temporarily set aside their differences. It has been repeatedly pointed out that international solidarity and cooperation are needed to win the war against this deadly plague.\n",
      "We do not think that Russia, or any other country, will unveil a much-needed and -anticipated vaccine that is not safe and effective. Doing so would be foolish, to say the least.\n",
      "Currently, there are reportedly hundreds of COVID-19 vaccines that are being developed worldwide, six of which are in the final stage of clinical trials. The first three have been developed by Chinese scientists and the three others by the British-Swedish companies Oxford-AstraZeneca, the German firms Pfizer Inc-BioNtech, and the American company Moderna.\n",

      "(AFP/Angela Weiss)Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber was lauded for his dedication to save the theater industry by pledging to take part in an ongoing Covid-19 vaccine trial being developed by Oxford University and drug company, AstraZeneca.\n",
      "A day after, the renowned composer and musical theater impresario announced on Twitter that he had completed the mission, along with a photo attachment of himself being propped up by a medical worker for his injection. “Just completed the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trial. I’ll do anything to get theaters large and small open again, and actors and musicians back to work,” the caption said.Webber’s involvement with an experimental immunization is just a part of his attempts to revive the theater stage. He vows to reopen London’s The Phantom of the Opera as soon as possible on behalf of the ensemble and producers, including Cameron Mackintosh, who admitted the show is currently facing a huge financial hit that could snowball into a permanent shutdown. Webber has also created a video series on Youtube called “Composer in Isolation,” where he takes suggestions from his fans and proceeds to play the most requested song off his vast catalog. He also squeezes in a few “Stories Behind the Scores” videos to share a detailed account of his compositions. “Composer in Isolation”\n",
      "Since March, he has been very vocal about his ambition to keep the theater industry running and to bring back the confidence of the audience during the crisis, in spite of “cultural catastrophe” and the widely criticized U.K. government’s weak response for the arts.Webber has composed scores for several famous musicals, including Phantom of the Opera, Cats, and Sunset Boulevard. He was recognized as “the most commercially successful composer in history” by the New York Times. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

We need to understand that different vaccines give different effects to different ethnic groups and that is evidence-based, that the effects of these vaccines may be different from that of a population, race, or ethnic group],” she said.“Tulad ng Moderna, hindi man nila gawin ang clinical trials sakali sa ibang bansa, pero tayo assured kasi yung Filipino-Americans ata isasali sa Phase 3 clinical trials nila doon. So makikita natin yung effect ng bakuna sa race natin. May ganyang details or technical intricacies ang mga bakuna.

      "CAVITE – Two pharmaceutical companies from the United Kingdom and the United States will conduct a field trial for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine in the province, Governor Jonvic Remulla announced on Thursday (Aug. 13).\n",
      "“Ang Cavite ay malapit na sumailalim sa Phase 3 field trial ng dalawang kilalang pharmaceutical giant. Kasama sa pag-aaral ay ang mahigit sa 10,000 volunteer recipients ng experimental vaccine (Cavite will soon be under the Phase 3 field trial of two known pharmaceutical giants. The study involves over 10,000 volunteer recipients of the experimental vaccine),” Remulla wrote on his Facebook page.\n",
      "Under the field trial, 5,000 volunteers will get the vaccine while the other 5,000 will get placebo medication as part of the standard protocol.“Ito din ay bahagi sa 100,000 sample size na parte ng pangatlong level ng pagsusuri sa epekto ng bakuna (This is also part of the 100,000-sample size which is part of the third level of trials to see the vaccine’s effectivity),” the governor added. “This will undergo intense scrutiny with the scientific community to determine its validity and efficacy. Only then will the vaccine be made available to the public.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, Remulla expressed his concern over the news of Russia launching a COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "“I have nothing against the Russians nor am I connected to any preferred country or vaccine manufacturer. I do NOT stand to gain on this but forgive me if my primary interest is to safeguard the health and safety of my constituents in Cavite. As far as I know, the Russian data is UNAVAILABLE; their methodology is NOT open; and its efficacy has not been subject to a review and analysis,” the governor wrote.\n",
      "Remulla appealed to the Department of Health (DOH) to “safeguard the process of review, approval, and appropriation of the COVID-19 vaccine.”According to data compiled by the Cavite Provincial Information and Community Affairs Department (PICAD), the province has recorded 2,370 cases as of August 11.

      "Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri on Wednesday urged the government to be cautious in its planned purchase of COVID-19 vaccines from abroad.\n",
      "Sen. Juan Miguel Zubiri (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Zubiri said the Philippines should get the coronavirus vaccines from “reputable sources” to avoid the repeat of the Dengvaxia controversy.\n",
      "“We have to make sure our FDA (Food and Drug Administration) officials will make certain that the vaccines na bibilhin po natin at ipapamigay po natin sa ating mga kababayan ay mga matitinong bakuna hindi tulad ng nangyari sa Dengvaxia (that the vaccines we will purchase and distribute to our people are safe and will not end up like Dengvaxia),” he said in an online interview with reporters.“We don’t want to have another Dengvaxia scandal on our hands,” he added.\n",
      "Several officials from the Department of Health (DOH), its attached agencies, and French drug manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur were charged over the government’s dengue immunization program for schoolchildren in 2016.Dengvaxia, the anti-dengue vaccine used in the program, was criticized for putting at risk individuals who have not yet had dengue and were immunized. Hundreds of children’s deaths were also blamed on the vaccine.\n",
      "“Kailangan mag-ingat po tayo (We should be careful).Let’ s continue with the testing, let’s follow science, let’s follow the reports given by the WHO (World Health Organization) about the efficacy of these vaccines bago tayo (before we) mag-hook, line and sinker, magpaturok po tayo ng bakuna (get injected with the COVID-19 vaccine). Hindi po natin alam baka mapasama pa sa atin (We might not know that these could put us in more danger),” Zubiri said.“We want to make sure vaccines that we get are very good, ‘yong talagang high level of resistance ang nabibigay niya (that it will give a really high level of resistance),” said the senator, who is also a COVID-19 survivor.President Duterte had recently accepted an offer from Russia to supply potential coronavirus vaccines to the Philippines. He also volunteered to take the first shot of the vaccine reportedly called “Sputnik V”.\n",
      "Some scientists, however, were skeptical about Russia’s claim that its vaccine is ready for use, citing the need for more trials to determine if it is safe and effective.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said the government “must act on the basis or our national interest” regarding its purchase of COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "“We are being asked to participate in the testing. I would rely on the judgment of our health authorities to hand this request. What is important is we must have access to this vaccine once it is tested and accepted in the market. It is essential for the health of our people,” Drilon said in a separate virtual briefing.\n",
      "Zubiri said that in including funds for the purchase of vaccines under the proposed Bayanihan 2 law, he said he will propose a provision that would mandate the government to buy vaccines not only from one country, but should be sourced out from different countries.

      "According to Lim, each employee can also nominate one member of their family to receive vaccination as well. “Our employees’ families are as important as they are to us. We want them to be protected, too.”MMDA General Manager Jose Arturo Garcia, meanwhile, stressed the importance of getting vaccinated against the coronavirus.\n",
      "“Vaccination can stop the spread of the virus. COVID-19 spreads from one person to another, but when a person is vaccinated, he is protected from the virus. COVID-19 vaccines can help boost our personnel’s immune system, thus decreasing their risk from getting the virus,”Garcia said.\n",

      "Zubiri said he supports the allocation of more funds for the government’s forthcoming vaccination program to put an end to the coronavirus epidemic.\n",
      "He said lawmakers from both houses of Congress are set to discuss tomorrow, August 13, in pre-bicameral conference committee meeting the provisions of the proposed “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act”.“I think part of the funds will be utilized for Bayanihan 2 will be set aside —this was of course unofficially mentioned within our chat groups— for purchases of vaccines, para hindi na po tayo kailangan maghintay pa ng (so we will no longer have to wait for the) budget for 2021,” Zubiri bared.\n",
      "“Dahil napakarami nang (because there are a lot of) vaccines that are starting to come out in the market…Ang ayaw natin mangyari mahuli tayo sa pagbili ng vaccines (We don’t want to be late in purchasing vaccines),” he added.\n",
      "The Senate’s version of the bill provides a P140-billion standby fund to support programs responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, proposed a P162-billion allocation.\n",
      "The Department of Finance (DOF) earlier said it could only commit some P140 billion due to the government’s depleting funds for this year.“We are looking into the budget kasi napaka-meager ng amount, ‘di ba, P140 billion, napakaraming industriyang humihingi ng tulong. Pero siyempre bibigyan natin ng halaga ang pagbili ng bakuna kung gusto nating bumalik sa normal (But of course we will have to prioritize the procurement of vaccines if we wanted to return to normal),” he said.“By doing that, we will have to get the budget of the other industries that need help,” he continued.\n",
      "Zubiri said he will also appeal to the DOF and the DOH for the increase of the budget for vaccines so that industries that are badly affected by the pandemic could also slowly recover.\n",
      "“I’m sure papayag naman po si Secretary [Carlos] Dominguez kung magdagdag tayo ng P3 billion. Gawin nating P5 billion for vaccines, initially,” he said.The Department of Health (DOH) had initially set aside P2.4 billion for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines under its proposed 2021 budget.

      "“The first registration has taken place,” Putin said Tuesday at a televised government meeting, adding that one of his daughters has already been given the vaccine. “I hope that we can soon begin mass production.”\n",
      "The move clears the way for widespread use of the vaccine, named Sputnik V, among Russia’s population, with production starting next month, although it may take until January to complete trials.Medical workers could begin receiving the drug by the end of the month, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said at the meeting.\n",
      "The announcement represents a propaganda coup for the Kremlin amid a global race to develop vaccines against the coronavirus pandemic and accusations that Russian hackers sought to steal international drug research.\n",
      "The disease has killed nearly 750,000 people, infected more than 20 million and crippled national economies.\n",

      "Yet the speed with which the vaccine has received regulatory approval has drawn criticism, with a local association of multinational pharmaceutical companies calling the rushed registration dangerous.“This is a political decision by Putin so he can claim that Russia was the first in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine,” said Svetlana Zavidova, executive director of Russia’s Association of Clinical Trials Organizations. “I can’t understand why Russia needs to build this Potemkin village.”\n",
      "The vaccine is being developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which have said it is undergoing Phase 3 trials, the final stage of testing during which it is given to thousands of people to determine its fitness for use.

      "RDIF will be able to produce more than 500 million doses a year in five countries, with mass immunizations in Russia planned to begin in October, Dmitriev said.\n",
      "RDIF plans to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, India, and the Philippines, according to the Sputnik V website. Mass production is lined up in India, South Korea, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Cuba, it said, with at least 20 countries interested in obtaining supplies.\n",
      "WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said last week that all vaccine candidates should adhere to established practices and finish clinical trials before being made widely available.\n",

      "Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara\n",
      "“We are in close collaboration with WHO to intensify our preparations for the Solidarity Vaccine Trial, including the identification of trial sites in the country. In addition, we are continuously monitoring several vaccine candidates with the technical help from the Vaccine Expert Panel,” said Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara, Chair of the sub-Technical Working Group (TWG) on Vaccine Development and DOST Undersecretary for Research and Development. DOST- Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD) said that the Solidarity Vaccine Trial will ensure prompt, efficient, and reliable evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the many SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates currently being developed worldwide. To date, over 100 countries have expressed interest to participate in this large-scale vaccine trial.The Philippines’ participation in the trial was approved by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) as recommended by the Sub-TWG on Vaccine Development led by DOST.\n",
      "Two weeks ago, DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña announced that the agency has nominated a representative to be part of the WHO COVID-19 candidate vaccine prioritization working group which aims to identify the vaccines to be included in the upcoming WHO Solidarity Vaccine Trials.\n",
      "Dela Pena said during his weekly report that the agency has nominated Dr. Nina Gloriani, Professor Emeritus at the University of the Philippines-Manila.\n",
      "The secretary said that the DOST Vaccine Expert Panel created to assist the Sub-TWG on Vaccine Trials is continuously holding meetings with companies willing to conduct clinical trials in the Philippines.\n",
      "Last June, DOST and PCHRD discussed its plans to capacitate local vaccine manufacturing in the country if clinical trial results are favorable.\n",
      "“The DOST has been in touch with several international partner institutions to collaborate on vaccine development so that we can participate in their clinical trials, as the country doesn’t have the capacity yet to develop vaccines on its own,” said DOST Undersecretary Guevara said.“Locally, we hope that the local pharmaceutical industry is open to the opportunity of capacitating our country in vaccines, not just for this pandemic, but to prepare for the future as well,” DOST Secretary de la Peña added.To give participants ideas on international discussions on COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Gloriani presented the list of best vaccine candidates, the status of development, and vaccine platforms of nine international partners which expressed interest in conducting clinical trials in the country.\n",
      "As part of DOST’s business propositions to pharmaceutical industries, Dr. Jaime C. Montoya, Executive Director of DOST- PCHRD stressed that the government will provide support to the private sector’s conduct of clinical trials and assistance in product registration for pharma groups.\n",
      "“The Philippines will be dependent on global supply of vaccines if it will not be developed locally, so to get hold early, it will be beneficial for the country to require a license to manufacture for local pharmaceutical industries and to meet the local demand for vaccines,” said Dr. Montoya.

      "Russia is one of the few countries that expressed readiness to supply the Philippines with the COVID-19 vaccine once mass production in Moscow starts.Russian authorities earlier announced that the vaccine developed at the Gameleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology will be officially registered on Wednesday, August 12, 2020, in preparation for the third and last stage which is the testing to ensure that the vaccine is safe.After the final stage, Russian health officials are planning a nationwide mass vaccination program sometime in October giving priority to medical workers and the elderly.On Friday, Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev assured the Philippines that Moscow is ready to supply Manila and even invest in the local production of the vaccine.Khovaev said after the completion of all the bureaucratic procedures by mid-August, Russia will be ready to prepare for launching what he described as an “effective and safe” COVID-19 vaccine.Russian experts defended the manner they managed to research and approve a formula for the vaccine, citing their country’s head start over the last 20 years it has spent in developing skills and trying to understand how viruses transmit.Aside from Russia, China also assured that it will prioritize the Philippines should the COVID-19 vaccine be made available for commercial use and distribution.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The Philippines, under the leadership of President Duterte, continues to deepen its engagements with Russia, United States, and other countries to ensure that Filipinos would have access to the development and supplies of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines once these are made available, Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong’’ Go said on Monday.\n",
      "Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go (OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Go, chairman of the Senate Health and Demography Committee, issued the statement after receiving a letter, dated August 1, from Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Philippines Igor Khovaev who informed him that Russia was nearing completion of the production of the vaccine against COVID-19.\n",
      "Khovaev has subsequently confirmed that Russia has already successfully completed the clinical trials (phase 3) for the world’s first vaccine against COVID-19.“Tatlong bagay ang nasa offer ni Ambassador Khovaev. Una, na dito rin sa Pilipinas mag-conduct ng clinical trials. Magsu-supply din sila sa atin ng bakunang ito kontra COVID-19.At, pangatlo, plano nilang mag-set up ng local manufacturing dito mismo sa bansa natin,’’ Go said. (Ambassador Khovaev has offered three things: First, the clinical trials will be conducted here in the Philippines;second, they will supply usthe vaccines against COVID-19;and third, they are planning to set up local manufacturing here in our country.)\n",
      "The vaccine, using the trade name “Avigavir,” has been developed by the National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology under the name of N.F. Gamaleya of the Russian Ministry of Health.\n",
      "The center has previously developed successful vaccines against Ebola fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus. The vaccine research was supported by the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). It was the RDIF that proposed to establish partnership with the Philippines in the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing and distribution.\n",
      "“Dahil sa maayos na independent foreign policy of ‘being an enemy to none and a friend to all’ ni Pangulong Duterte, nasisiguro ng pamahalaan natin na meron tayong access sa development at, eventually, mga supply ng bakuna kontra COVID-19 mula sa mga bansa na itinuturing nating mga development partners,’’ Go explained.(Due to the good independent foreign policy of ‘being an enemy to none and a friend to all’ of President Duterte, the government has been assured access to the development, and eventually, we will have the supply of the vaccine against COVID-19 from the countries we considered as our development partners.)Go attributed President Duterte’s independent foreign policy for this, which is anchored on a national security policy that puts a balanced emphasis on the welfare and well-being of the Filipino people.\n",
      "The senator from Davao also stated that the Philippine Ambassador to the United States, Jose Manuel Romualdez, confirmed that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is urging two vaccine manufacturers to meet Romualdez anytime this week. “Inaayos ang pagpupulong between our ambassador to the United States and at least two vaccine manufacturers in the US (The meeting between our ambassador to the United States and at least two vaccine manufacturers in the US is now being arranged),” Go said.Novavax is reportedly also interested in co-manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines.\n",
      "The President, in his recent State of the Nation Address (SONA), also revealed that he talked to his Chinese counterpart President Xi Jinping to ensure access of the Philippines to Chinese vaccine against COVID-19, Go said.\n",
      "As of August 7, at least six vaccines are entering Phase 3 trials, according to Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization – Health Emergencies Program.\n",
      "Phase 3 trials are conducted involving the general population and are required before making available to the public any vaccine produced to further ensure its safety.They are designed to determine if the vaccine being developed can protect a large number of people over a longer period of time.Previous trials had focused on safety, immunogenicity, and immune response in a smaller number of people.\n",
      "To date, at least 165 vaccines against COVID-19 are being developed under various trial stages, with 26 of them now under clinical trials.Go previously urged the national government to come up with a national vaccine program to ensure access particularly for the poorest of the poor and other vulnerable Filipinos should a vaccine against COVID-19 become available. “Unahin dapat ‘yung mga mahihirap na nangangailangan ng vaccine pero walang kakayahan na makabili nito. Dapat siguraduhing maging available, accessible at affordable ito sa lahat. Dapat pantay-pantay,’’ he said. (We should prioritize the poor who need the vaccine but do not have the means to buy it. We should also ensure that the vaccine will be available, accessible, and affordable to all. It has to be fair.)\n",
      "The Department of Finance had earlier announced that it has earmarked P20 billion for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, with Go also appealing to the government to allocate additional funds.\n",
      "Go reminded concerned government agencies that they are expected to prioritize, coordinate, and report to the President and the Filipino people the developments on this issue of national importance.\n",
      "“Patuloy po nating hinaharap ang epekto ng pandemya sa ating buhay. Bigyan natin ang ating mga kababayan ng balitang mas magpapalakas ng kanilang loob,’’ he added.

      "A physician overseeing a clinical trial in Washington for Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine has warned it will be impossible to tell how well it works without recruiting enough elderly and ethnic minority volunteers.\n",
      "By the end of this week, David Diemert, an infectious diseases physician and professor of medicine at George Washington University, will start enrolling 500 people (AFP Photo/Bastien INZAURRALDE)\n",
      "This is particularly crucial when it comes to COVID-19 — a disease that kills black people and Latinos twice as often as whites, according to US federal data.Eight out of ten deaths are among those over 65.By the end of this week, David Diemert, an infectious diseases doctor and professor of medicine at George Washington University, will start enrolling 500 people.\n",
      "The process will take two months. Washington is one of 90 test sites nationwide for the mRNA vaccine developed by the National Institutes of Health and biotech Moderna.It will involve 30,000 people and take at least two years to fully complete, though its developers have said they hope to have preliminary results that could win an emergency use authorization within months.\n",
      "“I’d say our main challenges are going to be enrolling that many people in a very short period of time, it’s much quicker than you’re normally used to,” said Diemert, who has overseen past vaccine trials into HIV and hookworm among other diseases.“We are aiming for individuals who are at greater risk of developing symptomatic COVID infection, so older people, and also people from communities of color.”\n",
      "Past medical research in the United States has been plagued by focusing on homogeneous populations, skewing results, despite federal guidelines to include diverse groups, he said.\n",
      "A study found that of 167 new medicines approved by the US between 2008 and 2013, about a fifth showed differences in response levels across ethnic groups.Another example: for many years clinicians relied on a diagnostic called Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, which was only validated among white women and drastically underestimated risk for black women who are more susceptible at younger ages.\n",
      "Diemert added that, as a city with a 45 percent black population, Washington was an important site for investigation.\n",
      "George Washington University teams therefore are going on recruitment drives — to testing centers, churches, and market places.\n",
      "Part of their job is to try to win over trust in a community still leery toward drug research given the legacy of the Tuskegee experiments.In those, doctors intentionally did not treat black men with syphilis so they could study its progression in the 1932-1972 program.One thing Diemert wants people to know: according to earlier trial stages, the vaccine causes less severe side-effects in the elderly compared to young people, possibly as a result of less robust immune systems among the old.\n",
      "The actual shot is two injections in the shoulder “just like you would get your regular flu shot,” spaced a month apart.\n",
      "Leading the trial in the US capital is “both exciting and daunting,” added Diemert, given the world’s hopes for a swift return to normal.\n",
      "“This is a good opportunity for people to contribute to their community in trying to put an end to this disease, and to participate in an altruistic way.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "US biotech company Novavax on Tuesday announced its experimental COVID-19 vaccine elicited a robust immune response, producing more antibodies than are present in recovered patients, and with generally tolerable side-effects in its early-stage trial.\n",
      "The company was given $1.6 billion by the US government last month to develop and fund the drug under Operation Warp Speed — but in terms of timeline it is behind other firms including Moderna and AstraZeneca which have entered the final stages of their trials.\n",
      "It reported in a press release that the phase one stage of its placebo-controlled trial involved 131 healthy adults aged 18-59 and two dose groups of five and 25 micrograms.Side effects included soreness at the site of injection, headache, fatigue and muscle pain. These were classified as mild to moderate, and none were severe.\n",
      "After the first dose, all subjects who got the vaccine developed antibodies that block SARS-CoV-2’s “spike protein,” which it uses to latch on to human cells.\n",
      "Most also developed “neutralizing antibodies” which are more potent and prevent viruses from infecting cells.\n",
      "After a second dose given 28 days later, all participants had the more powerful neutralizing antibodies.Novavax reported that the lower dose performed comparably with the higher dose, which is important when it comes to mass production and because lower doses generally elicit fewer side effects.\n",
      "Antibodies are infection-fighting proteins made by the immune system.Another part of the immune response comes in the form of T cells, types of white blood cells that have the capability to kill infected cells and which are increasingly thought to play an important role against COVID-19.Novavax said it looked for these cells in a subset of participants and found they were present.\n",
      "The trial was supported by funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and was conducted at two sites inAustralia.\n",
      "Novavax has not yet shared the detailed findings but said it was submitting the research for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and to medical preprint site medrxiv.org.The final stage Phase 3 trial of its vaccine, called NVX-CoV2373, is set to take place this fall.\n",
      "The Maryland-based company grows synthesized pieces of the SARS-CoV-2’s “spike protein,” which triggers an immune response, inside insect cells in order to help scale up production.It also uses an “adjuvant,” a compound that boosts the production of neutralizing antibodies.\n",
      "The company says the drug, which is a liquid formulation, can be stored at two degrees celsius to eight degrees celsius, refrigerator temperature.\n",
      "In the spring, the company said it had proven the efficacy of a seasonal flu vaccine it had developed using the same technology. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "In his public address on Sunday, the Presidentsaid the NPA and the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) do not have to respond to his declaration that he will allow them to get vaccinated as long as they behave.He added that he already asked the military to accommodate the communist rebels if they peacefully line up to get the shots.“If they (NPA) really want to get their shots (for) free, they can always line up.

      "State-lenders Land Bank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) would provide loans to private companies planning to locally supply the coronavirus vaccines for commercial purposes.\n",
      "Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said that qualified borrowers may tap the two government banks for the sale of any Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Dominguez said this financing option is aimed at complementing the national government’s COVID-19 immunization program that will cater only to 20 million Filipinos considered as poorest of the poor.\n",
      "“They [Land Bank and DBP] can fund loans to qualified borrowers who wish to supply FDA-approved vaccines on a commercial basis,” Dominguez told reporters in a mobile phone message.Buoyed by the progress in the global race for the coronavirus vaccine, Dominguez said last Friday that the government will purchase P20 billion worth of vaccines once supplies become available. Under the initial plan unveiled by President Duterte, Land Bank and DBP will provide a P20 billion loan to Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC), the state-owned trading firm mandated to purchase the COVID-19 vaccines from overseas. The PITC will then sell the vaccines to the Department of Health (DOH) payable in several years. The P20 billion worth of COVID-19 vaccines, equivalent to 40 million doses, will be given for free to the poor beneficiaries.Currently, three pharmaceutical firms from China, a company from the United Kingdom, and another firm from the United States are expected to complete the third stage of the trials of their potential coronavirus vaccines by October.Dominguez said the two state-owned lenders can fully fund the estimated P20 billion budget for vaccines without support from the national government due to Land Bank and DBP’s strong balance sheets.He said Land Bank and DBP, being the third and ninth largest lenders in the country in terms of assets, respectively, will not get any additional capitalization from the national government to fund the loan. “The current balance sheets of both GFIs can support the estimated loan requirement of P20 billion. Please recall that since 2016—by hardly collecting any dividends from Land Band and DBP—the national government in effect strengthened their capital bases,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The Philippines has two potential sources ofthe highly-coveted COVID-19 vaccine – the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility and China.\n",
      "Most optimistic projections have the vaccine ready before 2020 ends.\n",
      "FAIR DISTRIBUTION FOR ALLSeveral countries are concerned about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available, since countries with access might prioritize their own citizens before sharing it with the rest of the world, the reason why the COVAX Facility is strongly backed by the World Health Organization (WHO), since it is whereparticipating countries will be guaranteed fast and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“COVAX is the only truly global solution to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “For the vast majority of countries, whether they can afford to pay for their own doses or require assistance, it means receiving a guaranteed share of doses and avoiding being pushed to the back of the queue, as we saw during the H1N1 pandemic a decade ago.”\n",
      "Berkley explained that even countries able to purchase and secure their own vaccines directly from manufacturers will benefit from COVAX because the scheme reduces “the risks associated with individual candidates failing to show efficacy or gain licensure.”\n",
      "Seventy-five countries have submitted expressions of interest to be a part of the COVAX Facility. According to WHO, these countries would finance the vaccines and partner with 90 lower-income countries that would be supported through voluntary donations to Gavi’s COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).The 165 countries, including the Philippines, will enjoy rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Once COVAX is fully financed, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that participating governments such as the Philippines will have its share of the vaccine.\n",
      "The WHO said that the goal of COVAX is to deliver two billion doses of safe and effective medicine by the end of 2021. These vaccines must have passed regulatory approval and WHO prequalification.\n",
      "The vaccines will be delivered to the participating countries, and the number of vaccines will be proportionate to their populations. Healthcare workers will be given priorities to the vaccines.Extra vaccine doses will be made available to any country based on its need, vulnerability, and COVID-19 threat. At the same time, the COVAX Facility will maintain a “buffer of doses” in case of emergencies and for humanitarian use.\n",
      "WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swminathan gave COVAX her seal of approval.\n",
      "“The COVID-19 pandemic, like every health crisis, also presents us with opportunities,” she said.“A vaccine that is affordable and accessible to all will help us address systemic health inequalities. We need all countries to support COVAX to achieve this goal and bring an end to the acute phase of the pandemic.”\n",
      "Countries that have submitted expressions of interest to the facility are Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.\n",
      "CHINA VACCINE\n",
      "It seems the Philippines has all bases covered when it comes to the COVID-19 vaccine as China vowed to consider the country’s request to be given first priority.\n",
      "A report from the Chinese Global Television Network said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin affirmed President Duterte’s remarks during the 2020 State-of-the-Nation Address (SONA) that China will give priority to its “friendly neighbor” should it succeed in developing a vaccine for COVID-19.\n",
      "“Since the COVID-19 outbreak, China and the Philippines have been helping and supporting each other in the efforts to fight the pandemic, attesting to the mutual cooperation that has brought out a new highlight in bilateral relations,” said Wang. “We are willing to give priority to the vaccine request made by China’s friendly neighbor the Philippines.”\n",
      "PROMISING VACCINE\n",
      "There are two vaccines that are currently being developed that show much promise.\n",
      "These are from Moderna Inc., which is based in Massachusetts, and Oxford University in England.\n",
      "The University of Oxford vaccine appears to be leading the pack as its head scientist, Sarah Gilbert, said that it has an 80 percent probability of stopping people exposed to COVID-19 patients from developing the virus, according to Bloomberg Newsweek. Gilbert said she would know by September if that is indeed the case.\n",
      "According to the New England Journal of Medicine, Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response and prevented the virus from replicating in the noses and lungs of monkeys.\n",
      "The study said this prevention of the virus from replicating in the noses and lungs is crucial in the prevention against further spread of the virus.\n",
      "The scientific journal The Lancet reported that Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine produces strong immune response.\n",
      "Prof. Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford University and co-author of the study, said that Phase 1 and 2 data for their COVID-19 vaccine showed no “unexpected reactions.” However, they must still continue with their “rigorous clinical trial program” in order to confirm the vaccine in humans.\n",
      "Oxford is working hand-in-hand with the UK-based global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to mass-produce the vaccines and eventual distribution. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Senator Christopher “Bong” Go today urged anew the Department of Health (DOH) and other concerned agencies to prepare a national coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine program in order to ensure the accessibility and affordability of the vaccine, once it is made available, even to the poorest of the poor and, most especially, to the vulnerable sectors.Sen. Bong Go (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Once the vaccine and medicines for COVID-19 are available, we should be prepared to provide all Filipinos who need them, especially the poor,’’ Go, chairman of the Senate health and demography committee, said.\n",
      "Go warned that difficult decisions would have to be made once a vaccine is available.Hence, the need to already plan and anticipate possible scenarios in order to ensure that the vaccine can be accessible to those who need it the most, he said.“Huwag sana pabayaan ang mga mahihirap. Paghandaan na natin ngayon palang. Magtabi na tayo ng budget para masigurong kakayanin ng gobyerno na matulungan ang mga mahihirap. Magkaroon po tayo ng plano kung saan dapat pantay-pantay at hindi lang ang mga may kaya sa buhay ang makakakuha,’’ he explained. (The poor should not be left behind. We should prepare as early as now to ensure that the government can afford to help the poor. Let’s have a plan wherein everybody will be treated equally and not only the rich can have access to [the vaccine and medicines].)In his recent speech during the virtual launch of the country’s 77th Malasakit Center in Guimaras, Go also said that preparations for the availability of the vaccine are already being discussed and developed by the country’s health officials and finance managers.“Nagkausap po kami ni (Finance) Secretary (Carlos)Dominguez kahapon at gagawan na po nila ng paraan. Once available ‘yung vaccine ay handa po ‘yung gobyerno para bumili ng vaccine,’’ he said. (I have talked to Secretary Dominguez yesterday and he informed me that they’re now finding ways and means [to produce the funds needed]. Once the vaccine is available, the government must be ready to purchase it.)Go stressed that once a vaccine is available, no one should be left behind when it comes to access.\n",
      "President Rodrigo Duterte, in his address to the people today, appealed to the public to cooperate and trust the government as necessary measures are already being implemented while the availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 is still being studied by scientists and health experts.President Duterte said the Philippines would likely get COVID-19 vaccines first from China, as he noted that developments of different vaccines are also underway.On distribution of vaccines once it is available, the President also reiterated, “Ang mauna ‘yung walang-wala… tsaka ‘yung mga nasa hospital… ‘Yung pangalawa, middle income. Libre ito, hindi ko ito ipagbili…. (The first to get it will be the poor…and those in the hospitals….comes second are the milddle income earners. This is for free. I will not sell it…)”Dominguez also said that the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) would help in the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.Dominguez explained that the country might need to vaccinate for free a minimum of 20 million people.\n",
      "“If one to two shots are needed, that is around 40 million doses and at around $10 per dose, that is $400 M or P20 billion,” according to the finance secretary who added that the economy is already beginning to recover from its lowest point last April to May. “Wala tayong problema sa liquidity. May pera (We have no problem in liquidity. There is money). Inflation is within target. We are the strongest currency in the region,” Dominguez added, reiterating that once the COVID-19 vaccine is available, Filipinos can most likely go back to their normal lives.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Senators on Friday urged the government to proceed with caution on its plan to purchase and distribute COVID-19 vaccines once they are available.\n",
      "President Duterte, in a taped address aired Friday morning, announced his plan for a mass immunization program for coronavirus. An initial fund of P20 billion will be allocated for the procurement of the COVID-19 vaccines that will be given for free to the poor and the sick.\n",
      "Senator Joel Villanueva said coronavirus vaccines are still undergoing the World Health Organization’s (WHO) evaluation and that there are risks involved with developing them in haste.The WHO said that as of July 27, 25 candidate vaccines are under various stages of clinical evaluation with at least five of them in the third phase of the clinical trials.\n",
      "“Not to be overly optimistic, we wish that there will be transparency in the experimental results of these vaccines,” Villanueva said.\n",
      "“We know the urgency to have a vaccine as soon as possible but there are risks attached to fast tracking the development of vaccines that normally takes 10 years to produce,” he added.\n",
      "He urged the Food and Drug Administration to “exercise rigor in approving the vaccines that will be available for us.”Villanueva added that “no one should be discriminated against from accessing the vaccine.”\n",
      "“It’s the obligation of the State to support the right to health,” he said.\n",
      "Senator Francis Pangilinan said that President Duterte should fire Health Secretary Francisco Duque III before implementing his free vaccine distribution plan.\n",
      "“Before we even begin to take the President’s plan seriously, he should fire Duque. His (Duterte) proposals to address COVID rings hollow and empty when he condones incompetence and corruption and when his team continues to miss their targets for mass testing, contact tracing, and treatment, and in doing so has miserably failed to stop the spread of the disease,” Pangilinan said.The opposition senator has been firm in his call for Duque’s resignation. He recently voted against the passage of the proposed Bayanihan 2 law in the Senate as he stood pat that Duque should step down before additional funds are released to the Department of Health (DOH) for its COVID-19 response.\n",
      "Early this month, the DOH said the country is set to participate in the clinical trials for five candidate vaccines for COVID-19 from China and Taiwan. The DOH is also preparing for its participation in the WHO’s Solidarity Trials for Vaccine.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "In his televised address Friday, the President asked the New People’s Army (NPA) rebels not to harm the government troops who will be assigned to supervise the vaccine distribution program as soon as the supplies are available.\n",
      "Duterte made the statement amid high hopes the vaccine to the dreaded viral illness may be available before the end of the year.“Yung mga NPA pabakunahan ko ba? If you stop fighting for a while during the period or until December kasi my soldiers will be busy monitoring, supervising, huwag lang ninyo galawin, pwede kayong sumali at pumila doon (Will I let the NPA be vaccinated? If you stop fighting for a while during the period or until December because my soldiers will be busy monitoring, supervising, do not harm them and you may join and fall in line),” Duterte said.\n",

      "The President has remained hopeful about the potential coronavirus vaccine by December, citing the efforts in vaccine development by China. He appreciated China’s gesture to prioritize the country’s request for vaccine access.Once the coronavirus vaccines are available, the government plans to purchase the supply and prioritize the poorest of the poor in the vaccination program.\n",
      "Duterte said he wants the military to supervise the vaccine distribution program “to remove partisanship, favoritism, and petty corruption.” “However you do it, I don’t care. I just want unified monitoring and supervising. We intend to vaccinate every Filipino for that matter,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Buoyed by the progress in the global race for the coronavirus vaccine, the Duterte government will purchase ₱20 billion worth of vaccines once the supplies become available.President Rodrigo Roa Duterte talks to the people after holding a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) core members at the Malago Clubhouse in Malacañang on July 30, 2020.\n",

      "The proposed fund allocation comes after President Duterte presented the government’s plan to prioritize the country’s poorest of the poor for the coronavirus immunization program.Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said Friday that the Land Bank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) can fully fund the estimated ₱20-billion budget for vaccines without support of the national government due to Land Bank and DBP’s strong balance sheets.\n",
      "Under plan, Land Bank and DBP, two government financial institutions (GFIs), will provide a loan to the Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC), the state-owned company mandated by President Duterte to purchase COVID-19 vaccines from overseas.Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon M. Lopez said the ₱20 billion worth of vaccines is just an initial batch.“The GFIs will fund PITC’s purchase with a term loan for the purchase of the vaccines identified by the DOH [Department of Health].PITC will sell the vaccines to the DOH. The DOH will pay PITC over time from their future allocations from the national budget,” Dominguez said.\n",
      "“We can pay that over maybe two or three years. So they will pay the financing companies which are Land Bank and DBP. These can finance the purchase of the vaccines which will be about ₱20 billion,” he added.He said Land Bank and DBP, being the third and ninth largest lenders in the country in terms of assets, respectively, will not get any additional capitalization from the national government to fulfil the President’s directive.“The current balance sheets of both GFIs can support the estimated loan requirement of ₱20 billion. In his taped public address, the President welcomed the progress in vaccine development, particularly expressing appreciation for China’s offer to prioritize the Philippines’ access to the vaccine and medicines. Once the vaccine is available, Duterte said the government will purchase these and tap the military to help in the distribution.Read more: AFP ready to assist in COVID vaccine distribution\n",
      "“I promise you by the grace of God, I hope by December we will be back to normal. Don’t expect the new normal because I said when we started, let us just wait for the vaccine,” Duterte said.“Just wait by December if you can be patient. Because if you keep going out and get infection, you’ll end up dead,” he said.Under his free vaccine distribution plan, Duterte said the poor beneficiaries of the government’s subsidy program will be the first to benefit.The middle-income people as well as soldiers, policemen, and uniformed personnel will also be entitled to the free coronavirus vaccines.\n",
      "Excluded from the government’s distribution list are the country’s rich “who can buy their own vaccine” as well as the “drug pushers and drug addicts,” according to the President.“Those who have nothing will be the first beneficiaries and of course those in the hospitals, the sick, and dying. We will prioritize the people on the list of those getting assistance from the government,” the President said.“’Yung mga mayaman, huwag na ninyong – huwag na ninyo akong isipin kasi hindi ako nag-iisip sa inyo. Sorry na lang. Kayo kung makaafford (To the rich, don’t think of me because I don’t think about you. Sorry. You can already afford),” he added.Duterte said he would ask Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and the military to implement the distribution of the coronavirus vaccines to the rightful beneficiaries.“Libre ito. Hindi ko ito ipagbili (This is for free. I won’t sell it),” he said. In the meeting with some Cabinet members, the President asked Dominguez to discuss how the government will finance the vaccine acquisition program. Dominguez said the government could provide vaccines for free initially for 20 million people as estimated by the Department of Health.The DOF chief said three pharmaceutical firms from China, a company from the United Kingdom, and another firm from the United States are expected to complete the third stage of the trials of their potential coronavirus vaccines by October.“Before December most likely ma-a-approve na po ‘yun ng mga FDA nila, ‘yung Food and Drug Administration. So when that happens ho, ang Department of Health ang mamili kung anong tamang bakuna ang bibilhin (Before December, mostly like their Food and Drug Administrations (FDAs) will approve them. When that happens, the Department of Health will choose the right vaccine to be purchased),” Dominguez said.“Ang estimate ho ng Department of Health, we will need to vaccinate for free a minimum of 20 million people ‘di ba? So I don’t know if it’s one vaccine or two shots, two shots. So we need – so 40 million vaccines – doses, 40 million doses. Ang 40 million doses times roughly 10 dollars per dose ‘di ba is 400 million dollars or roughly 20 billion pesos,” he said.Dominguez said if the vaccine costs $10 per dose, the pharmaceutical firms may sell the medicine around ₱1,200 to include the service and transportation of the product.“That’s totally available, the financing is available for this program,” he added.

      "US biotech firm Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response and prevented the coronavirus from replicating in the noses and lungs of monkeys, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine said Tuesday.\n",
      "A colorized scanning electron micrograph of a cell (blue) heavily infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus particles (red), isolated from a patient sample (AFP Photo/MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The fact that the vaccine prevented the virus from replicating in the nose is seen as particularly crucial in preventing it from being transmitted onward to others.The same outcome did not occur when the University of Oxford’s vaccine was tested on monkeys, though that vaccine did prevent the virus from entering the animals’ lungs and making them very sick.In the Moderna animal study, three groups of eight rhesus macaques received either a placebo or the vaccine at two different dose levels — 10 micrograms and 100 micrograms.\n",
      "All vaccinated macaques produced high levels of neutralizing antibodies that attack a part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus used to invade cells.\n",
      "Notably, monkeys receiving both dose levels produced these antibodies at levels higher than those found in humans who have recovered from COVID-19.\n",
      "The authors reported that the vaccine also induced the production of a different immune cell known as T-cells that may have helped boost the overall response.A major area of concern is that vaccines under development could actually backfire by amplifying rather than suppressing the disease.\n",
      "So-called vaccine-associated enhancement of respiratory disease (VAERD) has been linked to the production of a specific type of T-cell known as Th2 — but these cells were not produced during the experiment, suggesting this vaccine won’t backfire.\n",
      "Four weeks after the monkeys received their second injection, they were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, both through the nose and directly to the lungs via a tube.After two days, no replicating virus was detected in the lungs of seven of the eight macaques in both the low and high dose groups.\n",
      "By contrast, all eight in the placebo group continued to have the virus present.\n",
      "None of the eight macaques in the high dose groups had detectable levels of virus in their noses two days after exposure.“This is the first time an experimental COVID-19 vaccine tested in nonhuman primates has been shown to produce such rapid viral control in the upper airway,” said the National Institutes for Health, which co-developed the vaccine.\n",
      "A COVID-19 vaccine capable of stopping the virus in the lungs will prevent the disease from becoming severe, while stopping the virus from replicating in the nose would lessen transmission.The Moderna vaccine uses genetic material in the form of viral RNA to encode the information needed to grow the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inside the human body to trigger an immune response.\n",
      "Spike proteins give coronaviruses their crown-like appearance and are used to invade human cells, but by themselves are thought to be relatively harmless.\n",
      "The advantage of this technology is that it bypasses the need to manufacture viral proteins in the lab, helping to ramp up mass production.\n",
      "Both Moderna’s vaccine and the vaccine co-developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have entered late-stage human trials. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "US President Donald Trump vowed to defeat the coronavirus by “unleashing American scientific genius” as he toured a COVID-19 vaccine facility in the swing state of North Carolina on Monday.\n",
      "Trump appears to have pinned his hopes on the swift emergence of a successful vaccine to both contain the country’s still raging epidemic and revive his faltering re-election hopes (AFP Photo/JIM WATSON)\n",
      "Trump appears to have pinned his hopes on the swift emergence of a successful vaccine to both contain the country’s still raging epidemic and revive his faltering re-election hopes.“We will achieve a victory over the virus by unleashing American scientific genius,” he told reporters at Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies in Morrisville, hours after it was revealed national security advisor Robert O’Brien had tested positive.\n",
      "The facility has been awarded a contract to mass produce an experimental vaccine developed by Novavax, as part of a multi-billion dollar government initiative dubbed Operation Warp Speed.\n",
      "The plan involves investing heavily in leading pharmaceuticals to aid their development and manufacturing efforts, with the goal of delivering 300 million doses of vaccine by January 2021.\n",
      "It’s “never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work, and work very well,” added Trump, who later donned a black mask and toured the lab.The United States is by far the worst-hit country in the world, with more than 4.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and nearly 150,000 deaths.\n",
      "Though the number of new cases has leveled off over the past few days, the US has failed to push its curve down as other nations have done through lockdowns and physical distancing.\n",
      "Trump’s latest comments confirmed that the administration believes that, in America’s case, only a vaccine can help.“It’s not masks. It’s not shutting down the economy. Hopefully, it is American ingenuity that will allow for therapies and vaccines to ultimately conquer this,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told ABC News on Sunday.\n",
      "The virus has also repeatedly penetrated Trump’s inner circle, with O’Brien the latest and most senior White House aide to test positive.\n",
      "He “has been self-isolating and working from a secure location off site,” the White House said in a statement Monday, adding that there was “no risk of exposure to the president or the vice president.”\n",
      "Others who have been previously infected include Vice President Mike Pence’s spokeswoman Katie Miller, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a top fundraiser for the Trump campaign and his elder son’s girlfriend.\n",
      "Results by November?\n",
      "The US has spent more than $6.3 billion since March to fund vaccine development efforts under Operation Warp Speed.The program is unabashed in its aims to procure vaccines for the American people first — unlike European leaders who have called for COVID-19 drugs to be a “global public good.”\n",
      "Pharmaceutical newcomer Moderna, which, alongside AstraZeneca and two Chinese firms is among those furthest in its development timeline, began the final stage of its clinical trial Monday.\n",
      "The trial is being co-conducted by the National Institutes for Health (NIH) across the United States and is expected to enroll approximately 30,000 adult volunteers.\n",
      "Participants will get two doses of the vaccine given 28 days apart.\n",
      "The first volunteer, a Black woman identified as Robyn, participated in a video chat hosted by the NIH on Monday, telling viewers her friends and relatives had initially told her “it was a bad idea.”\n",
      "“And the reason for that was because in the African American community, we are all familiar with the Tuskegee experiments,” she added, referring to a 40-year-study the US conducted on Black men to see the effects of untreated syphilis.\n",
      "The men involved were kept in the dark about cures on purpose.\n",
      "But, added Robyn, she was encouraged by laws that are now in place to prevent a repetition, and motivated by the desire to help others against a disease that disproportionately impacts communities of color.\n",
      "An irony of the process is that, given the rampant nature of the US epidemic, results could come far sooner than the two years the trial is set to run.\n",
      "Daily new cases have plateaued around the 66,000 mark for the past few days, making it more likely that trial participants will be exposed to the virus sooner rather than later.\n",
      "“It’s a really optimistic scenario. It could be November,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC on Monday. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Pres. Rodrigo Duterte\n",
      "Duterte made the statement as he delivered his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday.\n",
      "In his speech, the President acknowledged that every country, including the Philippines, is living in troubled times because of the pandemic.“Our dream of prosperity for our country was suddenly snuffed by a pandemic virulent virus. No nation was spared. Neither rich nor poor were exempt from the onslaught of this deadly disease,” he said.\n",
      "However, President Duterte assured Filipinos that they do not have to wait much longer for a vaccine as it will be coming soon even though it would be difficult to access.\n",
      "“But let us not despair. The vaccine is around the corner. Sooner and not later, the virus that gobbled up thousands of lives will itself be laid to rest,” he said.\n",
      "“How to get it (vaccine) from the producers or other governments is really something which we have to deal with it because everyone… It’s a global need and everyone will go for it,” he added.According to President Duterte, he already asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to allow the Philippines to have first dibs on their vaccine.\n",
      "“About four days ago I made a plea to President Xi Jinping that if they have the vaccine, can they allow us to be one of the first, or if needed, if we have to buy it, that we will be granted credit so that we can normalize as fast as possible,” he said.\n",

The China National Pharmaceutical Group (SinoPharm) said this week that a vaccine could be ready by the end of 2020.Studies published in The Lancet medical journal showed that two COVID-19 vaccine candidates have proven safe for humans and produced strong immune reactions among patients involved in two separate clinical trials.The first trial among more than a thousand adults in Britain found that the vaccine induced ‘strong antibody and T cell immune responses’ against the novel coronavirus while a separate trial in China involving more than 500 people showed most had developed widespread antibody immune response.Meanwhile, while the world raced to secure COVID-19 vaccines before they are even ready, the United States government has announced a $1.95-billion contract with Pfizer and a German biotechnology company BioNTech for 100 million doses by December.Russia, on the other hand, said its first vaccine against COVID-19 was “ready” after two groups of volunteers have successfully completed clinical trials with all of them having “built up immunity.”SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "She said as early as now,the national government should start looking for funds to ensure that the 107 million Filipinos have access to the vaccine.\n",
      "“No. 1one requirement , siyempre ‘yung funds,‘yung pondo kasi ang vaccine naman, especially ang demand ay globally, so makikipag-agawan tayo sa ibang bansa. Mahalaga at this time napro-project na natin, kung paano natin pinaghandaan, for example ang Social Amelioration Program nawalang maiiwan, especiallythe vulnerable sectors.So ngayon pa lang hinahanda na natin,nakakapaghanda tayo (The No. 1 requirement is definitely funds,there will be global demand for vaccine, so we will compete with other countries. It is important that at this time,we already have our own projection, the way we prepared, for example, Social Amelioration Program that no one will be left behind, especiallythe vulnerable sectors. As early as now,we should prepare for it,we started our preparations),” she said in an interview over DZBB.She urged the government to gauge whether or notit has the capacity to provide the vaccines to all Filipinos and determine the sectors who will first receive the COVID-19 vaccination.\n",
      "“Kung talagang ang madevelop na vaccine ay puwedeng ibigay sa kahit anong edad,lahat siyempre gustong makakuha ng bakuna, pero kaya ba natin na magbigay nang sabay sabay? Darating ang pagkakataon na may kailangan kang unahin at may iprioritize ka (If a vaccine that will be developed can be given to all ages,given that all wanted to avail it, can you simultaneously give it to all? There comes a point that you have to prioritize),” Tan said.\n",
      "“So ngayon, dapat sila, duon sa atin sa Executive,tinitingnan na ‘yan so that dumating ang panahon na available na, implementation na lang, ready na tayo hindi ‘yung kelan dumating saka maghahanap tayo pondo, sino makakatangap, ilan sila, things like that (So now, the Executive should look into it so that once the vaccine becomes available, we just focus on the implementation, we are ready, we shouldn’t scramble for funds when the vaccine is already here, identify those who will receive,how many of them,things like that),” she said.\n",
      "The House leader said the government should now manage the people’s expectations, considering that all would like to avail the vaccine to protect themselves from the dreaded disease.\n",
      "“I am sure it will create chaos, dahil lahat ng tao may clamor na gusto nilang magpabakuna dahil gustung gusto natin na lumabas talaga (All have clamor to have themselves vaccinated) . ‘Yung fear na nararamadaman ng tao sa COVID (The fear being felt by the people due to COVID)dahil nga ang binabanggit ay (because it was mentioned) hindi tayobabalik sa normal hangga’t walang bakuna (we will not return to normalcy until there is no vaccine).

      "As the global race for the development of an anti-COVID-19 vaccine heated on the positive side, the chairperson of the House Committee on Health vowed Thursday to eliminate legal impediments against the immediate procurement of the vaccine.\n",
      "(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Quezon Rep. Helen Tan said under Republic Act 11223 or the Universal Health Care Act, stringent measures were set before new medicines and vaccines could be procured in the country.\n",
      "Tan noted that the law provides that “each intervention must have undergone Phase IV clinical trial, and systematic review and meta-analysis must be readily available. The interventions must also not pose any harm to the users and health care providers.”“As such, only vaccines, including drugs and medicines which have undergone Phase IV clinical trial and systematic review and meta-analysis, can be used for any population-based intervention,” she said.\n",
      "Tan noted that although Phase IV clinical trial is an important component that could ensure the safety of pharmaceutical drug or medical device, such post marketing surveillance requirement “may limit the country’s access to any breakthrough drugs and medicines.”\n",
      "“As one of the principal authors of the UHC law, I fully recognize the need to relax the post marketing surveillance requirement or Phase IV clinical trial as provided under the UHC law in times of public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said.\n",
      "Tan vowed to propose an exemption from the law in the procurement of newly-developed vaccines and interventions aimed at addressing the rising 2019 coronavirus infection among Filipinos.\n",
      "This can be done by putting such provision in the proposed “Bayanihan to Recover As One Act” or Bayanihan 2 that will be taken up soon by Congress.\n",
      "“Hence, as Chairperson of the Committee on Health and Co-Chair of the Joint Congressional Committee for UHC, I am taking the initiative to include under the ‘Bayanihan to Recover As One Act’ or Bayanihan 2, a provision that will grant the President of the Philippines the power to authorize the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines even without undergoing Phase IV clinical trial,” said Tan.\n",
      "Tan’s move will speed up the procurement process for COVID 19 vaccines and was inspired by reports that several leading international pharmaceutical firms and drug laboratories have reported positive results of development of candidate vaccines.Leading the pack of vaccine developers is US-based Moderna MRNA which became the first company to start human clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.\n",
      "The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday disclosed that the Moderna invention has resulted in “robust” immune response among participants of the human trial.\n",
      "Other optimistic developments were reported by Pfizer PFE which is collaborating with BioNTech, a biotech firm based in Germany.\n",
      "The US government has released $1.6 billion to finance the late-stage development of the coronavirus vaccine candidate of Novovax Inc.\n",
      "Reports said the US government funding will also finance Novovax’s bid to put up a large-scale manufacturing line for its NVX-CoV2373 by the end of 2020. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "WASHINGTON, United States – US biotech firm Moderna said Tuesday it would enter the final stage of human trials for its COVID-19 vaccine on July 27, to test how well it protects people in the real world.\n",
      "(AFP File Photo/Maddie Meyer/ MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "The announcement came as the results from an earlier trial intended to prove the vaccine was safe and triggered antibody production were published.\n",
      "The upcoming Phase 3 trial will recruit 30,000 participants in the US, with half to receive the vaccine at 100 microgram dose levels, and the other half will receive a placebo.Researchers will then track them over two years to determine whether\n",
      "they are protected against infection by the virus. Or, if they do get infected, whether the vaccine prevents symptoms from developing.\n",
      "If they do get symptoms, the vaccine can still be considered a success if it stops severe cases of COVID-19.\n",
      "The study should run until October 27, 2022, but preliminary results should be available long before.\n",
      "The announcement came after the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday published results from the first stage of Moderna’s vaccine trial, which showed the first 45 participants all developed antibodies to the virus.Moderna is considered to be in a leading position in the global race to\n",

      "The early results were called “encouraging” by Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is co-developing the vaccine.\n",
      "But some in the scientific community said they would reserve judgment until they saw the full results in peer-reviewed form.\n",
      "According to the paper, 45 participants were split into three groups to test doses of 25 micrograms, 100 micrograms and 250 micrograms.\n",
      "They were given a second dose of the same amount 28 days later.After the first round, antibody levels were found to be higher with higher doses.\n",
      "Following the second round, participants had higher levels of antibodies than most patients who have had COVID-19 and gone on to generate\n",
      "their own antibodies.\n",
      "More than half the participants experienced mild or moderate side ef-\n",
      "fects, which are considered normal.\n",
      "The side effects included fatigue, chills, headache, body ache and pain\n",
      "at the injection site.\n",
      "Three participants did not receive their second dose.\n",
      "They included one who developed a skin rash on both legs, and two who\n",
      "missed their window because they had COVID-19 symptoms, but their tests\n",
      "later returned negative.\n",
      "Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University, said it was encouraging that the participants developed high levels\n",
      "of an advanced class of antibodies.\n",
      "He added, however: “You have to be very limited in how much you can extrapolate from a phase one clinical trial, because you want to see how this works when a person is exposed to the actual virus.”\n",
      "The Moderna vaccine belongs to a new class of vaccine that uses genetic material – in the form of RNA – to encode the information needed to grow the virus’s spike protein inside the human body, in order to trigger an immune response.\n",
      "The spike protein is a part of the virus that it uses to invade human cells, but by itself the protein is relatively harmless.\n",
      "The advantage of this technology is that it bypasses the need to manufacture viral proteins in the lab, helping to ramp up mass production.\n",
      "No vaccines based on this platform have previously received regulatory approval.\n",
      "Early work using this technology backfired by making hosts more, not less, susceptible to infection, David Lo, a professor of biomedical sciences at University of California Riverside told AFP.\n",
      "“One of the things we certainly want to look out for is whether there is a long term effect where the immune response… potentially develops an immunologic tolerance which would actually be detrimental to protection,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Doctors most knowledgeable about vaccine development warn that, however promising a vaccine may seem now or months from now, premature release can do far more harm than goodBy DR. EDUARDO GONZALES\n",
      "I do not doubt that we will eventually develop a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19. The signs point to that—the virus does not mutate at a fast rate, some of the promising vaccines are already undergoing clinical trials, governments are cutting the red tape that is associated with vaccine approval, and manufacturing deals are already being signed.But let’s temper our expectations because, despite all this good news, a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine is unlikely to be available for mass immunization anytime soon. Furthermore, contrary to what most people think, a vaccine will not eradicate the virus overnight, if it eradicates the virus at all.It takes time to produce a new vaccine\n",
      "It takes years to produce a safe and effective vaccine. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years. Experts are not starting from scratch when it comes to the Covid-19 vaccine. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a relative of the SARS and MERS viruses, and a lot of work has already been done on the development of a vaccine for these two infections that can be put into good use in the development of a Covid-19 vaccine. Still, the most optimistic estimates place a Covid-19 vaccine as one to two years away.\n",
      "Vaccine development is a complex and painstaking multi-stage process. It starts with identifying the antigens (parts or weakened strains of a virus) that will be incorporated in the candidate vaccine. Then, tissue-culture or cell-culture and animal testing are performed to find out if the candidate vaccine will produce immunity.\n",
      "This is followed by three stages of clinical testing. Phase one entails testing for safety and immunogenicity in normal adults (less than 100 people), phase two entails testing for immunogenicity and safety in special populations (hundreds of human subjects), while phase three, which can include thousands of test subjects, continues to measure the safety (rare side effects sometimes don’t appear in smaller groups) and effectiveness of the candidate vaccine.After the clinical trials, the candidate vaccine is submitted for regulatory review and approval. It is only after it is approved by regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA), is a vaccine manufactured. A vaccine will not eradicate the virus overnight\n",
      "No vaccine is 100 percent effective. The flu vaccine is only 65 percent effective while the measles vaccine is 95 percent effective. Even if the Covid-19 vaccine turns out to be as highly effective as the flu vaccine, as many as five percent of people who get the vaccine can still get sick with Covid-19. But a vaccine need not be 100 percent effective to achieve herd immunity. Herd immunity refers to the protection from a contagious disease that is conferred on an entire population because enough of its people are immune to (i.e., they do not get or spread) the disease. The percentage of the population which must be immunized to achieve herd immunity varies for each disease. For highly contagious diseases, the required figure is high. Measles requires 90 to 95 percent immunization coverage to achieve herd immunity, polio is 80 to 85 percent, while for Covid-19, that remains to be determined.The measles vaccine has been around since the late ’60s and despite an effective vaccine and all-out immunization campaigns, as a country, we have not attained herd immunity from measles. Periodic outbreaks of the disease still occur, killing hundreds of Filipino children annually.\n",
      "To date, the only pathogenic virus we have eradicated worldwide is the smallpox virus. In 1958, armed with a safe and effective vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) started a global immunization campaign against smallpox. Yet it was only in 1979, more than 20 years later, that the WHO declared the world as free from smallpox.\n",
      "All indications, therefore, point to the fact that, even in the best-case scenario, the virus will stay with us for a long, long time. But the situation is not hopeless, because we can adopt certain lifestyle changes that can contain the spread of the virus and prevent it from infecting us. And I’m pretty certain that an antiviral drug that can alleviate if not cure Covid-19 will become available soon. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "In Friday’s episode of “Laging Handa” public briefing aired over state-run PTV-4, Roque said it does not matter anymore if other countries will first come up with a vaccine before China.“Basta po meron nang gamot diyan sa COVID-19, basta may bakuna, ibebenta natin lahat ng ari-arian ng ating gobyerno para makabili po tayo para sa ating mga kababayan.

      "Presidential Spokesperson Atty. Harry Roque\n",
      "(Jansen Romero / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the admission after clarifying his remarks that the country was “winning” the battle against the pandemic.Roque had earlier congratulated the nation for beating a University of the Philippines (UP) forecast on 40,000 cases of coronavirus cases last month, triggering a firestorm of criticisms from some lawmakers and groups for allegedly being misinformed. The country had 37,514 cases of infections at the end of June.\n",
      "“Kapag sinabi nating nananalo po tayo, dahil nahanda po natin ang ating health system para magbigay lunas sa mga magkakasakit bagamat tama po kayo, hindi talaga tayo mananalo habang walang bakuna, habang walang gamot dito sa sakit na ito (When we say we are winning, it is because we have prepared our health system to provide treatment for the sick. But you are right, we really cannot win until there is no vaccine, medicine to this disease),” Roque said during a Palace press briefing on Thursday.\n",
      "Roque explained that he was merely celebrating the “small victory” of the country in having cases lower than the UP forecast.\n",
      "Roque was reacting to Senator Nancy Binay’s pronouncement that it was premature to declare the country was winning the fight against the pandemic. Binay said there should be a “semblance of normalcy” if the country was indeed winning the fight. Metro Manila’s continued general community quarantine (GCQ) status belies Roque’s comment, she added.\n",
      "The country is largely under modified general community quarantine as the government moved to revive the economy and promote livelihood of the people.\n",
      "Cebu City remained under enhanced community quarantine due to the surge in infections, while Metro Manila kept its GCQ classification until mid-July. Other areas under GCQ are Benguet, Cavite, Rizal, Lapu-Lapu City, Mandaue City, Leyte, Ormoc, Southern Leyte, Talisay City, and the municipalities of Minglanilla and Consolacion in Cebu.\n",
      "As of July 2, the country has recorded 38,805 cases of coronavirus with 10,673 recoveries and 1,274 deaths.Roque has trumpeted the gains in the fight against coronavirus, citing the decrease in the fatality rate and the plateauing case positivity rate.\n",
      "“Ang patuloy na pagbababa ng mga namamatay sa virus ay matuturing nating small victory po. Ang tagumpay na ito, gaano man kaliit, ay tagumpay na masasabi (The continued drop in the deaths from the virus is considered a small victory. This victory, no matter how small, is still a victory),” he said.\n",
      "Roque also claimed that case positivity rate has somehow “plateaued” after it reached 7.12 percent. “Sa buwan po ng June, ito po ay more or less stable. At ngayon po, ang positivity rate natin ay 7.12, ibig sabihin po niyan – 7 out of 100 persons actually tested positive for COVID-19 (For the month of June, it is more or less stable. Our positivity rate is now 7.12, meaning seven out of 100 persons actually tested positive for COVID-19),” he said.\n",
      "He said the country could sustain the gains in containing the spread of the disease if the people will continue to cooperate and observe health measures. The wearing of face masks, frequent hand washing, and safe distancing from others could help stop the spread of infection, he added.\n",
      "On government efforts to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, Roque said they will accelerate expanded testing efforts to detect, isolate, and treat patients with illness. The government will also resort to “localized or granular lockdowns” to curb the spread of the illness while limiting its impact on the economy. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The House of Representatives is adopting a very optimistic and refreshing view in the worldwide fight against the COVID 19 pandemic – it will set aside funds for the purchase of vaccines against the viral scourge.\n",
      "House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano\n",
      "(Alan Peter Cayetano / Facebook page/ MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)\n",
      "As early as now, Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano said funds should “already be allocated for the COVID-19 vaccine” even as he described as “very conservative” the government plan to submit a P4.3-trillion annual budget for 2021.Currently, pharmaceutical research laboratories in United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, and China, a number of them financed by the US government, are now racing to develop the first vaccine that would stop the spread of the killer virus. But so far, there remains no assurance that one will be developed anytime soon.\n",
      "Still, Cayetano believes that funds should already be reserved to give Filipinos a bigger chance at getting vaccinated once an anti-COVID 19 vaccine is available.\n",
      "“What if there is a vaccine and they won’t supply unless you pay at once? So the funds should already be available in the budget,” he said.\n",
      "According to the House leader, a number of countries expect to develop a vaccine in about a year. He was apparently referring to various reports that the vaccine race has become very competitive worldwide.But if research laboratories fail to produce a vaccine, the House leader said the money allocated for the program could easily be used to finance COVID-19 testing or procure medical supplies.\n",
      "“They (government) won’t have to go back to Congress for additional appropriation,” Cayetano stated.\n",
      "Some eports indicated that Oxford University and pharmaceutical AstraZeneca have received huge funding from Great Britain and the US.French drugmaker Sanofi is also speeding up clinical trials of its vaccine candidate and is reportedly eyeing approval of regulatory authorities by the first six months of 2021.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore has also joined the race and is experimenting on a vaccine candidate that uses genetic material to create an immune response in the body.\n",
      "British press reported that Prince William had met patients participating in a human trial of what they claimed to be a promising COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "With these developments, Cayetano said he and his House colleagues “want to enter 2021 fully aware that the country has to meet the challenges of COVID-19 head-on.”\n",
      "Aside from the COVID-19 vaccine fund, the Lower House is also eyeing the allocation of funds for economic stimulus to help affected sectors recover from the harsh beatings they suffered during the pandemic.“We’re already talking about what part of the 2021 budget is stimulus as well,” he said.\n",
      "Such appropriations would be in addition to those that would be contained in Bayanihan 2 or the proposed “We Recover as One” law, he added.\n",
      "In an interview, Cayetano revealed that the House, together with the Senate and the Department of Finance, are now close to agreeing on the final version of the proposed legislation.\n",
      "“I think 80-90 percent we’ve gone over it and we already have some consensus,” he said.\n",
      "Bayanihan 2 would include loans for small and medium businesses, and funds for the procurement of more testing and medical supplies, and for tourism, he said.\n",
      "Part of the money would also go to the requirements of the blended learning program of the Department of Education (DepEd) under the new normal, he added.\n",
      "Cayetano stressed that while Bayanihan 1 or the We Heal as One Law was very general and broad in its language, the House wants Bayanihan 2 to be more detailed.\n",
      "“For example, we don’t want to allocate funds for tourism in general. We want to be more specific. Is the money for facilities, infrastructure, or is it for training of tourist guides? But we are also discussing some flexibility for the executive branch,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that a few hundred million COVID-19 vaccine doses could be produced by the end of the year – and be targeted at those most vulnerable to the virus.\n",
      "The UN health agency said it was working on that assumption, with a view to two billion doses by the end of 2021, as pharmaceutical firms rush to find a vaccine.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said researchers were working on more than 200vaccine candidates around the world, including 10 that are in human testing.\n",
      "“If we’re very lucky, there will be one or two successful candidates before the end of this year,” she told a virtual press conference.\n",
      "She identified three groups most in need of the first wave of vaccine doses.\n",
      "They are front-line workers with high exposure, such as medics and police officers; those most vulnerable to the disease, such as the elderly and diabetics; and people in high-transmission settings, such as urban slums and care homes.“You have to start with the most vulnerable and then progressively vaccinate more people,” Swaminathan said.\n",
      "“We are working on the assumption that we may have a couple of hundred mil – lion doses at the end of this year, very optimistically,” she said.\n",
      "“We’re hoping that in 2021 we will have two billion doses of one, two or three effective vaccines to be dis – tributed around the world. But there’s a big ‘if’ there, because we don’t yet have any vaccine that’s proven.“But because of all the investments going into this, let’s say we have two billion doses by the end of 2021 – we should be able to vaccinate at least these priority populations.”\n",
      "Pharmaceutical compa – ny executives said late last month that one or several COVID-19 vaccines could be – gin rolling out before 2021, but warned that an estimated total of 15 billion doses would be needed to suppress the virus.\n",
      "Swaminathan said scien – tists were analyzing 40,000 sequences of the new coro – navirus and while all viruses mutate, this one was doing so far less than influenza, and had not yet mutated in the key areas that would alter the severity of disease or the immune response.\n",
      "Lower immunity\n",
      "People who catch COVID19 but don’t show symptoms may have significantly lower levels of immunity against the virus than those who become severely ill, new research showed Thursday.\n",
      "The majority of virus pa – tients display relatively minor signs of infection, and a small proportion show no symptoms at all.\n",
      "Very little is known about this group, given that they are far less likely to be tested than those who go on to develop severe symptoms including respiratory problems.\n",
      "Researchers based in Chi – na compared two groups of individuals infected with COVID-19 in Chongqing’s Wanzhou district: 37 who showed symptoms versus 37 who did not.\n",
      "The researchers analyzed blood samples from both groups taken a few weeks after recovering and found that just 62.2 percent of the asymptomatic group had short-term antibodies, com – pared with 78.4 percent of symptomatic patients.\n",
      "After eight weeks of con – valescence, antibody pres – ence had fallen in 81.1 percent of asymptomatic patients, compared with 62.2 percent of symptomatic patients.\n",
      "What’s more, asymp – tomatic patients were found to have lower levels of 18 pro- anti-inflammatory cellsignaling proteins than the symptomatic group, suggesting a weaker immune response to the novel coronavirus.\n",
      "Authors of the study, which was published in Na – ture Medicine, said their findings called into question the idea that everyone who has had coronavirus are im – mune to future infection.\n",
      "“These data might indi – cate the risks of using COVID19 ‘immunity passports’ and support the prolongation of public health interventions, including social distancing, hygiene, isolation of highrisk groups and widespread testing,” they wrote.\n",
      "Danny Altmann, a spokes – man for British Society for Immunology as well as pro – fessor of Immunology at Imperial College London, said the research raised a vital question for combating COVID-19.\n",
      "“Much immunology data so far has come from analyz – ing the sickest, hospitalized patients, but most people who have been more mildly affected will want to know whether this is likely to have conferred lasting, protective immunity,” he said.\n",
      "Altmann said it was “an important and potentially worrying point” that many patients in the study showed a significant decline in antibody levels in just two months.\n",
      "“Though this is quite a small sample size of patients, it is in line with some con – cerns that natural immunity to coronaviruses can be quite short-lived,” said Altmann, who was not involved in the research. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "In his public address on state television Friday, the President said Moderna has entered the final stage of testing to determine the efficacy of its potential vaccine. He noted that vaccine supply will be limited unless the US company shares the technology and “gives it free to everybody.”“The earliest that mayroon na sila, they are in the final stage of testing, ang Moderna. It’s Moderna, it’s a US — pero it’s backed up by several… Mukhang mauna ito sila and they say mid-summer available na (The earliest that they can have, they are in the final stage of testing.

America has something like 314 million population. It won’t be enough unless well, if they share the technology, give it for free for everybody),” he said.\n",
      "Moderna recently announced that it was preparing for the third phase of its trials on the coronavirus vaccine candidate dubbed mRNA-1273 by next month. The company was reportedly the first to start human testing with its potential vaccine.\n",
      "The President, meantime, appealed anew to the public observe the health precautions such as wearing of face mask, frequent hand washing, and safe distancing from others. The country is currently placed under community quarantine at varying levels to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease.“Remember when you go out, (wear a face) mask,” the President told the nation.\n",

      "Sanofi Pasteur Philippines said that it is still in the “early stage” of developing a vaccine for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and that its vaccine availability will not likely to happen within a year.(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Sanofi Pasteur Philippines Country Manager Dr. Jean Antoine Zinsou said that they are not yet at the stage of having clinical trials “involving volunteers.”“We are at the early stage of the development of our vaccine and it is not only later on that we’re gonna have some study involving individuals to test the immunogenicity of this candidate vaccine, and also to assess the safety and efficacy of this vaccine. But we won’t get there before next year,” Zinsou told reporters on Friday.\n",
      "“Based on our projections, we can be confident enough in saying that within 18 to 24 months we should have a vaccine ready for registration,” he added.\n",
      "Zinsou said that it is important not to “raise too much hope” on the vaccine’s development as there are “a lot of uncertainties along the way.”\n",
      "“It’s our responsibility not to raise too much hope. We need to be honest with the timelines. We need to acknowledge the fact that there are uncertainties, but at the same time, we are developing this vaccine but we are also developing manufacturing capacity –and that is our part of the work,” he said.“We are dealing with biologicals. It means we are dealing with living materials which are viruses. Yes, we can project some timelines but there is no guarantee because we don’t know how the virus will react. When you develop a vaccine, there is always a risk of failure,” he added.\n",
      "Zinsou said that they are already in partnership with their rival, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), for the vaccine development for COVID-19.\n",
      "If they succeed in developing the vaccine, Zinsou said that they are eyeing to produce 600 million to one billion doses per year in order to “match the international requirement and there is no reason on our side to leave any country who will need it aside.”“The world is open to this numerous number of candidate vaccines because we know out of this hundreds of vaccines that are [being] developed, only a few will reach the safety and efficacy requirement to be put on the market,” he said.\n",
      "While the vaccine is being developed, Zinsou suggested that countries should start identifying how the vaccine will be administered to a specific population that is considered “more at risk.”\n",
      "“Each country needs to have a clear picture of epidemiological situations to define which population is more at risk and which population should be prioritized when the vaccine is available. Because we know, we won’t be able to vaccinate everybody at the same time. So, we will have to define who needs to be prioritized,” he said.\n",
      "“It is up to the country to define these parameters and to get prepared to implement a vaccination program,” added Zinsou. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "In his televised public address, the President said China has started to develop a potential coronavirus vaccine and may be able to distribute the drug by September.“Everybody has a God. Just pray that the vaccine — ang target nila (their target) is November — ah, September. September, I think China will be able to distribute, if I’m not mistaken. And the other countries are catching up. Everybody is at it so they are really trying their very best,” he said.\n",
      "“Kaya lang itong China hindi ito hambog. Wala itong ere. (China is not arrogant. It is not boastful.) Tut they, you know, they work and I’m very sure that they will be the first one — one of the countries that would be able to come up with a vaccine,” he added.\n",
      "The President earlier said he was looking for funds to purchase the coronavirus vaccine once it is made available. He said many countries were on the verge of discovering a vaccine for the illness that has infected millions of people across the world.\n",
      "But until the vaccine is discovered, the President appealed anew to the public to observe the health precautions, including mask-wearing and physical distancing. He told the public to remain vigilant as the community quarantine remains in effect in the country to cub the spread of the coronavirus.“Remember the COVID microbes are still in the air that you breathe, that you pass on to your fellowmen if you are not ready or willing to wear the mask. It is precisely — this is the protection, not for you if you do not want it, but for the protection of the other guy,” he said.\n",
      "Duterte earlier approved the recommendation to place Metro Manila and several areas under the more relaxed general community quarantine (GCQ) by June 1. Other places in the country, he added, will shift to the modified GCQ next month.\n",
      "The President meantime defended the government’s authority to impose restrictions on the movement of people while the quarantine is in effect. He said the state has “every right to control your movement if you pass on a contagion to the population.”“For you to pass the virus, if you get it from one place and from another person and pass it to the other guy, that’s different. That is where the right of the state comes in so that to prevent a mass contagion,” he said.\n",
      "“That is the reason of the essence of the police power of the state, to come up with measures to protect public interest, public health, public safety,” he added.\n",
      "As the country battles the pandemic, Duterte also said the government must also keep peace and order to prevent anarchy in the streets. He said citizens must obey laws or else face consequences for breaking them.\n",
      "“People trying to seize other people’s property or things like just being into a state of anarchy, the state has the right to come in and kkrrkk — put a stop on it. That is the survival of the Republic of the Philippines,” he said.\n",

      "A vaccine against COVID-19 is crucial to end the pandemic and to save lives and livelihoods. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is playing an important role in funding and speed¬ing up the development of COVID-19 vaccine candidates on a global basis.That is why Nestlé is supporting CEPI’s efforts with a donation of CHF 1 million (US$ 1.03 million). CEPI is working quickly and collaboratively with the ambition to develop a safe, effective and globally accessible COVID-19 vaccine within a 12-18- month timeframe.\n",
      "They have already raised over $1 billion from governments, private donors and individuals around the world but need further funding to reach their goal of USD 2 billon to allow their COVID-19 programs to continue at pace.\n",
      "Mark Schneider, CEO of Nestlé, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has created a lot of pain and hardship in communities around the world. A safe and effective vaccine will be needed to return to normality. That is why it was important to us to get on board when CEPI issued their call. We hope others will join us and support this important mission.”\n",

      "The President said Moderna pharmaceutical firm has developed the vaccine that may become available by January 2021, adding that people should avoid dying until then.“I’m looking for money to — balikan ko ulit dito kasi nag-usapan — nag-usapan tayo ng pera na may pera ako pangbili ng (I’d like to go back since we’re talking about money, I need money to buy) vaccine just in case somebody else would beat the Moderna to the vaccine. I think China has already won. We are just waiting for the announcement,” Duterte said during his televised public address Tuesday.\n",

      "He admitted that the government has limited resources since it is “short of tax collection” amid the coronavirus lockdown.\n",
      "The President welcomed the latest milestone in the global race for the coronavirus vaccine, citing that clinical trial of Moderna’s drug yielded “positive results.” He admitted that this was the “good news” he has been hoping for.“Mayroon ng vaccine but ang problema it will be ready, according to them, by 2021 pa. January at the very — at the earliest. So kung ganoon ‘wag ka sanang mamatay hanggang January, hintayin mo ‘yung vaccine (There is a vaccine ut the problem is it will be ready, according to them, by 2021. January at the very earliest.

      "Duterte also cited that many countries are “on the ‘verge” of developing the drugs or vaccines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus disease. “Judging from the COVID started up to now, I’m sure they made a lot of progress in finding the vaccine,” he said.\n",

      "US biotech firm Moderna reported promising early results from a clinical test of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine\n",
      "The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said the vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, appeared to produce an immune response in eight people who received it similar to that seen in people convalescing from the virus.“These interim Phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection,” said Moderna’s chief medical officer Tal Zaks.\n",
      "“These data substantiate our belief that mRNA-1273 has the potential to prevent COVID-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials,” Zaks said.\n",
      "President Donald Trump welcomed the news saying “it’s incredible what they can do and I’ve seen results.\n",
      "“And the results are staggeringly good,” Trump told reporters. “So I’m very happy and the market’s up very big.”Wall Street stocks posted substantial gains on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 3.85 percent and the S&P 500 up 3.15 percent.\n",
      "Moderna shares gained 19.96 percent to close at $80.00 in New York.\n",
      "Moderna, which was founded nine years ago, said the vaccine “was generally safe and well tolerated” and that patients suffered no more than redness or soreness from the shots.In a conference call, Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said the preliminary tests inspired confidence that mRNA-1273 has “a high probability to provide protection” against the virus.\n",
      "“We could not be happier about these interim data,” Bancel said of the Phase 1 test, the first of three in the development of a vaccine.\n",
      "Separate tests performed on mice showed that the vaccine prevented the virus from replicating in their lungs, according to the company.\n",
      "The US government has invested nearly half a billion dollars in the development of Moderna’s vaccine candidate.\n",
      "It is being developed in a partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease headed by Anthony Fauci and the clinical test was carried out by the National Institutes of Health.– ‘As fast as safely possible’ –\n",
      "Three groups of 15 patients aged 18 to 55 received three different doses of the vaccine in the Phase 1 test, the complete results of which are not yet known.\n",
      "The Phase 2 trial, with 600 subjects, has already received the green light from the US Food and Drug Administration and Moderna said they should begin this quarter.\n",
      "A Phase 3 trial, the largest and most important to validate the efficacy of a vaccine, should begin in July.\n",
      "“The Moderna team continues to focus on moving as fast as safely possible to start our pivotal Phase 3 study in July,” said Bancel, Moderna’s CEO.\n",
      "Based on the Phase 1 partial results, Moderna said they would no longer study the highest dose since the lower doses appeared to provide some effect.\n",
      "“The lower the dose, the more people we expect to be able to protect,” said Moderna president Stephen Hoge.\n",
      "Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that while it was difficult to be sure of the results “from a press release,” there was reason for optimism.\n",
      "“It must be noted that this is a Phase 1 study which has an object of showing the vaccine is able to induce an antibody response and that the dose range is appropriate,” Evans said.\n",
      "“It will not be until the Phase 3 trial is completed that it will be known whether the vaccine actually prevents COVID-19 disease,” he added.\n",
      "Trump has said he wants 300 million vaccine doses by January 2021 to protect the US population and his administration has provided funding to Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and France’s Sanofi.\n",
      "The development of a vaccine usually takes years but the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused more than 315,000 deaths, has given unprecedented urgency to the search.\n",
      "A dozen clinical trials are taking place around the world, half of them in China, according to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\n",
      "China has said that it is carrying out tests on humans of five experimental vaccines.\n",
      "The challenge is not only finding a safe and efficient vaccine but also producing billions of doses.\n",
      "Several large laboratories, including Moderna, have said they would immediately begin production of an eventual vaccine even before the completion of all of the clinical trials.\n",
      "Moderna recently announced a partnership with the giant drugmaker Lonza to boost its manufacturing capacity to up to one billion doses a year. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Norway will give $1 billion to support the distribution worldwide of any vaccine developed against COVID-19 as well as for vaccines against other diseases, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Monday.\n",
      "Oslo made the pledge as part of a donor conference held on Monday by the European Union to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.23 billion) towards the testing, treatment and prevention of the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Non-EU member Norway is a co-chair of the event as a long-standing donor to global health initiatives.\n",
      "“This is a global problem that needs common solutions between countries, not least with distribution, so that everyone gets access to the vaccine,” Solberg told Reuters in an interview ahead of the conference.\n",
      "The $1 billion will go to GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, a global partnership of private and public organizations focusing on immunisation worldwide, as direct funding for the period 2021-2030. Norway has financed GAVI since its inception in 2000.\n",
      "Solberg said she regretted the United States, a close ally of Norway, had stopped funding the World Health Organization (WHO) and that it was not part of Monday’s initiative, which also includes Canada, Japan and Saudi Arabia, the current chair of the G20 group of nations.“It is a pity the U.S. is not a part of it. When you are in a crisis, you manage it and you do it jointly with others,” Solberg said.\n",
      "“Everyone will certainly evaluate their work at some point and see what could have been done differently,” she said. “But you do this afterwards, not when you are in the middle of it.”\n",
      "Oslo will also give an additional 50 million crowns ($4.8 million) to the WHO to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic, on top of its normal funding to the U.N. agency.Norway has already announced 2.2 billion crowns in funding to the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), set up to fight emerging epidemics by funding the development of new vaccines.\n",
      "She said it was also in the interest of western nations to help developing nations with their coronavirus response to prevent longer-term problems.\n",
      "“Without the medicine and the (possible) vaccine, there will be bigger economic setbacks, bigger security and environmental challenges, as well as migration challenges,” she said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año on May 3, Sunday, stressed that the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) has prevented the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) from claiming more lives.\n",
      "Año attributed the surge of COVID-19 cases in the country despite the implementation of the ECQ to improved testing capacity, which is now estimated at 6,300 per day.\n",
      "Department of Interior and Local Government\n",
      "(DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año\n",
      "(PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)Earlier, the DILG chief said the ECQ may be relaxed when the country’s COVID-19 testing capacity reaches 30,000 per day.\n",
      "Despite public grumblings, Año appealed for understanding imploring people that the ECQ has slowed down the spread of COVID-19.\n",
      "Depending on how things proceed, he said, the President would then decide if the ECQ can be lifted or extended beyond May 15.\n",
      "In the event it gets lifted, Año asserted the public should adjust to the policies under the so-called “new normal” to avoid a recurrence of the deadly virus.He believes that the decision to lift the ECQ and the general community quarantine (GCQ) in low-risk areas will be based on how the public adapts to this “new normal.”\n",
      "Under this “new normal,” Año said the public should get used to regularly wearing face masks in public, observing physical distancing, and hygienic practices.\n",
      "He noted that this should be observed until a COVID-19 vaccine is discovered.\n",
      "In an interview with ANC, he cited the case of Singapore, where COVID-19 cases ballooned when its government thought that they already had the virus under control.\n",
      "In late April, Singapore had a daily surge record of more than 1,400 COVID-19 cases, with most of the new infections linked to dormitories housing foreign laborers. Año noted that Singapore initially kept the viral pandemic in check with its strict testing and contact-tracing.\n",
      "But as its government thought everything was under control, anti-COVID guidelines were relaxed, which resulted to a fast-moving second wave of cases.\n",
      "The DILG chief noted that the country should be wary of being complacent as things may worsen if the “new normal” policies are not enforced. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "As the global cases of coronavirus topped over three million since the outbreak was confirmed in China late last year, dozens of laboratories around the world have been working on finding both a treatment and vaccine to stop the further spread of the disease.\n",
      "As of April 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 102 candidate COVID-19 vaccines in development globally.Of the 102 potential vaccines, only eight are currently in clinical evaluation, while 94 are still in the pre-clinical trial stage.\n",
      "Clinical trials, WHO explained, involve research on new tests and treatments and evaluates effects of these on humans.\n",
      "China’s CanSino Biological Inc., in partnership with the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, has a candidate vaccine currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. The vaccine is based on the same platform as the Ebola virus disease.\n",
      "United States drugmaker Pfizer, in partnership with Germany’s BioNtech and other pharmaceutical companies, are in Phases 1 and 2 trials.Also in Phases 1 and 2 is a vaccine developed by England’s University of Oxford. Scientists had already used the same platform directed against various infections, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza, tuberculosis, Chikungunya, Zika, and meningitis B.\n",
      "Currently in phase 1 are potential vaccines developed by United States-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna, as well as vaccine candidates sponsored and developed by China’s Wuhan Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm, Beijing Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm, and Sinovac.\n",
      "There are four phases of biomedical clinical trials, according to WHO.Phase 1 tests new drugs for the first time in a small group of people to evaluate a safe dosage range and identify side effects.\n",
      "Phase 2 involves testing treatments that have been found to be safe in Phase 1 but need a larger group of human subjects to monitor for any adverse effects.\n",
      "During Phase 3, tests are conducted on larger populations and in different regions and countries, and are often the step right before a new treatment is approved.\n",
      "Lastly, during Phase 4, studies take place after a country approval has been secured, but there is a need for further testing in a wide population over a longer period.\n",
      "Scientists have been saying that it may take about 12 to 18 months before a vaccine can be approved for mass use.Realizing the urgent need to stop the spread of infection in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has earlier promised to give P50 million, from an initial P10 million, to Filipino scientists who can develop a vaccine against the coronavirus disease.\n",
      "The country has already recorded almost 9,000 cases of COVID-19 three months after the first case was reported in January 30.\n",
      "Testing existing drugs\n",
      "While it seems that it may take a little longer to find a vaccine, scientists are hoping to find a cure for COVID-19 soon.\n",
      "Leading a team of Philippine experts taking part in the WHO’s solidarity trial is Dr. Marissa Alejandria of the University of the Philippines-College of Medicine and president of the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.\n",
      "The solidarity trial is an international randomized and adoptive clinical trial to test the safety and effectiveness of four possible therapies in treating COVID-19, according to the Philippines’ Department of Health (DOH).\n",
      "The DOH announced last April 22 the participation of the Philippines among more than 100 countries in the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of antiviral drug Ebola virus, Remdesivir; antimalarial drug, Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine; antiretroviral drugs used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), Lopinavir with Ritonavir; and multiple sclerosis treatment, Lopinavir with Ritonavir plus Interferon beta-1a.\n",
      "“There is currently no magic drug or known treatment for COVID-19 and there is an urgency to find effective treatment,” DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said.\n",
      "“The drugs included in this trial are largely untested against SARS-COV 2 virus that causes COVID-19, and more robust data is needed,” she added.\n",
      "The testing will be conducted in at least 20 Level 3 hospitals nationwide.\n",
      "In a report by CNN Philippines, hospitals that will be joining the “mega trial” are Philippine General Hospital (Manila), The Medical City (Pasig City), San Lazaro Hospital (Manila), Lung Center of the Philippines (Quezon City), Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (Muntinlupa City), Baguio General Hospital (Benguet), East Avenue Medical Center (Quezon City), Makati Medical Center (Makati City), St. Luke’s Medical Center Global City (Taguig), St. Luke’s Medical Center (Quezon City), University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center (Quezon City), Cardinal Santos Medical Center (San Juan), Manila Doctors Hospital (Manila), Manila Medical Center (Manila), Chinese General Hospital (Manila), San Juan de Dios Medical Center (Pasay City), Diliman Doctors Hospital (Quezon City), University of Santo Tomas Hospital (Manila), Vicente Sotto Medical Center (Cebu City), Southern Philippines Medical Center (Davao City), and World Citi Medical Center (Quezon City).\n",
      "WHO said that based on emerging evidence, other drugs can be added.\n",
      "However, until there is sufficient evidence, WHO cautions against physicians and medical associations recommending or administering these unproven patients with COVID-19 or people self-medicating with them. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Currently, there are six “vaccine candidates” that are being developed worldwide, WHO acting country representative for the Philippines Socorro Escalante said in a virtual presser with the Department of Health (DOH).\n",
      "While these candidate vaccines are undergoing research and development, Escalante said the government can take advantage of the time to polish regulatory processes and formulate vaccine strategy.\n",
      "“I think the country could take advantage of the vaccines that are now in the pipeline, but what is key for the country is to be able to prepare its regulatory processes… Because the vaccine development will really take time. For the meantime, we encourage the country to prepare its regulatory processes in terms of assessment and evaluation of the vaccine,” Escalante said.\n",
      "This is to fast-track the process of receiving and registering the vaccines developed by other countries.\n",
      "The WHO official also emphasized that the country should formulate strategies on the vaccine’s deployment “depending on how we are going to prioritize the vaccine to the more susceptible population.”\n",
      "“Dahil kapag nagawa na ‘yung bakuna, hindi natin mababakunahan lahat ng tao at the same time, so ‘yung gobyerno kailangan ding gumawa ng (because when the vaccine is already available, we won’t be able to vaccinated everybody at the same time, so the government needs to formulate) vaccine strategy particularly by prioritizing more healthcare workers or ‘yung may comorbidities,” Escalante added.\n",
      "The process to develop a vaccine to counter COVID-19 is “highly technical and tedious” as it may take a year to a year-and-a-half before it can be declared safe and effective.\n",
      "“There are steps that scientists and experts must follow to be able to develop the vaccines,” Escalante said.\n",
      "The first stage, which can last up to six months, is where the experts identify potential candidates for the vaccine. Clinical trials with three phases will then follow to test the vaccines on animals to determine their safety and efficacy.\n",
      "“Then, the vaccine will be registered [with the] national regulation authority of a country for another evaluation. It will be given marketing authorization and could finally be used, but this period is actually the phase 4 of clinical trial where the vaccine needs to be monitored in terms of safety,” Escalante explained.\n",
      "If the Philippines opts to develop a vaccine on its own in the future, the country must first prepare for local production capacity, particularly technology, the WHO official said.\n",
      "“I think the Philippines has experts and scientists that are world-class, and we also have institutions to be able to undertake research and development, but the technology has to be really adapted to the vaccine development.\n",
      "“The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine is capable but on a small scale. [A] laboratory for testing [the] quality and safety of the vaccine must also be developed,” Escalante said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Macron, Merkel, Ramaphosa, and Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were among those voicing strong support to WHO.\n",
      "Macron urged all G7 and G20 countries to get behind the initiative, adding: “And I hope we’ll manage to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the U.S., because this is about saying ‘the fight against COVID-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle’.”\n",

This is a large-scale international clinical trial to investigate and identify effective drugs that can be used to treat COVID-19.The trial involves four treatment options: the investigational antiviral Remdesivir, antimalarial drug Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine, antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV Lopinavir with Ritonavir, and Lopinavir with Ritonavirplus Interferon beta-1a.\n",

That’s an improvement from April 13, when the WHO said there were 70 vaccines in development, with three candidates in human trials.\n",

      "In Germany, the green light was also given for human trials of potential coronavirus vaccines developed by German biotech company BioNTech, which is racing teams in Germany, the US, and China to develop an agent that will stop the pandemic.The trial in Germany will be initially conducted on 200 healthy people, with more subjects, including some at higher risk from the disease, to be included in a second stage, German vaccines regulator the Paul Ehrlich Institut said on Wednesday.\n",
      "BioNTech said it was developing four vaccine candidates under a programme named BNT162 with its partner, pharma giant Pfizer.\n",
      "Tests of the vaccine were also planned in the United States, once regulatory approval for testing on humans had been secured there.\n",
      "BioNTech, which awarded the rights in China to BNT162 to Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical under a March collaboration deal, is competing with Germany’s CureVac and US biotech firm Moderna in the race to develop messenger-RNA vaccines.These molecules act as recipes that instruct human cells to produce antigen proteins, which allow the immune system to develop an arsenal against future coronavirus infections.\n",
      "Moderna started testing its experimental vaccine on humans in March.\n",
      "Two different experimental coronavirus vaccines were approved for human tests by China last week. A unit of Sinovac Biotech and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products are developing these compounds.In March, China gave the greenlight for another clinical trial for a vaccine candidate developed by the Academy of Military Medical Sciences and biotech firm CanSino Bio .\n",

      "Meanwhile, the head of the US agency in charge of developing a vaccine against coronavirus said Wednesday that he was removed from his job for opposing the chloroquine treatment promoted by President Donald Trump.\n",
      "Dr. Rick Bright said he was removed on Tuesday as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the government agency for developing and procuring treatments and vaccines, and moved to a lesser position in the National Institutes of Health.\n",
      "“I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the COVID-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,” he said in a statement to US media.He said the move was a direct response to his resistance to “misguided directives” to support the use of malaria treatments chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus.\n",
      "Those treatments, he said, were “promoted by the administration as a panacea,” but “clearly lack scientific merit”.\n",
      "“While I am prepared to look at all options and to think ‘outside the box’ for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.”\n",
      "Since mid-March Trump, backed by the conservative Fox News channel, has advocated for the use of chloroquine to treat COVID-19 infections, with scant evidence from studies of its safety or effectiveness.\n",
      "Despite his own science advisors suggesting more study is needed, Trump repeatedly pushed for the drugs’ use, claiming the treatment could be a “gift from God” to counter the coronavirus pandemic.\n",

      "GENEVA – The novel coronavirus is 10 times more deadly than swine flu, which caused a global pandemic in 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Monday, stressing a vaccine would be necessary to fully halt transmission.\n",
      "The WHO said there are 70 coronavirus vaccines in development globally, with three candidates already being tested in human trials, as drugmakers race to find a cure for the deadly pathogen.\n",
      "A logo is pictured on the headquarters of the World Health Orgnaization\n",
      "(WHO) ahead of a meeting of the Emergency Committee on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Geneva, Switzerland, January 30, 2020. (REUTERS / Denis Balibouse / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)The furthest along in the clinical process is an experimental vaccine developed by Hong Kong-listed CanSino Biologics Inc. and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, which is in phase 2.\n",
      "The other two being tested in humans are treatments developed separately by US drugmakers Moderna Inc. and Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., according to a WHO document.\n",
      "Progress is occurring at unprecedented speed in developing vaccines as the infectious pathogen looks unlikely to be stamped out through containment measures alone.\n",
      "The drug industry is hoping to compress the time it takes to get a vaccine to market — usually about 10 to 15 years — to within the next year.Drugmakers big and small have jumped in to try to develop a vaccine, which would be the most effective way to contain the virus. Pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer Inc. and Sanofi have vaccine candidates in the preclinical stages, according to the WHO document.\n",
      "CanSino said last month it received Chinese regulatory approval to start human trials of its vaccine.\n",
      "Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna — which has never put out a product — received regulatory approval to move quickly to human trials in March, skipping the years of animal trials that are the norm in developing vaccines. Inovio began its human trials last week.Decelerating slowly\n",
      "WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from Geneva that the organization was constantly learning about the new virus sweeping the globe, which has now killed nearly 115,000 people and infected over 1.8 million.\n",
      "“We know that COVID-19 spreads fast, and we know that it is deadly, 10 times deadlier than the 2009 flu pandemic,” he said.\n",
      "WHO says 18,500 people died of “swine flu” (H1N1), which was first uncovered in Mexico and the United States in March 2009, but the Lancet medical estimated the toll to be between 151,700 and 575,400.\n",
      "The Lancet review included estimated deaths in Africa and SoutheastAsia that were not accounted for by the WHO.\n",
      "The outbreak, which was declared a pandemic in June 2009 and considered over by August 2010, turned out to be not as deadly as first feared. Vaccines were rushed out, but in hindsight, the West, particularly Europe, and the WHO were criticized for overreacting at a time when annual influenza epidemics every year killed between 250,000 and 500,000 people, according to WHO.\n",
      "Tedros lamented Monday that some countries are seeing a doubling of cases every three to four days, but stressed that if countries were committed to “early case finding, testing, isolating (and) caring for every case and tracing every contact” they could rein in the virus.\n",
      "More than half of the planet’s population is currently staying home as part of efforts to stem the spread of the virus, but Tedros warned that “our global connectedness means the risk of re-introduction and resurgence of the disease will continue”.\n",
      "He pointed out that while COVID-19 had accelerated quickly, “it decelerates much more slowly.”\n",
      "“In other words, the way down is much slower than the way up,” he said, stressing that “control measures must be lifted slowly, and with control. It cannot happen all at once.”\n",
      "“Control measures can only be lifted if the right public health measures are in place, including significant capacity for contact tracing,” he said.\n",
      "Regardless of the efforts put in place, the WHO acknowledged that “ultimately, the development and delivery of a safe and effective vaccine will be needed to fully interrupt transmission.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The public health crisis stemming from the coronavirus pandemic could last for two years if a vaccine is not discovered soon, President Duterte admitted Thursday (April 9).\n",
      "According to the President, only a vaccine could put an end to the pandemic that has infected more than million people.\n",
      "President Rodrigo Roa Duterte\n",
      "(PCCO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "“COVID, anong sagot? Vaccine. Walang vaccine? COVID stays. Iyan ang totoo. Ibigay ko sa inyo ang totoo,” Duterte said in a taped public address past midnight.\n",
      "(What’s the answer to COVID? Vaccine. No vaccine? COVID stays. That’s the true. I’m giving you the truth.)\n",
      "“Sabihin ko sa inyo. Think of the COVID ganitong sitwasyon, tatakbo ito ng two years.” (I tell you. Think of the COVID situation, this will last for two years.)\n",
      "Duterte, who recently ordered the extension of the Luzon-wide lockdown until the end of April, admitted that people will suffer if no vaccine is discovered to address the pandemic. The government earlier forecasted zero economic growth for the year due to the severe blow of the pandemic on the country.\n",
      "“Kasi pagka hindi ito naayos, ang COVID, mapurnada talaga tayong lahat,” Duterte said.\n",
      "(If COVID is not resolved, we will all fail.)\n",
      "The President also claimed that he saw the health crisis coming and took pride that he was the first to declare a lockdown to curb the spread of the disease. He said he has been closely following the COVID story and studying the matter.\n",
      "The enhanced community quarantine in Luzon began last March 17, a day after Duterte ordered a sweeping quarantine in Metro Manila that will be extended from April 12 to April 30 to curb the spread of the outbreak and give government more time to improve healthcare efforts to combat the disease.\n",
      "“Ito nakikita ko na noon pa. Itong COVID na ito, sinusundan ko talaga ‘yan. Kasi sinasabi, come Johnny — ah come-Jimmy-lately [Johnny-come-lately] — hindi ho — ako ang pinakaunang lahat nag-lockdown, kasi nasusundan ko na ang istorya,” he said.\n",
      "(I saw it coming then. I’ve been following the COVID stories. They were saying I was a Johnny-come-lately, but it’s not true. I was actually the first to order a lockdown because I was following the story.)\n",
      "“At sabi ko, nagbabasa naman ako different sources of knowledge — Facebook, everything — lahat na ng what I can get my hands on to study the matter because Presidente ako. Dumating nga.”\n",
      "(I was reading different sources of knowledge – Facebook, everything. Everything I can get my hands on to study the matter because I’m the President. And it actually arrived.)\n",
      "As the number of the country’s cases of infections soared daily, Duterte assured the public that his government is taking steps to address the public health emergency and mitigate its impact on the economy and the people.\n",
      "He said the government’s economic team would look for additional funds, including borrowing from lenders, to boost the government’s COVID response, including relief program for the affected sectors. He saw no problem with the borrowing program because the country has good credit standing.\n",
      "“Marunong tayong maghiram at marunong tayong magbayad on time,” Duterte said.\n",
      "(We know how to borrow and we know how to pay on time)\n",
      "“So magkano utang natin (So how much do we owe)? Well, it could be — it could go into trillions,” he added.\n",
      "Earlier, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said the economic team has put together a P1.17 trillion program to boost healthcare, provide aid sectors affected by the outbreak, and stimulate the local economy.\n",
      "He said the Central Bank provided P830 billion in liquidity for the economy. They also plan to borrow US$5.6 billion from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to raise additional funds.\n",
      "Dominguez also said the economy may have zero growth this year as the coronavirus has hit the country “in a very hard way.” The massive public spending to combat the pandemic may also bloat the budget deficit to 5.3 percent from 3.2 percent, he added.\n",
      "“We are confident ho na we have the financial capability to bridge this problem of the — the COVID has brought us,” Dominguez said in the same public briefing as the President.\n",
      "“So the program is to spend — first, to help the poorest families, and then to help the small and medium enterprises, and then to provide support for the companies that are supported by their banks,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "Medicago, a Canada-based company, announced that it now focuses on developing a plant-based vaccine against coronavirus disease which it hopes to submit for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration very soon.\n",
      "Medicago said it successfully produced a Virus-Like Particle (VLP) of the coronavirus just 20 days after receiving the genetic sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2), the virus responsible for COVID-19.\n",
      "This is the breakthrough first step in developing a vaccine.Medicago already uses a plant-based technology to develop vaccines for seasonal flu, but is now working on developing a vaccine for COVID-19.\n",
      "Instead of working with live virus in chicken eggs as a bioreactor, Medicago uses tobacco plants in what it describes as a faster and more efficient process of producing proteins.\n",
      "The company said that using tobacco plants and genetically engineered agrobacteria works faster than using eggs.\n",
      "It also makes the vaccine easier to produce at scale. The company believes that tobacco plants are “highly efficient at producing proteins of varying complexity, serving as mini-factories for our vaccines.”With its plant-based technology, Medicago researchers insert a genetic sequence into agrobacterium, a soil bacteria, which is taken up by the subject plant Nicotiana benthamiana—known as a close relative to tobacco.\n",
      "The plant develops the protein that can be used as a vaccine.\n",
      "“The pace of our initial progress in COVID-19 is attributable to the capability of our plant-based platform which is able to produce vaccine and antibody solutions to counteract this global public health threat. The ability to produce a candidate vaccine within 20 days after obtaining the gene is a critical differentiator for our proven technology. This technology enables scale-up at unprecedented speed to potentially combat COVID-19.” said Dr. Bruce Clark, CEO of Medicago.Medicago researchers discovered that tobacco, with its ideal big leaves, is much better as a subject plant because it is hearty and grows quickly.\n",
      "Clinical grade plant material can be produced in a little more than a month.\n",
      "The company believes the process is a better way to cultivate the vaccine.\n",
      "Medicago has a 97,000-square-foot greenhouse in North Carolina where it grows Nicotiana benthamiana—a flowering plant endemic to Australia and known as close relative to Nicotiana tabacum or tobacco plant.\n",
      "The company grows the plants in Durham’s Research Triangle Park, the leading and largest high-technology research and science park in North America, not for cigarette production but for use in testing and development of the seasonal flu vaccine.Amid the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Medicago decided to focus on the development of COVID-19 vaccine this time.\n",
      "Medicago researchers said if the virus begins to mutate, as is expected for COVID-19, they can update the production using new plants.\n",
      "In its announcement, Medicago said it will initiate preclinical testing for safety and efficacy of the vaccine.\n",
      "If approved by the FDA, the company expects to begin human trials by July or August.\n",
      "Medicago said it also began using its technology platform to develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in collaboration with the Laval University’s Infectious Disease Research Centre.\n",
      "The antibodies could potentially be used to treat people infected by the virus.\n",
      "The university program is headed by Gary Kobinger, who helped develop a vaccine and treatment for Ebola.\n",
      "Medicago said it is great to develop something positive from a plant with a negative stigma such as tobacco.\n",
      "The potential of turning a plant that has been associated with harm to preserve life is a positive development.\n",
      "Medicago is a Quebec-based company that is partly owned by Philip Morris Investments, a part of Philip Morris International whose research, development and production signal a tectonic shift in its core business operation as it moves away from traditional cigarettes to heated tobacco products.\n",
      "Medicago’s application is pending FDA approval and will need to go through rigorous clinical trials.\n",
      "Medicago CEO Bruce Clark said that once approved, the company could produce as many as 10 million doses a month and the vaccine could become available by November 2021. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "More than 20 vaccines and a number of antiviral medicines are in development as the global pharmaceutical industry races against time to find cures and preventions for COVID-19, the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP) reported.\n",
      "As of today, PHAP said, there are at least 14 companies with a medicine for COVID-19 in early phase research, 4 companies with a medicine in Phase I of development and 3 in Phase II, and one company has a medicine in Phase III trials. A clinical trial is a carefully designed study which provides scientific information needed to weigh the benefits and risks of a new medication and decide whether it is safe for patients.PHAP President and MSD Philippines President Dr. Beaver Tamesis said the industry is also scaling up capacity of diagnostics for testing for COVID-19 patients. PHAP is a member of the Geneva-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA).\n",
      "Tamesis said the industry commits to accelerate its effort to use its skills, technology and resources to bring safe, effective diagnostics, treatments and vaccines to patients as a matter of urgency.\n",
      "“We are seeing an unprecedented response on the part of the pharmaceutical industry to help put an end to this pandemic. As a science driven sector, we are in the unique position to partner with the government and the healthcare community to support efforts in this time of health crisis. We support government efforts, and recognize the immense role of our healthcare workers and the people in the pharmaceutical sector who are dedicating and risking their lives to contain this pandemic,” said.\n",
      "On vaccine development, experts are hoping it will take as little as 12 to 18 months before there is a vaccine available. The IFPMA, representing the world’s leading biopharmaceutical companies, estimates that this is a best-case estimate that assumes one or two of the first few vaccines that enter development will be successful. In non-pandemic environments, only approximately one in ten experimental vaccines make it all the way through to regulatory approval.In its update, the IFPMA also said that there are nearly 80 clinical trials for experimental new treatments and vaccines in development for coronaviruses including COVID-19, Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia, SARS and MERS.\n",
      "The IFPMA said that pharmaceutical companies have also been manufacturing thousands of doses of investigational and previously approved medicines that could treat coronavirus for emergency use and for use in clinical trials around the globe, including compounds formerly tested on other viral pathogens such as Ebola and HIV. Potential treatments include both antiviral medicines and immunotherapies.\n",
      "Pharmaceutical companies that are undertaking massive research for COVID-19 treatments have presence in the Philippines. These are AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, and Takeda.Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies engaged in the research and development of vaccines operating in the Philippines are GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Sanofi.\n",
      "Rolling out diagnostics to detect whether patients are genuinely infected with the new coronavirus is a key step in preventing or slowing its spread. The pharmaceutical industry is also scaling up capacity of diagnostics for testing for COVID-19 patients as much as possible. Pharmaceutical companies Roche and Takeda, also present in the Philippines, are in the forefront of these efforts.\n",
      "Meanwhile, PHAP Members are working to ensure an unhampered movement of medicines throughout the country, calling on the government to facilitate policies that will aid them in the process.\n",
      "“We support government efforts to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. We continue our operations despite the challenges brought about by the enhanced community quarantine. PHAP Members are employing supply chain strategies so that medicines, vaccines and diagnostics needed by healthcare professionals and patients are available at the time they need them,” said PHAP Executive Director Teodoro Padilla.\n",
      "Padilla added that PHAP Members are also working to protect the health of the people in the pharmaceutical industry as they perform the critical task of ensuring medicine availability during public health emergencies.“The healthcare system is facing enormous pressure and we want to contribute by helping secure pharmaceutical supply chain, and by protecting the health of our people. The men and women in the pharmaceutical industry are front liners themselves, and we commend them for the work they do for us,” said Padilla. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "President Duterte is optimistic that Russia, the United States, and Japan could develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus disease “in a matter of days.”\n",
      "President Rodrigo Roa Duterte\n",
      "(TOTO LOZANO/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO/ MANILA BULLETIN)\n",
      "Amid the global outbreak of the coronavirus, the President said the best and brightest scientific minds are expected to work “overtime” for a potential vaccine.“With the great strides now of science, in a matter of days, I’m sure Russia — the brightest of the brightest — America, Japan, they are working overtime to come up with the vaccine,” Duterte said in an assembly of the country’s mayors in Pasay City.\n",
      "“It takes time pero kaya na ng mga mundo. Kaya na ng mga gobyerno (but the world has the capability. The governments are capable), especially those who are rich in technology,” he said.\n",
      "The coronavirus, which broke out in Wuhan, China, has spread to more than 100 countries including the Philippines in recent weeks. The global death toll has reached the 4,000 mark while more than 100,000 people have been infected.\n",
      "In the Philippines, at least 33 cases of coronavirus have been reported, including one fatality.The President has placed the country under a state of public health emergency, mobilizing government resources to step up the prevention and control of the spread of the coronavirus. Duterte has expressed confidence that the coronavirus will eventually be defeated.\n",
      "In his speech Tuesday, the President recognized that the coronavirus disease might stay “for a little while” but will eventually pass. “It’s here and I suppose it’s going to stay for a little while.”\n",
      "Duterte noted that the world has previously experienced “great cleansing” such as the bubonic plague and Spanish flu pandemic.“Speaking of contagion, I have noticed that every epoch there’s always a great cleansing of — not really cleansing dirt — but cleansing in the number of people in this planet,” he said.\n",
      "“The bubonic plague, mainly it is caused by the rodents or the rats, and the Spanish flu right — was it before or after the Second World War? I think it was during even the Second — the First World War rather. Mayroon talagang great spasm and marami…,” he added.\n",
      "The President remained unfazed by coronavirus threat as he continued to defy the Presidential Security Group’s (PSG) advice to adopt a “no touch policy” in his public engagements.\n",
      "“Kung hindi ka na umabot (If you don’t make it), that is really your destiny,” he said.\n",
      "“Hindi mo na madala ‘yan sa handshake-handshake. Maski magpunta ka ng limang milyon na handshake diyan, ‘pag hindi mo pa panahon, hindi mo talaga panahon. Ganun lang ‘yan,” he said.\n",
      "(You can’t contain it by limiting handshakes. Even if you had five million handshakes, if it’s not yet your time, it’s really not yet your time. That’s all it is),” he said.\n",
      "Duterte said in jest that he opposed the stricter security protocol because he might miss his chance to meet beautiful ladies at events.\n",
      "“Ang problema niyan, paano ‘yung magagandang babae nandito ngayon sa kwartong ito? (The problem is, how about the many beautiful women in this room now? It’s always nice to talk to a beautiful lady, corona or no corona, especially [when] she looks like a mutya (beauty queen) with a corona (crown) on her head,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "This development has the makings of a good book or even a movie.That is, if researchers find a way of using a puzzle game to create a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus.\n",
      "The game is called Foldit, a crowd-sourced puzzle where players need to fold proteins to alter the behavior of viruses and consequently prevent the spread of disease, an article for Mashable Southeast Asia (SEA) said.Is this purely the stuff of science fiction? Not quite, as the developers of the game just this week added COVID-19 as one of the puzzles thatplayers need to solve.\n",
      "It may be just a matter of time before someone sitting in front of the computer actually finds out a way of this current global threat that has already claimed thousands of lives.\n",
      "What’s promising about this new development is that scientists can pitch in and try to find out a way of neutralizing the dreaded virus.\n",
      "In the game, points are given to those who find solutions for modifying the genes of the virus. The more efficient or effective the solutions are, the higher the score.Developed in 2008, this game, Mashable SEA reported, helped researchers decode the AIDS virus.\n",
      "Now, if only the best players of the game could actually spend enough time to decode COVID-19, we might all be literally a mouse click away from a vaccine – and quite possibly the highest score ever in Foldit. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "The search for a vaccine for the coronavirus, now named Covid-19 by the World Health Organization,is underway worldwide. Four major groups of scientists and researchers are racing to develop a vaccine usingvarioustechnologies, backed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, set up in 2017in the wake of the ebola outbreak inin West Africa that killed 11,000 people.\n",
      "The German pharmaceutical company CureVac in Tubingen, Germany, and Moderna Therapeutics ofPennsylvania,United States, are working together on a vaccinebased on ”messenger DNA” that wouldissue instructions to the body to produce the proteins to fight the virus.\n",
      "Inovio, also ofPennsylvania, is working with Beijing scientists in research on the genetic coding of the virus to get the body’s cells to produce proteins similar to those on the surface of the virus. The immune system learns to recognize the proteins so it is ready to attack the virus when it enters the body.French scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris are modifying the measles vaccine to work against the coronavirus.\n",
      "Australianresearchers at the University of Queensland are using “molecular clamp” technology” invented bythe university’s scientists to rapidly develop new vaccinesbased on the virus DNA sequence. The Australian scientistshope their vaccine will be ready in six months.\n",
      "Even asresearch continues to develop a vaccine that will fight the virus, it seems there is yet no definite findingabout how thecoronavirus invades and infects a human victim. If this can be established, it will mean fewer victims for the vaccines to treat.\n",
      "The “current understanding” on how Covid-19 spreads is largely based on what is known about similar viruses. It is believedto spread between people in closecontactwith each other (about six feet) viarespiratory droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs, and these droplets land on the mouths or noses of people and inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible, according to the Centerfor DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDCP) that a person can be infectedby touching a surface that has the virus, then touching the face. “Butthis is not the main way the virus spreads,” the CDCP said.The biggest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China wasthe Diamond Princess cruise ship forced to dock offshore in Yokohama, Japan, for two weeks. The China Center for Disease Contol and Prevention saidthe virus can also be transmitted along a potential fecal-oral route– via hands, food, and water where the microbes enterthe mouth or eyes or are inhaled. Itthus recommended strengtheningsanitation and hygiene measures, including drinking boiled water, avoiding eating raw food, implementing separate meal systems, frequent hand washing, disinfecting toilets, and preventing water and food contamination from patients’ stool.\n",
      "The cases are beginning to go down in China but they are multiplying in Europe, in the Middle East, and in Asia. In time, there will be a vaccine that will stop the disease, just as other epidemics have been stopped before. In the meantime, we need more information about how Covid-19 actually spreads so thatmore preventive measures can be taken to supplement the search for a vaccine to cure infected persons.

      "The Pharmaceutical Association of the Philippines (PHAP), which represents the research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare sector in the country, vowed to immediately bring new vaccines and technologies to cure and detect coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) once these are available.\n",
      "“Once available, our goal is to immediately bring these life-saving innovations into the country in partnership with the government,” said PHAP President Dr. Beaver Tamesis.Tamesis stressed, “Now more than ever, there is need for strong public-private collaboration to contain health threats.”\n",
      "He added that the role of the pharmaceutical industry is crucial in efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19. Pharmaceutical companies enable the research and development of innovations and technologies for the detection of the COVID-19, and in the ongoing search for its potential prevention and treatment.\n",
      "Meantime, PHAP Executive Director Teodoro Padilla said\n",
      "PHAP fully supports efforts that will enable the pharmaceutical sector to continue the work it has started in the research and development of potential vaccines and treatments for the COVID-19.\n",
      "“We are also ready to support the government to contain this current health threat,” said Padilla.He echoed the call of Tamesis for stronger collaboration with the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country.\n",
      "According to Padilla, PHAP member companies are also looking very closely at their supply chains to ensure that essential medicines and vaccines are available for Filipino patients.\n",
      "“Our members have a continuity plan to ensure that the supply of needed diagnostics and medicines is uninterrupted during emergencies,” he said.Members of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) are developing new medicines and vaccines to help respond to the COVID-19 epidemic. R&D biopharmaceutical companies with potentially relevant knowhow have teams ofscientists checking their libraries for potential assets that could fight coronaviruses. PHAP is a member of the IFPMA, which represents the research-based pharmaceutical companies and associations across the globe.\n",
      "PHAP shares concerns that the COVID-19, for which an antiviral therapy is yet to be developed, is a serious public health threat.\n",
      "The speedy sharing of the pathogen sequence, followed by the declaration of the novel coronavirus as an international emergency, and the convening of a research and development forum, should further galvanize global collaboration with the private and public sectors for the timely development of vaccines and treatments, the IFPMA said.\n",
      "As a science-driven sector, global pharmaceutical companies have reviewed their drug and vaccine portfolios to see if there is any research that could be helpful in tackling COVID-19. This includes efforts to identify suitable assets in their libraries that could be utilized in the fight against coronaviruses.\n",
      "Relevant assets include diagnostics and biomarkers, approved therapies, or compounds in development that could be repurposed for use in treating patients with the coronavirus.Artificial Intelligence is also finding its place in the process, and is being used to mine through medical information to find drugs that might be helpful for tackling the novel coronavirus.Padilla noted that several biopharmaceutical companies are working with the Chinese government and research institutes in the United States and Australia to fast-track the development of vaccines against COVID-19. Biopharmaceutical companies like Johnson & Johnson announced that it has begun to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. GlaxoSmithKline, on the other hand, said that it is making its adjuvant technology available to support rapid development of candidate vaccines.\n",
      "In addition to R&D efforts, many research-based biopharmaceutical companies with a presence in China are donating funds, medicines, diagnostics and medical protective products.\n",
      "The IFPMA said that Johnson & Johnson has provided boxes containing laboratory-based investigations to the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention, which includes drug screening for anti-viral properties against the novel coronavirus. Pfizer, meanwhile, has made cash contributions to its global NGO partners that have shipped supplies to hospitals in China. Roche also donated diagnostic tests, medical supplies and financial support. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER\n",

      "“These measures have been clearly shown to be effective,” he noted.Abeyasinghe said that the recent advisory of the Department of Health that urges the public to avoid attending public gatherings for the time being was “an accepted measure.”\n",

      "Currently, Ghebreyesus said WHO experts are developing a master plan for coordinating clinical trials to ensure that they are done “coherently and consistently.”\n",
      "More than 300 health experts met in Geneva for a two-day forum aimed at addressing all the problems relating to COVID-19.The two-day forum was convened in line with the WHO R&D Blueprint – a strategy for developing drugs and vaccines before epidemics, and accelerating research and development while they are occurring.\n",
      "“Research is an integral part of the outbreak response,” said Ghebreyesus.\n",
      "“This outbreak is a test of solidarity — political, financial and scientific. We need to come together to fight a common enemy that does not respect borders, ensure that we have the resources necessary to bring this outbreak to an end and bring our best science to the forefront to find shared answers to shared problems,” he added.The meeting was hosted by the GloPID-R (the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness), a global alliance of international research funding organizations investing in preparedness and response to epidemics.\n",
      "Among the topics discussed were:\n",
      "• the natural history of the virus, its transmission and diagnosis;\n",
      "• animal and environmental research on the origin of the virus, including management measures at the human-animal interface;\n",
