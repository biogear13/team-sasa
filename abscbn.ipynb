So puwedeng gamitin iyan doon sa mga over 60 years old. Marami pang frontliners na over 60 years old,” ani Cabral sa panayam sa TeleRadyo.Gabi ng Huwebes nang dumating ang suplay ng AstraZeneca vaccines sa Pilipinas mula sa vaccine-sharing platform COVAX facility, matapos ilang beses na maantala ang pagdating nito dahil sa isyu ng indemnity o bayad-pinsala.Watch more in iWantTFC\n",

Maaari rin itong gamitin sa mga gumaling kontra COVID-19.Pero bawal itong gamitin sa mga may allergic reaction at mga may edad 18 pababa. May mga inaasahan ding side effects gaya ng kirot sa naturukang bahagi, pagkahapo, pananakit ng kalamnan, sakit sa ulo, at panginginig o chills.May iba pang malalang epekto tulad ng anemia, pamamaga, myelitis, at mataas na lagnat.READ: What to expect after getting a COVID-19 vaccine\n",

      "One of the recipients was a 28-year-old female Sumatran orangutan named Karen who had garnered headlines at the zoo when she became the first ape to undergo open-heart surgery in 1994.\n",
      "Each of the nine animals received two doses of an experimental vaccine originally designed for dogs and cats, with the apes exhibiting no adverse reactions, and are all doing well, zoo spokeswoman Darla Davis said in an email to Reuters.\n",

      "MANILA — More than 400,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccines arrived in the Philippines on Thursday evening, making it the 2nd COVID-19 vaccine brand to be distributed in the country. Here’s what you need to know about AstraZeneca’s vaccine:\n",
      "EFFICACY\n",
      "The COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S[recombinant]) or AZD1222 vaccine was developed by the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and the Oxford University.\n",
      "It has an efficacy rate of 63.09% against symptomatic COVID-19 infection, according to the World Health Organization, which included AstraZeneca in its emergency use listing.\n",
      "The Philippine Food and Drug Administration said it has an overall efficacy rate of 70% after the first dose and trials are ongoing to determine the efficacy rate after the 2nd dose.\n",
      "PH approves AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use\n",
      "The emergency use authorization document from the FDA states that it comes in two doses of 0.5 mL each, with the 2nd dose given between 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose.\n",
      "Despite concerns that AstraZeneca’s vaccine like others is less effective against new variants, the WHO said its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) still recommends its use.\n",
      "A WHO Philippines official said a study claiming that the AstraZeneca vaccine is only 10% effective against the South African variant has a very limited sample size and that it should not be a cause of concern for now since the country only has a few detected cases.\n",
      "The official also pointed out that while no vaccine is proven to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, the priority now is to reduce severe cases and deaths, something that AstraZeneca is said to be able to do.\n",
      "WHO says study on South African variant effect on AstraZeneca ‘very limited,’ deems COVID-19 vaccine still effective\n",
      "AGE & PRIORITIZATION\n",
      "Unlike Sinovac’s vaccine, AstraZeneca’s can be administered to the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions. However, it is not yet recommended to those below the age of 18.\n",
      "Because it can be used on the elderly, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said senior health care workers will be prioritized in the first batch of AstraZeneca’s vaccines.The WHO emphasized that the AstraZeneca vaccines coming from the COVAX Facility, a vaccine-sharing initiative that aims for equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, should first be given to health workers. Otherwise, there may be access concerns.\n",
      "“If we cannot demonstrate that we are following this prioritization, unfortunately, the COVAX may have to consider other options where the impact of the vaccine rollout will be more useful and practical and will contribute to saving more lives,” WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said on Thursday\n",
      "Health workers should be priority for COVAX COVID-19 vaccines to be sent to PH— WHO\n",
      "PLATFORM\n",
      "The AstraZeneca is a viral vector vaccine, which uses a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) in chimpanzees to carry thegenetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. Once injected into the body, it allows the production of the spike protein, triggering an immune response that will train the body to fight the disease if the person is infected later on.This is different from Sinovac’s inactivated virus vaccine, which contains the killed SARS-CoV-2 virus, or Pfizer’s vaccine using the relatively new messenger RNA technology.Unlike mRNA vaccines that require ultra cold freezers, AstraZeneca can be kept in regular refrigerator temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. The EUA states that the vials should not be frozen. This makes AstraZeneca easier to transport to other parts of the country and to administer.\n",
      "SUPPLY\n",
      "Besides the 487,200 doses that arrived on Thursday, the WHO said the Philippines “is receiving one of the largest consignment of COVAX vaccines.”\n",
      "From March to May, the Philippines is expected to receive 4.58 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccines.\n",
      "WHO: PH to be among biggest recipients of COVAX vaccines, 4.5M AstraZeneca doses coming\n",
      "This does not include the 17 million AstraZeneca doses secured through the government’s tripartite agreements with local government units and the private sector.\n",
      "Philippines books 17 million COVID-19 vaccine doses so far from UK's AstraZeneca\n",
      "There is still no schedule as of posting time on when the next batches of AstraZeneca vaccines will arrive.Besides the United Kingdom, AstraZeneca’s vaccine is being used under limited or emergency authorization in countries in Europe, Argentina, Brazil, India, Malaysia, Mexico, and others.\n",
      "Other COVID-19 vaccines allowed for emergency use in the Philippines are that of Pfizer and Sinovac\n",

      "“And so we need to have set up in the country the capacity to manage these large stocks of vaccines coming in, and also to ensure that the rollout is carried out, aligned to the prioritization that is expected from the COVAX to maximize the impact of the vaccine rollout,” he said.\n",
      "The WHO official said the Philippines has to demonstrate that it could efficiently roll out the vaccines while minimizing wastage.Abeyasinghe talked at length about the importance of prioritizing health workers, especially because of the huge sacrifice the sector has made for the rest of the population.Pfizer’s vaccines from COVAX was supposed to arrive first in the Philippines but was delayed because of a pending indemnification agreement, under which government would cover costs in case those inoculated experience adverse effects.The Philippines received 600,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac on Sunday. The vaccines have been rolled out to health workers all over the country.\n",

      "While vaccines from China's Sinovac have already been used to inoculate health workers, WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the 487,000 AstraZeneca vaccines arriving in the Philippines Thursday evening and those expected to be delivered soon should be earmarked for those most at risk, such as health workers.\n",
      "READ: WHO: PH to be among biggest recipients of COVAX vaccines, 4.5M AstraZeneca doses coming\n",
      "“We recognize that the last year has been challenging for everybody, but we need to acknowledge that possibly the largest sacrifice has been made by health care workers, not only by putting themselves at risk, but also their immediate families,” he said. “So it is our duty to provide protection to them.”\n",
      "He explained that having health workers protected would ensure the efficient treatment of patients.Abeyasinghe said the “prioritization is not something that WHO is planning to police” but he did add, “If we want to ensure that we continue to access the vaccines from the COVAX facility, we need to demonstrate that we can follow this prioritization, we can offer protection to the most vulnerable, most at risk in a prioritized way.”\n",
      "He emphasized the huge demand for vaccines in all countries and how everybody feels at risk, but that it’s “a matter of relative risk.”\n",
      "As of March 1, a total of 14,874 health workers have been infected with COVID-19 in the Philippines, among whom 82 died. There are, meanwhile, 121 active cases.\n",
      "Abeyasinghe refused to directly respond whether COVAX would stop sending vaccines to the Philippines if it does not prioritize health workers for vaccination.\n",
      "But he said, “If we cannot demonstrate that we are following this prioritization, unfortunately, the COVAX may have to consider other options where the impact of the vaccine rollout will be more useful and practical and will contribute to saving more lives.”\n",
      "He specifically pointed out that the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) already identified health workers as most at risk for COVID-19. He also urged everyone to “respect the prioritization” that will be determined by the Department of Health and the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) in consultation with them.DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they are meeting with NITAG on Thursday to discuss the allocation of the AstraZeneca vaccines.\n",
      "Access to COVID-19 vaccines has long been a problem for the Philippines, which has lagged behind its neighbors in Asia in starting the rollout of vaccines.\n",

      "“Ang sabi nga niya is that unless he sees about, he gave a figure like 2 million vaccines being rolled out as a start, then that’s when he will start reconsidering about itong pagbubukas, more openly ng ating GCQ, General Community Quarantine areas, to consider again putting it under modified GCQ, and doon sa limited face-to-face classes,” he said.Face-to-face classes, if allowed, will only be held in areas with low COVID-19 transmission rates, Nograles said in a televised press briefing.READ: Senate OKs resolution recommending resumption of face-to-face classes\n",

      "A package of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is shown in the state of Brandenburg where the first coronavirus vaccinations are given in doctors' surgeries, in Senftenberg, Germany, March 3, 2021. Hannibal Hanschke/Pool via Reuters\n",
      "When the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was first authorized by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, it was hailed as a milestone in turning the tide on the coronavirus.\n",
      "But in the time since, this highly efficacious vaccine has suffered a lot of reputational damage. In January, the German press and French president Emmanuel Macron falsely claimed that it is largely ineffective in people over 65, despite there being no evidence to support this.\n",
      "Philippines to get 487,000 AstraZeneca COVID-19 shots on Thursday\n",
      "Yet concrete evidence on how protective the vaccine is in older people has been lacking, leading some European countries to restrict the vaccine to under-65s. Together, these factors appear to have created high levels of skepticism in Europe and low levels of uptake.\n",
      "READ: FAST FACTS: What you need to know about the AstraZeneca vaccine\n",
      "Thankfully, though, more information on how well the vaccine works is arriving all of the time – and seeing the vaccine’s positive effects, some countries are now reversing their restrictions on giving it to over-65s. Here’s what we know so far about the vaccine’s effects.\n",
      "Trials suggested it’s a bit less protective than other vaccines. Pfizer’s, for example, prevented symptomatic disease 95 percent of the time in testing, whereas the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine did so 70 percent of the time.\n",
      "READ: WHO says study on South African variant effect on AstraZeneca ‘very limited,’ deems COVID-19 vaccine still effective\n",
      "But recent real-world data from the UK suggests that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine might actually be a bit better than Pfizer’s at preventing serious disease and hospitalization. However, these studies haven’t been set up to avoid outside biases affecting results.For example, the Pfizer vaccine was rolled out first, so might have been given disproportionately to more vulnerable people. Also, these studies are preprints, meaning they haven’t been checked by other scientists yet.\n",
      "So whether the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is more or less effective than others at preventing COVID-19 isn’t clear yet. The important thing to remember is that all the authorized vaccines are safe and offer very good levels of protection against COVID-19. If you’re offered any vaccine, you should take it.\n",
      "READ: Pfizer and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines 'highly effective' in elderly: UK study\n",
      "An early stage of testing – a combined phase 1 and 2 trial – strongly suggested that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine would offer protection to older people. It showed the vaccine generated just as strong an immune response in older participants as younger ones.\n",
      "However, as we don’t know to what extent different parts of the immune response act against the virus, this alone didn’t prove that the vaccine would be effective in this age group. And in the final phase of testing – phase 3 trials – which are designed to prove that a vaccine is protective, there weren’t enough people over 55 to give a reliable estimate of protection for this group.\n",
      "Exactly how protective the vaccine is in older people remains uncertain. But a recent preprint suggests it works very well. A single shot of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine appears to reduce the chances of people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 by 80 percent after the first dose.\n",
      "It depends on the variant. A preprint suggests that the vaccine may be as effective against B117, the variant that has arisen in the UK, as it was against the earlier forms of the coronavirus.\n",
      "But against the variant circulating in South Africa, B1351, a preprint suggests it may be much less effective at preventing mild to moderate disease than it was against previous forms of the virus. It’s believed this is because of a mutation called E484K, which changes the virus’s exterior so that existing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are less able to bind to it.\n",
      "Sarah Gilbert, lead researcher on the Oxford Vaccine Development Program, believes that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will still protect against severe disease when facing these variants. However, this has yet to be proven.\n",
      "Variants circulating in New York (B1526) and Brazil (P1) also have this E484K mutation. We don’t yet have data on how well the vaccine works against these variants, but it’s plausible that it may struggle against them too.\n",
      "In the meantime, the vaccine’s developers have confirmed that they can tweak it to handle these mutations. They estimate an updated booster could be ready by autumn.\n",
      "You might experience some, but they shouldn’t be severe or last long. Common side-effects include a sore patch where the needle went into your arm, a temperature, aching, tiredness and feeling sick. These aren’t necessarily bad, because they’re a sign that your immune system has noticed the vaccine and is responding to it.\n",
      "READ: What to expect after getting a COVID-19 vaccine\n",
      "In France and Germany, reports of healthcare workers experiencing flu-like symptoms after receiving the vaccine – at rates of 40 percent of people or higher – have worried people. However, these effects were also seen in the vaccine’s combined phase 1 and 2 clinical trial. Researchers found that taking paracetamol helped, and that these effects had largely subsided after seven days.\n",
      "The intervals between doses have been a bit controversial, since the 12-week gap that’s being left between them in the UK is different from the dosing schedule that was submitted for regulatory approval by the manufacturer.\n",
      "However, it looks like delaying the second dose to 12 weeks after the first is actually a good idea. The protection from the first injection seems to last, and if you have the second vaccine 12 weeks later, rather than four weeks as originally proposed, that seems to generate a stronger immune response.\n",

      "MANILA - The Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) said Thursday it is open to the plan of the COVID-19 National Task Force to look into a lawmaker’s recent vaccination against COVID-19 there.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez earlier said in a television interview that they plan to investigate the inoculation of government officials supposedly with the Chinese-donated vaccines, which are meant for health workers.Quezon Rep. Helen Tan had said that she was vaccinated on the second day of the hospital’s vaccine rollout as her son works as a surgeon at the VMMC, where personnel have allocations for their families under the government's legal vaccination program.\n",

      "But based on the government’s priority list, frontline healthcare workers, the elderly, and other frontline personnel should be vaccinated first, given limited supply of the COVID-19 jabs.VMMC Director Dr. Dominador Chiong Jr. said that Tan’s intention was given a different meaning when she accepted Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine.“Congresswoman Helen Tan, personal na opinyon ko lang ho ito (this is just my personal opinion), being the chairman of the (House Committee on) Health, even wanted to show to everyone that vaccination with the Sinovac would be most advantageous. With her position, she could have access to whatever vaccine she wants. Mukhang nababaligtad ‘yung intent eh (It looks like the intent became different),” said Chiong.

      "He added that given the number of personnel under the Department of National Defense (DND), its attached agencies and the VMMC, the DND decided there is room to allow the allocation of vaccine doses to a maximum of three dependents per employee.\n",
      "Sought for comment on reports that authorities want to investigate her vaccination, Tan said there is no need to investigate her vaccination.“I can’t see any reason for them to investigate. I am a medical doctor despite being a congresswoman. [A] part of my regular rounds every week is giving free consultation to sick people,” she said.Tan, in a separate statement earlier in the day, also said she did not receive any “special treatment” during the vaccination and that the COVID-19 vaccine was a “rightful allocation” to her given that her son works at the said hospital.The lawmaker also emphasized that her inoculation was legal.“In getting COVID-19 shot, it was my intention, more than anything else, to help boost vaccine confidence of the public in the face of widespread concerns of Filipinos on the COVID-19 vaccine's effects, efficacy, and safety,” the statement read.“As far as I know, I did not violate any existing laws, legal guidelines or regulations whatsoever when I took the jab,” she added.VACCINATION AT THE VMMC\n",
      "Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana previously said that with just more than 14,000 who registered to get Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine in his department, they would only need close to 30,000 of the 100,000 doses donated by China.The rest, he said, would be given to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\n",
      "The VMMC, meanwhile, aimed to complete first the rollout of its Sinovac vaccine allocation before requesting AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shots.\n",
      "“Ang magpapabakuna lang ng AstraZeneca ‘yung hindi na-cover ng Sinovac by virtue ng age nila. Iilan lang naman ‘yung personal choice,” he added.\n",
      "(Those who want to be vaccinated with AstraZeneca are only those people not covered with Sinovac by virtue of their age.

It was also able to vaccinate some 776 personnel on Tuesday and 1,117 on Wednesday.\n",

      "May 3 vials naman daw, na katumbas ng 3 doses, ang itinuturing na wastage.\n",
      "Kung madaragdagan umano ang gustong magpabakuna, pwedeng humingi ng dagdag na dose ng COVID-19 vaccine ang ospital.Kung hindi naman mauubos sa Biyernes ang doses ng bakuna na ibinigay sa ospital, sabi ni Famaran, magtatawag na sila sa substitution list.\n",

      "MANILA - The Philippine economic recovery post-COVID is expected to start off with a near 10 percent rebound in GDP growth this year, but there are few roadblocks to growth.According to credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings, there are still \"relatively broad COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines which itself can, and will also have and continue to, have a cooling impact on economic activity.\"\n",
      "PH economy seen growing up to 13 percent in Q2 due to 'low base effect'\n",
      "\"That is part of the story too though but perhaps not as large a component as the containment measures themselves,\" said Andrew Wood, Director for Sovereign ratings at S&P Global.\n",
      "Vincent Conti, Senior Economist for Asia-Pacific at S&P, said prolonged lockdowns and high inflation would also be a serious downside risk.“If restrictions are in place much longer than what we are currently seeing, that does put a big dampener on the growth prospects of the economy. The other risk that would compound this, would be currently the inflation that Andrew mentioned,\" Conti explained.\n",
      "\"They are supply side in the sense they are driven by food pretty much, pork and vegetables, and they are transitory. But they do weigh on the disposable income that is left for households to spend on other types of consumption at a time when things are already very difficult,\" he said.\n",
      "Wood noted the inflation in the Philippines is actually quite high compared to other countries.\n",
      "“There are inflationary concerns all around the world at the moment, and these are at time roiling financial markets, and if we look at this chart, we are seeing a bit of an interesting trend around the world where some indices are starting to pick up. But perhaps the most notable uptick here amongst these peers, is really that line for the Philippines,\" he said.\n",
      "S&P Global still expects the Philippine economy to do well this year.\"The good news is we see a strong recovery kicking off in 2021. In terms of how our forecasts are shaping up, we are looking at 9.6 percent growth this year. I think it is very clear that it's almost a mirror image of the contraction we had last year, of just over 9.5 percent,\" Wood said.\n",

      "“Nagpadagdag na kami. 1,200 una naming hiningi. Ang aming pakay pinakamaraming mabakunahang papayag so sa estimate baka umabot kami ng 2,000,” said PGH Director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi.\n",

      "In an interview on TeleRadyo on Wednesday, Legaspi said the DOH acted immediately and delivered the additional supply.\n",
      "Legaspi shared that they had a good experience with their vaccination program as many people showed up to be vaccinated.“Siguro nung nakita ng mga tao na ang mga doktor na nangunguna ay pawang naniniwala na importante itong pagbabakuna, kahit anong brand basta mabakunahan po,” he said.\n",

      "PGH has inoculated 611 employees so far, he said. He shared that they only expected around 50 people to turn up on the first day, but 128 came.“Kahapon, ang dumating 483. I think in the NCR (National Capital Region) kami na 'yung pinakamarami ngayon,” he said.\n",
      "(Yesterday, 483 people showed up. I think we have the biggest number now for the NCR.)\n",
      "He added that even nurses and doctors assigned at their COVID-19 area also joined the vaccination program despite earlier reservations.\n",
      "Earlier, some PGH workers had expressed concern over getting vaccinated with Sinovac shots as the Chinese vaccine is known to have a lower efficacy rating than other brands.\n",

      "(We were surprised that there were some of them who decided to get vaccinated because they believe that they should get whatever is available because 50 percent is better than nothing.)\n",
      "On Monday, Legaspi was among those inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine at the PGH.An initial batch of the vaccine from China arrived in the country on Sunday, and the doses were immediately rolled out to different hospitals in the country.\n",
      "Legaspi said he felt “nothing out of the ordinary” after getting the jab except for a little pain on the injection site.\n",
      "But he said they received reports from PGH workers who experienced symptoms like body pain and low grade fever after the vaccination, but no one required immediate medical attention.\n",
      "Legaspi said they expect the vaccination program for the first dose of the vaccine at their hospital to end by Thursday, but would extend it if more people continue to show up.They are also setting the schedule of the second dose of the vaccine by Holy Thursday or Good Friday.\n",

      "WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden on Tuesday called on U.S. states to prioritize COVID-19 vaccinations for teachers to ensure children could return to school quickly and safely, and said every educator should receive at least one shot by the end of March.\n",

      "With three vaccines now available, Biden said he was confident there would be enough vaccines available for each adult in the United States by the end of May.\n",
      "The Democratic president said he was upbeat about reaching his goal of delivering 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office, but urged Americans to remain vigilant in wearing masks and observing social distancing.\n",
      "\"Today's announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic,\" Biden said in a televised statement from the White House. \"But I have to be honest with you. This fight is far from over.\"\n",
      "Biden's drive to get educators vaccinated more quickly comes amid a political controversy that has pitted parents pushing for schools to reopen against the teachers unions that helped put him in the White House and say the risks are still too great.\n",
      "Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said Biden's announcement was \"great news for everyone who wants in-school learning.\"\n",
      "Biden, whose new education secretary took office on Tuesday, said increased production of the three vaccines would boost what he called a \"national imperative\" to reopen U.S. schools given growing mental health concerns and widening disparities caused by the challenges of remote learning.\n",
      "Biden said over 30 states had already taken steps to ensure educators were vaccinated and that he was using the full authority of the federal government to direct the remaining states to follow suit.\n",
      "\"My challenge is this: We want every educator, school staff member, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March,\" he said, noting that parents were exiting the labor market in \"astonishing numbers\" to help their children learn remotely.\n",
      "To meet that goal, Biden said the federal pharmacy program would prioritize the vaccination of pre-kindergarten through Grade 12 educators and staff, as well as childcare workers.\n",
      "He said he was still pushing to have most schools open by the end of his first 100 days in office, but added that it required passage of the $1.9 trillion rescue plan working its way through Congress. The plan includes some $130 billion for the nation's schools.\n",
      "\"Let's treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is, and that means getting essential workers (who) provide that service - educators, school staff, childcare workers .... vaccinated immediately,\" he said.\n",

      "Domingo has yet to respond if the submission included interim results for the vaccine’s Phase III clinical trials, which is crucial in determining the safety and efficacy of a vaccine for emergency use.\n",
      "Currently, only Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sinovac have approved EUAs in the Philippines. The first batch of COVID-19 vaccines received by the country this week was from Sinovac.\n",
      "Domingo could not give any further details on the Sinopharm submission, except that like in the case of Sinovac, they cannot guarantee a 21-day evaluation period.\n",
      "This is because Sinopharm and Sinovac, which is a private company from China, do not have emergency use authorizations from a so-called Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA). They are also not included in the World Health Organization’s emergency use listing unlike Pfizer and AstraZeneca.Having an EUA from an SRA, which is recognized by the WHO, can expedite a company’s application within 21 days, as what happened to Pfizer and AstraZeneca.\n",
      "Sinovac, on the other hand, took more than a month before it was approved, also because it was not able to immediately submit its Phase III clinical trial data.\n",
      "There have been conflicting reports on whether Sinopharm has submitted its EUA request to the Philippines.\n",
      "Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Monday morning said Sinopharm’s application was already submitted but Domingo said Monday afternoon that they have not received any. He also could not check their online submissions because the FDA main office was closed due to a local holiday.\n",

      "President Rodrigo Duterte delivers his speech after the ceremonial turnover of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines at the Bulwagang Kalayaan in Villamor Air Base, Pasay City on February 28, 2021. King Rodriguez, Presidential PhotoMANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte \"seems to be setting a low bar\" for the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic when he said that the country could expect to return to normalcy only in 2023, an economist said on Tuesday.Economist Calixto Chikiamco also said Duterte’s statement will also damage and delay the country's economic recovery.“It is kind of scary because it will put a chill on consumption, it will put a chill on lending, it will put a chill on investments. It is quite a pessimistic scenario, because that will mean you will have 2 more years where you have some kind of lockdown, and mobility restrictions, and this will of course take a toll on the economy, on government revenues, on the need for social protection,\" Chikiamco said.Consumer rights activist and former Trade Undersecretary Vic Dimagiba also said the forecast is dangerous, and urged the President to take back his statement.“Maniniwala s'ya dun kasi Pangulo sya eh. Yun ang kailangan nating bawiin, bawiin natin ang ganong klaseng statement, by offering professional and honest suggestions.\"\n",
      "(They will believe that because he's the President. That should be taken back, take back that kind of statement by offering professional and honest suggestions.)\n",
      "Last Sunday, Duterte said Filipinos may see some sense of normalcy by the \"first or second quarter of year '23.\"Duterte made the statement after the government received its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines donated by China.Carlito Galvez Jr, Chief Implementer of the National Task Force on COVID-19, also earlier said the country may return to normalcy by 2023.\n",
      "Chikiamco said Duterte's statement undermines the vaccine program of his own government, as there are opportunities for the government to take charge of the situation through vaccination.“It seems to me they are quite setting a low bar for their own performance in terms of vaccination. Frankly, I think by the end of the year, there should be enough supply worldwide because by the summer of this year the US is projecting they would already be normal, and achieve their targets, so there will probably be an excess supply by the end of the year, for a lot of other countries,\" he said.Chikiamco also pointed out that other vaccine manufacturers are ramping up production.\"So I think the best-case scenario is for us to be able to vaccinate our population by 2022.\"\n",
      "Dimagiba also said the public must demand a better and clearer vaccination plan.\n",
      "\"Dito po sa ASEAN, ang nababasa ko, mga kapitbahay nating bansa, baka by the end of the year back to their normal place na sila,\" Dimagiba said.(In ASEAN, I read that our neighboring countries, by the end of the year, they expect to be back to their normal place.)\n",

      "MANILA - The Philippine government on Monday launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive, boosting its battle against the outbreak that has infected more than half a million people.\n",
      "Medical workers, soldiers and police in the capital region, the country's epicenter of the crisis, were among the first to be administered with the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech.\n",
      "During the first day of the government's immunization program, health authorities recorded 13 cases of \"minor\" adverse effects, which include pain at the site of injection, nausea, and itching.\n",
      "Despite low public confidence in vaccines, health officials have repeatedly allayed concerns that adverse reactions could occur as part of the immune response.\n",
      "In its global manual on surveillance of adverse events following immunization, the World Health Organization classified the reaction into 5 categories - vaccine product-related reaction; vaccine quality defect-related reaction; immunization error-related reaction; immunization anxiety-related reaction and coincidental event.\n",
      "For vaccine reaction, the UN's health agency refers it as an individual’s response to the inherent properties of the vaccine, \"even when the vaccine has been prepared, handled and administered correctly.\"\n",
      "Some minor reactions of the vaccine include pain, swelling or redness at the site of injection; fever, malaise, muscle pain, headache or loss of appetite.\n",
      "For severe reactions, the WHO said it \"usually do not result in long-term problems\" and \"are rarely life-threatening.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, immunization error-related reaction refers to errors in vaccine preparation, handling, storage or administration. Among the errors identified by WHO are non-sterile injection, reconstitution error, injection at incorrect site and vaccine transported or stored incorrectly.\n",
      "WHO noted that during vaccinations, those inoculated may sometimes experience anxiety-related reactions due to fear of the injection. These are fainting, vomiting, hyperventilation and convulsions.\n",
      "On the other hand, coincidental events occur \"after a vaccination has been given but are not caused by the vaccine or its administration,\" the agency said.\n",
      "COMMON SIDE EFFECTS\n",
      "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also listed these common side effects after getting the COVID-19 shots: pain or swelling at the injection site; fever, chills, tiredness and headache.\n",
      "\"If you have pain or discomfort, talk to your doctor about taking over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, antihistamines, or acetaminophen, for any pain and discomfort you may experience after getting vaccinated,\" the agency said in an advisory.\n",
      "\"You can take these medications to relieve post-vaccination side effects if you have no other medical reasons that prevent you from taking these medications normally,\" it added.\n",
      "However, the US CDC does not recommend taking the medicines before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent side effects \"because it is not known how these medications may impact how well the vaccine works.\"\n",
      "Those who got the COVID-19 vaccine may also apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth to reduce pain and discomfort where they got the shot.\n",
      "The US CDC also advised drinking plenty of fluids and dressing lightly to reduce discomfort from fever.\n",
      "\"In most cases, discomfort from fever or pain is normal,\" it said. Only seek the help of authorities if the side effects are \"worrying\" or \"do not seem to be going away after a few days\".\n",

Health workers and military personnel are on top of the priority to get these jabs.\"To my fellow Filipinos, please set your fears aside. These vaccines are backed by science and deliberated on by our experts. Filipino experts,\" Duterte said in a welcome ceremony for the Sinovac jabs.\"I encourage you to get vaccinated at the soonest possible time, and be our partner in preventing the further spread of the disease,\" he added.Health workers at the Philippine General Hospital and several other medical facilities will be the first to get the Sinovac shots on Monday, said Carlito Galvez Jr, chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.Duterte, in his speech, thanked medical frontliners \"for your valuable and selfless contribution in the fight against COVID-19.\"\n",
      "\"We recognize the profound sacrifices you continue to make every single day, even at the cost of being away from your loved ones and risking your precious lives just to take care of the sick,\" said the President.\"As I have mentioned before, I assure you that the government will always be by your side, ready to help in any way we can.\"\n",

      "Chinese teams began looking at vaccines to fight Covid-19 variants “a long time ago”, according to a leading military medical scientist.\n",
      "“We are running extended targeted studies tracking [vaccine] safety via national databases. We are also tracking the vaccine’s efficacy rate against the latest mutations,” Chen Wei, a researcher at the Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, said in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV on Saturday.\n",
      "“We have been tracking and analysing a global database of Covid-19 patients with more than 400,000 samples through genetics and biologics. Our labs then cross-examine the responses of virus variants – such as the Brazilian, South African and British strains – to existing vaccines,” she said.\n",
      "Chen, who is also a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said “research began a long time ago for a new and stronger vaccine targeting mutations”.\n",
      "While it might not be necessary to have specialist vaccines for the different variants – much depends on how they respond to the Covid-19 vaccines already being rolled out – Chen said China wanted to be prepared for any eventuality.\n",
      "“The vaccines [targeting variants] may not be used, but we have to prepare them,” she said.\n",
      "The CCTV interview came just days after Chinese firm CanSino Biologics released an interim analysis of the results of its final-stage vaccine trials, which showed the product to have an efficacy rate of more than 65 per cent at preventing people getting Covid-19, and 90 per cent at protecting against severe symptoms.\n",
      "The single-dose vaccine, known as Ad5-nCOV, was developed by CanSino in collaboration with a team of researchers, led by Chen, from the Institute of Military Medicine.\n",
      "China has now approved four locally developed vaccines for general use, but has yet to give the green light to any foreign products.\n",
      "Other nations and companies are also working on vaccine products to combat mutations of the coronavirus.\n",
      "American firm Moderna said recently it had developed an updated version of its vaccine to fight the South African strain of the coronavirus and had sent it to the National Institutes of Health for evaluation.\n",
      "US company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech are also looking into booster formulas for their Covid-19 vaccine, but said their original product was effective against the new strains, a claim echoed by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.\n",
      "Earlier this month, a small study found a vaccine made by Chinese firm Sinopharm and a second developed by Chongqing Zhifei could trigger immunity against the South Africa variant of the coronavirus, but their effect appeared weaker.\n"
