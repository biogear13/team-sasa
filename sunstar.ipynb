      "TO INCREASE public confidence in the Sinovac vaccine donated by the Chinese government, retired general Melquiades Feliciano and Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr. will be the first to be injected during a ceremonial inoculation in Cebu on Thursday, March 4, 2021.Feliciano is chief implementer of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases Visayas, while Aquino is chief of the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) in Cebu City.\n",
      "Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, chief pathologist and spokesperson of the Department of Health (DOH) 7, said DOH 7 Director Dr. Jaime Bernadas will need to secure a doctor’s clearance since he is more than 59 years old.The agency had advised that the China-made vaccine would only be administered to individuals in the 18-59 year-old bracket.“I will have my vaccination after,” Loreche told SunStar Cebu in a text message on Tuesday, March 2.\n",
      "Loreche said a total of 768 health care workers from the VSMMC will be inoculated using CoronaVac, the first Covid-19 vaccine to arrive in the country.Cebu welcomed the arrival of 7,200 doses of CoronaVac intended for VSMMC health care workers Tuesday morning.A total of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine CoronaVac arrived in the country on Sunday, Feb. 28.\n",
      "Aquino said they are targeting to finish the vaccination of their health care workers in seven days.He believes this first batch of vaccine doses can cover the last or second dose required for complete vaccination.He, however, admitted that some of the medical frontliners in VSMMC were apprehensive when they found out that the vaccine came from China.\n",
      "The VSMMC has a total of 2,987 medical frontliners.“It is not really ‘back out.’ Some of them, initially, mura’g dili kompyansa (they don’t appear to have confidence in the vaccine),” Aquino said.Aquino said he is fine with whatever vaccine brand as long as people will be vaccinated.Loreche said excess doses will be distributed among medical frontliners in DOH-retained hospitals in Central Visayas.She also said they expect 7,000 more doses to arrive between March 4 to 8. These are still for medical frontliners in both private and government health facilities, she said.“We have to understand nga dili g’yod tanan mahatagan karon (not everyone can be vaccinated now). We have to prioritize those working in Covid areas,” she said.Joseph Stephen Descallar, Philippine Nurses Association (PNA) 7 governor, said what is important is that the vaccine is approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).“The brand is just a secondary criterion, but safety is our utmost concern,” he said.He said the earlier the vaccination, the earlier herd immunity will be achieved, which will give way to the reopening of the economy and the return to normal activities.“The vaccination is not compulsory, but we encouraged our members to be vaccinated as long as there is a right to choose and the right to information,” he said.PNA Cebu has around 2,000 members.In a separate interview with the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas, Dr. Junjie Zuasula, head of DOH 7’s Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit, said there is a need to “maximize” the supply of Covid-19 vaccines in the country.“Achieving herd immunity will take time. It will also depend on the supply of vaccines. But one thing is certain, we will achieve herd immunity in due time,” he said.Loreche appealed to the public to remain cautious even after they get vaccinated. She emphasized the need to observe minimum health measures, such as the wearing of face masks.“It doesn’t mean that if you get vaccinated, you no longer follow the minimum health protocols. This is our new normal already. Magpakabana gyud ta (We need to be careful),” she said.Earlier, Dr. Van Phillip Baton, DOH 7 medical program coordinator for infectious diseases, said the DOH 7 targets to vaccinate 5,634,789 individuals in the region this year.Meanwhile, Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella said he understands if some Cebuanos don’t want to be injected with the Sinovac vaccine.He said residents of Cebu City have the right to choose what brand of vaccine they want. That’s why the City Government is waiting for FDA approval before it can use the P400 million it has set aside to purchase the vaccine.“As I have said before, we will give them the opportunity to choose. They have the right to refuse and wait for another vaccine brand that the City will purchase,” he said in a mix of Cebuano and English.City Councilor Dave Tumulak, for his part, said he will be at the VSMMC on the first day of vaccination on March 4, adding that he will be among those who will be injected with the CoronaVac.Although the vaccines are intended for medical frontliners of the hospital, Tumulak said he saw the need to personally feel its effects so he can share the information with the public.In Mandaue City, the Vaccine Board has registered 1,616 medical workers out of the 2,000 priority target.These medical workers are from government-owned medical facilities, private clinics and private medical facilities, excluding private hospitals.Ernie Manatad, Vaccine Board chairman and president of the Association of Barangay Councils, said they will register local government unit frontliners and senior citizens next.Manatad clarified that individuals can refuse to be vaccinated but they cannot refuse to be registered.He said the Vaccine Board will start its information drive to make residents understand the importance of getting inoculated against Covid-19.

      "DAVAO City Mayor Sara Z. Duterte-Carpio announced on Monday, January 11, 2021, that the city government has already made progress in its procurement for Covid-19 vaccines.“Pirmado na tanang contracts nga gipangayo sa atoa sa AstraZeneca. Nahatagan na pud ta og authority gikan sa Sangguniang Panlungsod para mopirma. Gi-submit na nato tanan sa ilaha,\" Duterte-Carpio said on Monday, January 11, 2021.\n",
      "(All the necessary contracts that AstraZeneca asked from us have been signed and submitted to them. The Sangguniang Panlungsod has given us the authority to sign the documents.)But what are the details behind the vaccine of AstraZeneca? Here is #AllYouNeedToKnow about Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca\n",
      "The Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, also known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and AZD1222, is a viral vector Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom (UK).According to AstraZeneca, its vaccine \"uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the Sars-CoV-2 virus spike protein.\"\"After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the Sars-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body,\" the pharmaceutical company said.\n",
      "According to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, \"Viral vector-based vaccines differ from most conventional vaccines in that they don’t actually contain antigens, but rather use the body’s own cells to produce them.\"\"They do this by using a modified virus (the vector) to deliver genetic code for antigen, in the case of Covid-19 spike proteins found on the surface of the virus, into human cells. By infecting cells and instructing them to make large amounts of antigen, which then trigger an immune response, the vaccine mimics what happens during natural infection with certain pathogens - especially viruses,\" Gavi explained. The harmless virus delivering the genetic code is called an adenovirus.This is the same technology being used by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology for Sputnik V. This is also being used by China’s Cansino Biologics, Inc. for their Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen for their JNJ-78436735. All three and AstraZeneca are currently in Phase 3 of their vaccine development.\n",
      "Safety and efficacyBased on the interim analysis by Oxford University, which has been peer-reviewed and published in The Lancet on December 8, 2020, Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca \"has an acceptable safety profile and has been found to be efficacious against symptomatic Covid-19 in this interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials.\"Trials were conducted in Brazil, South Africa and the UK.\"The participants were from diverse racial and geographic groups who are healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions,\" AstraZeneca said.In a statement, AstraZeneca said the study showed that the vaccine efficacy of Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca was at 90 percent when given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart. This dosing regimen was given to 2,741 participants.In another dosing regimen, the vaccine showed 62 percent efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. This dosing regimen was given to 8,895 participants.\"The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 percent,\" AstraZeneca said.The efficacy of the vaccine was based on the trials of participants from the UK and Brazil.Meanwhile, safety data showed that Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca \"was well tolerated and that there were no serious safety events confirmed related to the vaccine.\" The safety study was based on trials participated by over 20,000 participants from Brazil, South Africa, and the UK.\"The participants were from diverse racial and geographic groups who are healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions,\" AstraZeneca said.According to the study published in The Lancet, the vaccine \"is tolerated and that the side-effects are less both in intensity and number in older adults, with lower doses, and after the second dose.\"However, researchers of the study also pointed out that \"careful monitoring of safety, including neurological events, continues in the trials.\"Researchers also said in the interim analysis of Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, they \"have not been able to assess duration of protection, since the first trials were initiated in April 2020, such that all disease episodes have accrued within 6 months of the first dose being administered.\"The vaccine can be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.AstraZeneca and PhilippinesAstraZeneca's vaccine has become a popular choice among local government units in the Philippines.As of January 15, 39 local government units have signed agreements with AstraZeneca, National Task Force Against Covid-19, and the Department of Health. Some 300 private companies have also signed a tripartite agreement with AstraZeneca and the government.Quezon City has the largest purchase order with 1.1 million doses of the Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. Makati City has the second largest order with 1 million doses.Other LGUs that have signed purchase deals are City of Manila (800,000 doses), Valenzuela City (640,000 doses), Iloilo City (600,000 doses), Caloocan City (600,000 doses), Zamboanga City (410,000 doses), Pasig City (400,000 doses), Baguio City (380,000 doses), Las Piñas City (300,000 doses), Ormoc City (270,000 doses), Parañaque City (200,000 doses), Ilocos Norte (120,000 doses), Oroquieta City (120,000 doses), Vigan City (100,000 to 120,000 doses), Navotas City (100,000 doses), Muntinlupa City (100,000 doses), Bacolod City (P300 million), Mandaluyong City (P200 million), San Juan City (P50 million), Taal City (40,000 doses),Davao City (no available data), Taguig City (no available data), and Pasay City (no available data).On January 15, Island Garden City of Samal Mayor Al David Uy said the city government will sign an agreement with AstraZeneca for the procurement of around 50,000 to 60,000 doses.General Santos City is also working on its agreement with the pharmaceutical company to secure vaccines. Mayor Ronnel Rivera said that based on the proposed deal with AstraZeneca, it may be getting around 330,000 doses.On January 14, 2020, AstraZeneca, the business community, and LGUs had a ceremonial signing for the procurement of 17 million doses, including the first vaccine deal of 2.6 million doses in November 2020, of the Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.\"We are delighted to conclude 17 million doses, which can reach millions of Filipinos through the close collaboration between AstraZeneca, the Philippine government, local government units, and private sector donors,” Lotis Ramin, AstraZeneca Philippines country director, said during the signing ceremony.At present, AstraZeneca's application for the emergency use authorization of the Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is now pending with the Food and Drug Administration.The Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is expected to arrive in the Philippines around the second half of 2020.Davao CityDuterte-Carpio, meanwhile, said AstraZeneca has informed the city government that their vaccine could arrive around the third quarter this year.AstraZeneca is the first vaccine manufacturer that the city government has entered a deal with for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines.Duterte-Carpio said they have informed AstraZeneca in October 2020 of their intent to procure Covid-19 vaccines.\"As early as October nagsulat na ta sa ilaha na dunay ta'y interest nga mupalit og bakuna sa ilaha. They were aware of that intent since October (They were aware of our intent to purchase vaccines from them since October last year after we reached out to them),\" the mayor said.However, compared to the other LGUs that are getting doses of vaccines from AstraZeneca, the mayor said the number of doses the city is getting from the company is not that many.\"Katong order nato with AstraZeneca, gamay ra kaayo to compared sa makit-an nimo sa orders sa ubang LGUs (Our orders from AstraZeneca, is quite small compared to the other LGUs that ordered from them),\" she said.Hence, the city will be multi-sourcing its Covid-19 vaccines to be able to vaccinate its target of some 1.2 million residents of Davao City.She said at present, no Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer could immediately meet the needed doses of vaccines. This is due to the high demand but limited supply of Covid-19 vaccines nationwide.Therefore, the need for the city to procure vaccine from other pharmaceutical companies. Last week, the mayor said they are in talks with another company.Multi-sourcing will also allow the city to lower the risk of having a large group of the population experiencing adverse side-effects from a vaccine.\"Tungod kay kining vaccine bag-o, wala ta kabalo unsa side effects niya... We were thinking, dili tanan apektado sa complications sa isa ka bakuna (The vaccines are new and we do not know much about its side effects yet. We were thinking that we do not want everyone experiencing complications from a single vaccine),\" she said.As to the budget, the mayor said there will be no limit to how much the city can spend for the vaccine, as long as it will meet its target number of individuals that need to be vaccinated.Global sceneTowards the end of 2020, AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine was approved for emergency supply in the United Kingdom.Argentina's National Administrator for Food and Medical Technology also approved the vaccine for emergency use around the end of December 2020. The South American nation will buy 22.4 million doses of the Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, according to reports by Reuters.It has also been granted emergency use in India, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, and Morocco for the active immunization of adults.\n"

      "THOUGH hesitant at first, the number of healthcare workers (HCWs) at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) in Cebu City who consented to be inoculated with Sinovac’s CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine has increased as of Wednesday, March 3, 2021.VSMMC chief Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr. said 1,246 HCWs of the hospital have already agreed to be vaccinated.\n",
      "Aquino, 56, was the first to get the Sinovac vaccine during a ceremony for the first vaccine rollout in the Visayas and Mindanao held inside the new Center for Behavioral Sciences building of the VSMMC at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 4.After Aquino, Dr. Juanito Tiu of St. Anthony Mother and Child Hospital, Dr. Pythagoras Zerna of Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital, Ret. Maj. Gen. Melquiades Feliciano of the Inter-Agency Task Force Central Visayas, and Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, Department of Health (DOH) 7 spokesperson and chief pathologist, also received Sinovac’s vaccine.Cebu City Vice Mayor Michael Rama, Mandaue City Mayor Jonas Cortes, Lapu-Lapu City Mayor Junard Chan and Chinese Consulate-General Jia Li were present to witness the inoculations.\n",
      "“There was just a little pain on the injection, just like the ordinary vaccination. Other than that, they kept on monitoring my vital signs and BP (blood pressure) and it was okay,” Aquino said during the post- vaccination briefing.Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo of the Field Implementation and Coordination Team administered the vaccine on Aquino.For her part, Loreche said now that they have “shown the way,” they expected fellow healthcare workers, frontliners and Cebuanos to see that the Sinovac vaccine is really safe.\n",
      "“We believe that we have to have the vaccine as it is now because this the best vaccine that we have at this moment,” Loreche said.Loreche dedicated her voluntary vaccination with the Sinovac vaccine to the medical frontliners who have lost their lives in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.“I would always remember our fallen colleagues as they fought Covid with us,” she said.\n",
      "Around 50 to 70 VSMMC healthcare workers were scheduled to be vaccinated along with the hospital’s officials on March 4.Thereafter, the DOH 7 targets about 500 healthcare workers a day for vaccination in the coming days.Aquino said the inoculation of nurses and doctors at the Philippine General Hospital in Manila helped boost the confidence of the HCWs in VSMMC to have themselves vaccinated with the same Sinovac vaccine.The VSMMC received 7,200 doses of CoronaVac on Tuesday, March 2, the first batch of vaccines to reach the Visayas.Aquino said these will be enough to cover the second or last dose of the vaccine for the complete vaccination of priority medical frontliners.On the first day of the vaccine rollout on Thursday, 15 vaccinators were deployed by the VSMMC.Aquino said based on the guidelines, HCWs have the option to wait for their preferred vaccine brand without losing their priority status.But he said he hoped more VSMMC HCWs would trust and agree to be given CoronaVac in the coming days.Aquino said if some VSMMC health workers decline vaccination, the unused Sinovac vaccines intended for them will be forwarded to other government hospitals in the region.“I told the rest of the team of the hospital, maybe in the next third or fourth day, they can send it to whoever is on the list for vaccination,” Aquino said in a mix of Tagalog and English.\n",
      "Order of priority\n",
      "Those prioritized in the vaccinations are medical workers in hospitals catering to Covid-19 cases, followed by health workers in other hospitals and government-owned community-based primary care facilities.Next in line are those working in private healthcare facilities and institutions.As of March 2, 20 local government units (LGUs) in Central Visayas including the tri-cities of Cebu, Lapu Lapu and Mandaue, have created their Vaccination Operations Center (VOC) following a directive issued by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).The VOCs are tasked to prepare the masterlist of priority eligible vaccinees, existing human resources and the LGU’s needed personnel in the vaccination program.DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III who was expected to join the first vaccinations in Cebu on Thursday was unable to attend the ceremony due to the arrival of 487,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the country Thursday night.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Central Visayas will have an allocation of the AstraZeneca vaccine; however, the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group will still have to deliberate on the exact number of doses to be allocated to the priority sectors.\n",
      "Postponed vaccinations\n",
      "DOH 7 medical program coordinator Van Phillip Baton in an earlier presentation of the region’s Covid-19 vaccination plan during the first Regional Development Council 7 full council meeting for 2021, said there will be qualified individuals whose vaccination will be deferred depending on the assessment of a medical doctor.He said those manifesting Covid-19 symptoms on the day of their vaccination will have to be rescheduled until they are fully recovered.The symptoms include fever, chills, headache, cough, colds, sore throat, fatigue, weakness, loss of smell or taste, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and difficulty in breathing.Meanwhile, those with a history of exposure to a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 case in the past two weeks will also have to be deferred until after completion of the mandatory quarantine period.Those previously treated for Covid-19 in the past 90 days will also be rescheduled after 90 days, as well as those who received convalescent plasma or antibodies.HCWs who are pregnant in their first trimester will be vaccinated only after the first trimester, while those who received any other vaccines in the last two weeks will be rescheduled after completion of the two-week interval.Those inoculated with the Covid vaccine will be assessed 25 to 35 minutes after the vaccination for possible adverse effects.Available vaccines\n",
      "Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella is willing to be vaccinated should the vaccine be made available to officials.“Kung ako la’y mosunod, magpabakuna ko oy (If I had a choice, I would want to be vaccinated),” Labella told reporters.Labella said he will also not mind if he will be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine, as this has been proven effective in other countries.The Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV) Assistant Secretary Jonji Gonzales said 8,400 doses of Sinovac will be delivered to Bohol while 1,200 doses will be sent to Negros Oriental on Friday, March 5.Gonzales said the doses will be delivered to the Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital in Tagbilaran City, Bohol and the Silliman University Medical Center Foundation Inc. in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.In the National Capital Region (NCR), at least 9,000 received the Sinovac vaccine from March 1 to 3, 2021, data from the National VOC showed.A total of 1,184 people were vaccinated at the Philippine General Hospital, 221 at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital, 148 at the Lung Center of the Philippines, 82 at the Quezon City General Hospital, 300 at the Pasay City Health office, 86 at the Ospital ng Muntinlupa and 185 at the National Children’s Hospital.A total of 264 healthcare workers were inoculated in three private hospitals: The Medical City (4), St. Luke’s Medical Center (SLMC) in Quezon City (80) and SLMC in Bonifacio Global City (180).At the Philippine National Police (PNP) General Hospital, 810 personnel were vaccinated as of Wednesday, according to PNP Deputy Chief for Administration Guillermo Eleazar.The government started implementation of the vaccination program following the arrival of China’s donation of 600,000 doses of CoronaVac, the Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by Sinovac Biotech.Of the number, 100,000 doses were donated by China to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

      "AS SCIENTISTS and pharmaceutical companies in rich countries around the world are racing for the development and application of vaccine against the killer coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a Filipino Dominican priest-microbiologist based in the United States has also decided to make a vaccine that will be affordable and accessible to other middle to low income countries, including the Philippines.“I thought about developing this vaccine when I realized that many of the available vaccines being manufactured today have already been promised to resource-rich countries,” said Father Nicanor Austriaco, chief researcher at Austriaco Laboratory.\n",
      "Austriaco, who is associate professor of biology and theology at Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, said his proposal is to create an oral Covid-19 vaccine using a probiotic yeast.“It is a crazy idea but it has to be tested in the small chance that it would work. I decided to do this for the well-being of the Filipino people,” Austriaco told Sunstar Philippines in an interview.He said his project, dubbed “Project Pag-asa (Hope),” is in its “early stages of development.”\n",
      "Austriaco, who is a dual citizen, maintained that the earliest stages of his project “is not expensive.”“It is still in its preclinical stage of development and it will have to be tested in animal models before we can even talk about human volunteers,” said the Dominican microbiologist.According to the priest-scientist, a yeast-based system would not need refrigeration nor injections nor healthcare workers.\n",
      "“For now, I have adequate funding to complete the necessary experiments to make the yeast vaccine delivery system and to do animal testing,” Austriaco said.“There is no need for me to approach any government agencies at this time because this is still a lab-based project. I would only have to seek government approval if the vaccine delivery system works in animals. We will not know this for many months,” he added.In a report from Catholic news site Licas.news, Austriaco said he and his colleagues will be doing the experiments in his laboratory in the United States.\n",
      "The animal testing will be done in a laboratory at the University of Sto. Tomas (UST) in Manila.“We will do it as quickly as possible without sacrificing the rigor and excellence that science demands,” said Austriaco, who is currently on sabbatical as a visiting professor of biological sciences at UST.Austriaco will be in the country until August 2021.The Philippines, which recorded its first Covid-19 case on January 30, 2020, already recorded a total of 449,400 Covid-19 infections, with 8,733 total deaths, as of Sunday, December 13.The Philippine government is eyeing to inoculate about 50 to 60 percent of the country's estimated 110 million population starting mid-2021 to achieve herd immunity from the coronavirus.Vaccine companies to be evaluated in the country include Sinovac, Gamaleya, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer-BioNTech, among others.Most of the vaccines from the said companies reportedly require ultra-cold storage facilities.Topnotch Dominican priest-microbiologistAustriaco finished his bachelor’s degree, summa cum laude, in bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, USA.He later obtained his doctorate in biology from the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a fellow of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.In 1997, a deeper conversion with the Lord led him to join the Order of Friars Preachers, popularly known as the Dominicans.He attended the Pontifical Faculty of the Immaculate Conception at the Dominican House of Studies in Washington, DC, where he earned his Master of Divinity and Licentiate in theology.He also earned his doctorate in sacred theology from the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.Father Austriaco worked as an investigator for the Rhode Island-IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence Program funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a scientific advisor at the National Catholic Bioethics Center, and an ethics consultant for St. Joseph Health Services of Rhode Island.“Father Austriaco has intellectual interests both in molecular and cellular genetics and in moral theology. His laboratory at Providence College is investigating the genetics of programmed cell death using yeasts as model organisms,” read Austriaco’s profile on Catholic.com.Father Austriaco’s NIH-funded research laboratory at Providence College is investigating the genetics of programmed cell death using the yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, as model organisms, according to the Office of the Chaplains and Religious Life at the Brown University in Providence.His areas of expertise include Biology of cancer, aging, and programmed cell death, health care ethics and bioethics in the Catholic tradition, philosophical and theological implications of modern evolutionary theory.Austriaco’s first book, Biomedicine and Beatitude: An Introduction to Catholic Bioethics, was recognized as a 2012 Choice outstanding academic title by the Association of College and Research Libraries.His research works have also been published in a number of scientific journals.

      "WITH the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) granting an emergency use authority to the Pfizer and BioNTech’s coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, the Cebu City Vaccine Advisory Board (VAB) will have to choose a vaccine that will best suit the needs of city residents.City Health officer-in-charge Jeffrey Ibones, VAB chairman, said the City has been in talks with various suppliers, but it cannot make a direct purchase until the national government releases procurement guidelines.\n",
      "Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez earlier told Mayor Edgardo Labella that the City could buy from Pfizer since it has a storage facility that has a cooling system capable of storing the latter’s vaccine at minus 70 degrees Centigrade.Labella, too, had said he would prefer a Pfizer vaccine with its efficacy rate of 95 percent.Although the board has started formulating guidelines, Ibones said members are also considering problems that may arise.\n",
      "He said they need to focus on transporting the vaccine to the city, the capability of individuals who will handle the vaccine and when the vaccines will actually be available in the country.Some Cebuano netizens have complained about the City’s apparent lack of action with regard to the purchase of vaccines, especially with news that around 30 local government units (LGUs) around the country have already signed advanced purchase agreements with manufacturers.Ibones said this does not mean that the City is not preparing to purchase a vaccine.\n",
      "“Even if we say the City already has a memorandum of agreement to purchase vaccines, it still won’t be able to get to the vaccines without guidelines from the national government,” he said in Cebuano.In his communication with Galvez, Labella said the instruction from the national government is to follow the tripartite agreement among the LGU, the national government and the supplier.As long as there are no concrete guidelines and a green light from the national government allowing LGUs to purchase vaccines, the City cannot move.\n",
      "In the meantime, he said the City will just focus on preparing logistics.Galvez had already promised Labella that the national government would prioritize the city in its vaccination program.Labella said the City will augment what the national government will provide by purchasing its own using the City’s money.The City Council already approved in December the amount of P400 million, which is included in the 2021 budget, for this purpose.The council will add P100 million more this year, as the City targets to vaccinate 70 percent of residents for free.Aside from Ibones, the VAB is also composed of infectious disease specialist Bryan Lim, a representative of the Philippine College of Physicians; and Junjie Zuasula, head of the Department of Health 7 Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit.Cebu City has 552 active Covid-19 cases, based on the data released by the agency on Friday, Jan. 15, 2021.The city has logged a total of 11,333 confirmed cases with 10,082 having recovered and 699 having died from the disease.It has been recording two-digit cases daily since Dec. 29, 2020.City Councilor Joel Garganera, deputy chief implementer of the city’s Emergency Operations Center, said the City is “in a better position to address this compared to where we were seven to six months ago,” referring to the current spike in numbers.“We have the logistics, infrastructure and experience to control this,” he said.Garganera said the mayor suspended some restrictions last December with the expectation that the public would practice self-discipline, but this was not the case.As a result, Garganera said law enforcers will be “uncompromising” in enforcing health protocols.For the past days, police personnel have been conducting Oplan Bulabog, inspecting different establishments to ensure these are compliant with health policies.

      "Makati City Mayor Abigail Binay, on the other hand, announced on Tuesday, January 12, that the City Government is procuring 1.0 million doses.They are among the more than 20 LGUs that have signed agreements with AstraZeneca, National Task Force Against Covid-19 and Department of Health as of Wednesday, January 13, 2021.Other LGUs that have signed advance purchase deals are:\n",

These are expected to arrive in the country in the second half of 2021.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said each LGU will pay for the vaccine and reimburse AstraZeneca for all costs associated with delivery, distribution, storage and destruction of the vaccines prior to delivery to the destination port.The LGUs are also mandated to develop and implement a local vaccination plan that is aligned with the national deployment and vaccination plan.Each local plan should follow the geographical and sectoral priority list in the national plan, Roque added.The vaccines being procured by the LGUs are on top of the 2.6 million doses that private corporations are donating to the government. Half of these will be administered to private sector executives and employees.Each dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine costs $5, the lowest price among the candidate vaccines in the market. It is administered in two doses.The AstraZeneca vaccine was developed in partnership with the University of Oxford.Based on interim analysis of clinical trials in the United Kingdom and Brazil, it has been found to be 90 percent effective against Covid-19 when given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart.It is only 62 percent effective when given as two full doses at least one month apart, resulting in an average efficacy of 70 percent from both dosing regimens.AstraZeneca has a pending application with the Food and Drug Administration for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow its use in the Philippines.Aside from AstraZeneca, Novavax through the Serum Institute of India and Sinovac Biotech Ltd. of China will also supply Covid-19 vaccines to the Philippines.The government has signed an agreement for the purchase of 30 million doses of Novavax vaccines, which are expected in July 2021.Sinovac will start shipping vaccines to the country in February, with an initial 50,000 doses, followed by 950,000 doses in March, and two million to three million doses monthly until December 2021.

      "CHURCHES, malls, schools, barangay gyms and health centers are being eyed as potential vaccination sites in Cebu City.Cebu City Administrator Floro Casas Jr., co-chair of the Vaccine Advisory Board (VAB), said the City Government was in talks with the owners and management of the proposed vaccination sites.\n",
      "He said they were looking at the size of each potential site to ensure that physical distancing would be observed during the implementation of the vaccination program against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).“This needs to be studied thoroughly,” Casas said in an interview Monday, Feb. 15, 2021.Under the government’s national deployment and vaccination program, an ideal vaccination site must have a waiting area, registration area, health education area, screening area, vaccination area and a post-vaccination monitoring area, where recipients of a vaccine are observed for 30 minutes to one hour.\n",
      "Casas also said the City Government has begun the process of establishing its vaccine operations center (VOC), as required by the National Vaccine Operations Center.Cebu City, which has been identified as a priority area for the rollout of vaccines because of rising cases of infection, was among the local government units (LGU) that were earlier directed to immediately activate a local VOC.\n",
      "VaccinesAside from the vaccines that will be provided by the national government, a portfolio of other vaccines are being eyed for Cebu City residents.Casas said negotiations with Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Sinovac were still ongoing.Given that candidate vaccines against Covid-19 are administered in two doses, except for the single-dose Janssen vaccine, Cebu City would need at least two million doses to inoculate its entire population of around one million.\n",
      "Casas said they need to know first the number of doses that will be provided by the national government so they can negotiate to procure the balance.Under the present procurement setup, LGUs may purchase vaccines only through the national government to ensure vaccine equity.Candidate vaccines against Covid-19 are still under development and are not approved for commercial use yet, although an emergency use authorization (EUA) may be issued to allow the use of a vaccine during a public health emergency.So far, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the Philippines has issued an EUA for the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-Oxford.\n",

      "The government is expecting 117,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine this month, through the Covax facility, a mechanism that ensures global vaccine equity.Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said Monday, that healthcare frontliners from 34 hospitals, including the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) in Cebu City, will receive the vaccine first.Aside from the VSMMC, other hospitals prioritized for the Pfizer vaccine are 32 facilities in Metro Manila and the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City.As of Monday, Vergeire said most of these 34 hospitals have submitted their verified lists of priority recipients as well as quick substitution lists.“Some hospitals are still completing their quick subsitution lists,” Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is administered in two doses 28 days apart to persons who are at least 16 years old but not more than 80 years old.The Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNitag) earlier said the following allocation framework will be followed in the distribution of the Pfizer vaccines: Covid-19 dedicated hospitals, Covid-19 referral hospitals, DOH-owned hospitals, LGU hospitals, hospitals for uniformed services/personnel and private hospitals.The frontline workers in the 34 hospitals belong to Priority Group A1, based on the priority population groups identified by the iNitag for vaccination.\n",
      "Covid-19 cases\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Cebu City Emergency Operations Center (EOC) recorded a positivity rate of 18.3 percent on Feb. 14, 2021, the highest since the city was placed under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ), said Councilor Joel Garganera, EOC deputy chief implementer.Infections have been accelerating in Cebu City and Cebu Province since January 2021, based on the DOH nationwide tracker.Cebu City continued to post the highest number of new cases nationwide, with 1,955 new cases based on onset of illness or date of specimen collection in the last 14 days, DOH said.On Feb. 14, there were 218 new cases, more than 200 for the second consecutive day. Active cases edged closer to 3,000, totaling 2,993 as of Feb. 14.Cebu Province, which came in third spot on Feb. 13, climbed to second place on Feb. 14, with 909 new cases over the same 14-day period.Cebu Province had 83 new cases on Feb. 14, more than 50 for 13 days in a row. Active cases breached 1,000 on Feb. 13 and increased further to 1,102 on Feb. 14.Quezon City followed Cebu Province closely with 908 new cases. Other cities with a high number of new cases for the same period were Davao City (764) and Manila (677).In terms of total cases, however, Cebu City and Cebu Province were not among the top five cities and provinces nationwide.Cebu City had 14,822 total cases, with 714 deaths and 11,115 recoveries aside from the 2,993 active cases, while Cebu Province had 8,871 cumulative cases, with 438 deaths, 7,331 recoveries and 1,102 active cases, as of Feb. 14.The five highest cumulative cases as of Feb. 14 were in Quezon City (42,815), Manila (28,673), Cavite (26,281), Laguna (24,668) and Rizal (21,985).

      "(This is the third part of a special report by SunStar Philippines on efforts to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic through vaccination.)NEARLY 24.7 million Filipinos, or about 23 percent of the population, will receive the free vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) first.\n",
      "Among them are the frontline health workers, senior citizens, indigent population and the uniformed personnel, Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje said.The priority list, or Group A, includes:\n",
      "1,762,994 frontline health workers in both public and private hospitals, and barangay health workers;\n",
      "3,789,874 indigent senior citizens;\n",
      "5,678,544 remaining senior citizens;\n",
      "12,911,193 indigent population; and\n",
      "525,523 uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Philippine National Police (PNP), Philippine Coast Guard, Bureau of Fire Protection and Cafgu.\n",
      "Next in line, or Group B, are the teachers; social workers; government workers; essential workers outside health, education, social welfare sectors including agriculture, food industry, transportation, tourism, manufacturing and construction, among others; special groups such as persons deprived of liberty, persons with disability and those living in high density areas; overseas Filipino workers and other remaining workforce.\n",
      "They comprise 10.15 percent of the Filipinos.After everyone on this priority list is inoculated, the rest of the Philippines’ 109.58 million population will receive the vaccine. This would be Group C.Cabotaje assured that all Filipinos will be vaccinated. For 2021, the target is to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos.\n",
      "“Lahat mababakunahan, may mauuna nga lamang (Everyone will be vaccinated, some people ahead of others),” she said in a virtual press conference on Tuesday, January 27, 2021.DOH, however, has stressed that vaccination is not mandatory. The vaccine will be administered only on those who sign a final consent form.The priority sectors and areas for the deployment of vaccines were identified in the three-year National Deployment and Vaccination Plan, which was approved by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Infectious Diseases on January 21.\n",
      "The plan was adopted for implementation by the National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19 on January 26, less than a month before the expected arrival of the first shipments of Covid-19 vaccines.DeploymentUnder the plan, the vaccines will be deployed by phases depending on the time of delivery, available doses and logistical requirements.Since the delivery of vaccines to the country would be in tranches, deployment would be based on the number of active cases of infection per region and the attack rate per 100,000 in the recent four weeks.As of January, the country’s 17 regions are prioritized as follows:\n",
      "National Capital Region\n",
      "Calabarzon (IV-A)\n",
      "Central Luzon (III)\n",
      "Central Visayas (VII)\n",

      "Bangsamoro Autonomous Region\n",
      "Mimaropa (IV-B)\n",
      "Caraga Administrative Region\n",
      "Cordillera Administrative Region\n",
      "This priority list will be reviewed monthly and recalibrated based on the active cases and attack rates.Local government units have been directed to draw up their own vaccination plans aligned with the national plan.As of January 31, the cities of Manila, Taguig, Pasig, Valenzuela, San Juan, Muntinlupa, Mandaluyong, Quezon and Iloilo, and the municipality of Carmona in Cavite have completed their local plans.Cold storageThree major cold storage hubs for the vaccines have been initially identified.The cold storage facility of United Laboratories Inc. (Unilab) in Biñan City in Laguna can store around five million doses of vaccine at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.Zuellig Pharma Corporation in Parañaque City, Metro Manila can store up to 6.5 million doses at ultra-low temperatures of -80 degrees Celsius. Its walk-in freezers, capable of temperatures ranging from -50 to -25 degrees Celsius, can hold 40 million doses. Its cold rooms, with temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, can store up to 629 million doses.The Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila has committed its storage facility with a temperature of as low as -80 degrees Celsius. It also has four cold rooms at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius and one -20 degrees Celsius walk-in freezer.Prior to the arrival of the vaccines, the LGUs should prepare the master list of the eligible vaccinees to determine the number of doses that should be delivered to an area.The deadline for the master list for Group A was on January 31. Patient profile and consent for the frontline health services under Group A should be completed by February 15.The master list for Groups A and B should be completed by March 31 while the master list for Group C should be done by June 30.Vaccination sitesVaccination sites should be identified a few weeks or days prior to the arrival of the vaccines.The plan recommends the following as vaccination sites: rooms in health facilities such as conference rooms, auditoriums, theaters and gymnasiums.If these are not available, tents or temporary buildings may be put up in parking lots and open spaces.A vaccination site must be spacious enough to allow physical distancing and must have several sanitation areas.It must have a waiting area, a vaccination area that can accommodate at least three vaccination teams and three AEFI (adverse event following immunization) composite teams, and a post-vaccination monitoring area.The LGU must also identify the vaccination processes and teams prior to the delivery of the vaccines.A vaccination team should have six members:\n",
      "2 physician/nurse/midwife for screening and assessment;\n",
      "1 health educator (volunteer teacher, social worker, medical student);\n",
      "1 vaccinator (physician/nurse/midwife); and\n",
      "2 documenters and vital signs taker (midwife/barangay health worker/ health staff or volunteer teacher, social worker, medical student).\n",
      "An AEFI composite team will have two members: a paramedic/nurse/midwife to monitor and provide response; and surveillance officer/nurse/midwife/pharmacist to conduct surveillance.There should be a vaccination team supervisor, preferably a physician, for every three vaccination teams as well as a supervisor for the implementing unit and a supervisor for the entire LGU.Other personnel needed in the implementing unit are cold chain and logistics officers, barangay captains, security personnel (police), drivers and safety officers (barangay tanods).In community or health facilities, the barangay health worker (BHW) and hospital staff will serve as social mobilizers while BHWs and local officials will oversee transport.Under the plan, the national government aims to engage other professionals to become part of the vaccination workforce.Vaccination processEligible vaccinees will be required to register, after which they will be provided with a vaccination date and time schedule, as well as an immunization card with a QR code that should be presented at the vaccination post.Walk-in persons will be told to follow the process since vaccines would be enough for those scheduled for the day.After a temperature check at the waiting area, each vaccinee shall be assigned to a specific vaccination team.The immunization card with QR code must be presented for scanning at the registration area and the vaccinee must present a government ID.He or she will then be directed to the health education area, where he or she will be given information on the vaccine. The vaccinee will then be asked to sign the Final Consent form.The vaccinee will undergo physical examination at the screening area before he or she can proceed to the vaccination area.After inoculation, the QR code will be scanned and the vaccination details (date of vaccination, vaccine manufacturer, batch number, lot number, name of vaccinator and signature) will be recorded on the immunization card.“Since karaniwan double dose ang vaccine sa immunization card, ilalagay kung ano ang vaccine na tinanggap ng isang vaccine dahil ‘yun din ang tatanggapin niyang second dose,” said Cabotaje.(The name of the vaccine must be indicated in the immunization card because the same vaccine must be used for the second dose.)She said there will be no allergy test prior to the vaccination.\"As a routine we have never been testing for (allergies). We just rely on the patient's health history based on investigation during the pre- registration and registration itself,\" said Cabotaje.MonitoringVaccinees will be monitored for 30 minutes to one hour after inoculation for any adverse reactions.Cabotaje said first aid will be given to patients experiencing adverse effects before they will be referred to a hospital, if further management is needed.The government will activate an incident command system, which will monitor all vaccination-related concerns.She said they were also looking at setting up a vaccination tracker to determine the number of people who have been vaccinated and monitor the volume of vaccines deployed.In general, Cabotaje said there will be no need for an RT-PCR test prior to vaccination.However, she said the DOH will issue specific guidelines on the vaccines based on information submitted by the manufacturers to the Food and Drug Administration.\"What is being recommended for Pfizer-BioNTech is, if you have a history of positive Covid based on RT-PCR, you defer the vaccination for 90 days, but this is still being studied if it is applicable with the Filipinos,\" she added.

      "Those who were included in the survey were police personnel from different provinces in Davao de Oro, Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, Davao del Sur, and Davao Occidental and in Davao City.Gultiano said some of those who refused to be injected with Covid-19 vaccine cited personal reasons such as religious belief, while others cited their fears of injection.\"Yung iba naman takot sa injection. You know what, even if police, takot sa injection, dili gani takot sa bala, pero takot sa injection,\" she said in jest during the AFP-PNP press conference.\n",

      "SINCE not all Dabawenyos are willing to get the Covid-19 vaccine, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio said the local government will set up an online registration site to \"forecast\" the number of vaccine doses the city will initially need.Duterte-Carpio said on Monday, January 11, that the online registration will be intended for those who are willing to get the Covid-19 vaccine.\n",
      "This is to shy away from the face-to-face registration, which might result in further Covid-19 transmission.The registration, she said, will serve as a \"forecast\" for the city to determine the number of people who would want to get the vaccine.The mayor recently said that the City Government will not be placing a budget limit on the procurement of the vaccine.\n",
      "But she also said that the City cannot place a budget allocation or targeted number of doses to be purchased because this would still depend on the number of vaccines the National Government will allot to the city.In addition, they also need to get the census of Dabawenyos who want to be vaccinated.\"Maong dili ta makatodo-todo because wala gyud tay official numbers sa pagkakaron kung kinsa gyud ang interesado na residente nato nga magpabakuna (This is the reason why we cannot progress further with our plans because we still do not have the number of residents who want to get the vaccine),\" Duterte-Carpio said.\n",
      "During her previous interview, the mayor said the City Government is targeting to immunize at least 1.2 million Dabawenyos out of the estimated 1.8 million population in order to achieve \"herd immunity.\"But she said it is unlikely that the city would even achieve its target number because there are some individuals who are not willing to get the Covid-19 vaccine.\"Possibly, kung mahitabo na, lesser na atong mga residents na magpabakuna, lesser than 1.2 million (It is possible that less than 1.2 million residents would be willing to be vaccinated),\" the mayor said.\n",
      "\"Maong importante sa atoa ang forecasting. Importante sa ato na mahibalo kung pila ang ihatag sa ato sa National Government [na vaccines] (This is the importance of forecasting. It is important that we know how many doses of vaccines will be given to us by the national government) so that we can also properly plan pila ang dapat paliton (how many doses of vaccine we should procure),\" the mayor added.She said the National Government cannot pledge or allocate the number of doses to be allocated to the city because they are also waiting for the actual delivery of the vaccines.Duterte-Carpio recently formally signed a contract with British-Swedish bio-pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Inc., which committed to delivering initial doses of its Covid-19 vaccines to the city by third quarter of 2021.But the mayor said the city will still be getting its Covid-19 vaccines from multiple sources since AstraZeneca cannot commit to delivering bulk supply to the city.She added that based on their received reports, some Dabawenyos are hesitant to get inoculated with the vaccine because of safety concerns.However, based on survey by the University of Mindanao-Institute of Popular Opinion (UM-IPO), conducted from December 7 to 19, 2020, only two out of 10 Dabawenyos expressed unwillingness to get the vaccine because of possible side effects, fear of complication, personal mistrust in vaccines, lack of empirical clinical studies affirming the safety of the vaccine, among others.Also, three out of 10 of the respondents expressed uncertainty whether to get the vaccine or not, \"with key reasons of uncertainty such as uncertainty of the efficacy of the vaccines, personal decision to observe the situation first, possible side effects to the body, general skepticism on vaccines and the like.\"Duterte-Carpio said the city will roll out an information drive to let the Dabawenyos understand how the Covid-19 works, and how it will affect them.But she said the Covid-19 vaccination in the city will not be mandatory.\n",

      "\"We will follow guidelines from the national government, indigent, senior citizen, and frontliners to be prioritized for the vaccine, if they want,\" Salda said.The local government appropriated P23 million for the Bayanihan 2 submitted and received by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) last December but as of January 5, the DBM has yet to respond.The matter was also endorsed to Benguet caretaker Representative Eric Go Yap.\n",
      "Salda said out of the P23 million, P8 million is for the purchase of the vaccine, P2.8 million for the purchase of the ambulance and P500,000 for the rent for the Concordia College, one of the identified isolation facilities located in the town, P5 million for the purchase of Personal Protective Equipment, and P5 million for food.Salda said for the supplemental budget of the town, Covid-19 vaccines will also be one of their priorities.\"Because of the affected budget for 2021, we did not appropriate for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccine. What we know is that it will be provided by the national government, now that some local government units have included in their budget. So for this year, if we will be having a supplemental budget that [Covid-19 vaccine] will be our priority,\" Salda added.\n",
      "Meanwhile, during the Laging Handa public briefing on January 6, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., National Task Force chief implementer, said the Philippines and Colombia will be the first two countries to take part in the World Health Organization's (WHO) solidarity vaccine trial and that 15,000 volunteers from the country, particularly from the Metro Manila, will be participating in the trial.Galvez added this is aimed to have a full evaluation for safety and efficacy of candidate vaccine, citing the government has a portfolio of vaccines from various manufacturers to ensure there is ample supply of vaccine part for the year 2021.He said they are in advance stages of negotiation with Novavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnsons, Sinovac and Gamaleya and they hope to close deal with the said companies this month.\n",
      "Aside from bilateral negotiations, Galvez said the Philippines stand to receive fully subsidized dozes for 20 percent (of the country's population) or equivalent to 22 million Filipinos through the Covax Facility, this is a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries worldwide with equitable access to safe and effective vaccines.\"Based on current negotiations, target number doses of 148 million for 2021 however it will be dependent on the global supply,\" Galvez said.As of December 4, 2020, 80 percent of the global supply has gone to rich countries.Under the roadmap for the implementation of the vaccination program against Covid-19, Galvez said they are targeting 50 million to 70 million Filipinos to be vaccinated for 2021.Prioritization will be given to sectors in the eligible group: health care workers, vulnerable, indigents senior citizens, poor communities, uniformed personnel, teachers, and school workers, government workers, essential workers vulnerable and co-morbid groups, OFWs and other remaining work force, students.The official said the vaccine will be a private and local government unit (LGU) partnership and not the sole responsibility of the national government, pointing out the whole government and whole nation approach to be adopted to ensure coordinated implementation of the Covid-19 immunization program.In the implementation, he added the LGUs will be in charge of identifying, profiling the priority sector, in their population, and support the vaccine programs rolled out. The private sector to provide technical and financial support.On Wednesday, January 6, Dr. Socorro Escalante of WHO said there has been a wide-scale and rapid development of vaccines, noting 232 candidate vaccines being developed, 172 of which are in the preclinical stage still being checked in the laboratory while 60 of the vaccines in the phase of the clinical trial.She said the Philippines is on track in terms of its preparation for the vaccines introduction and vaccine roll-out, including distribution of vaccines across the country.\"The first priority is the health workers because the rationale is to protect our health workers to sustain our public health system for Covid-19,\" Socorro added.\n"

      "THE Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the application of Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., making it the first company to conduct clinical trials for a coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine candidate in the Philippines.In a virtual press briefing on Tuesday, December 29, 2020, FDA Director General Enrique Domingo announced that Janssen’s application was approved Monday, December 28.\n",
      "He said he expected Janssen to begin the clinical trials right after the New Year holiday.Domingo said the Vaccine Experts Panel (VEP) will identify the venue of the clinical trials as part of the protocol.\"They will have a few preliminary preparations and they will start recruiting subjects for clinical trials, I suppose, in the next few weeks,\" said Domingo.\n",
      "Domingo said they were still assessing the applications of Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and Clover Pharmaceuticals.\"For Clover, we are still awaiting a few documents from the proponents so they can complete their requirements,\" he said.\"For Sinovac, they requested slight changes in their protocol design, research design so we had to give it back to the reviewers,\" added Domingo.Under the established clinical trial pathway, the application must be approved by the Vaccine Experts Panel, the Single Joint Research Ethics Board and the FDA.Meanwhile, Domingo said they expected to receive more applications for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) next month.At present, only Pfizer has filed an application.\n",
      "Domingo earlier said processing will take two to three weeks and Pfizer was expected to receive its EUA in January 2021.An EUA will allow Pfizer to distribute its Covid-19 vaccine in the Philippines for the duration of the public health emergency.Domingo said FDA evaluators will conduct preliminary evaluation within two weeks.This will be followed by the formal regulatory evaluation of the quality of the vaccine and clinical evaluation to determine its efficacy and safety.\"As far as I can see, all the requirements are already in,\" said Domingo.In early December, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order (EO) No. 121, which grants the FDA the authority to issue an EUA for Covid-19 drugs and vaccines that are still under development.

      "AN INFANT died a day after she was vaccinated at the Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital in Barangay Jagobiao, Mandaue City.Parents Crisela Toniacao and Johnnel Abello were still in shock and couldn’t believe what happened to their second child, who was one month and 25 days old.\n",
      "The couple told SunStar Cebu that Toniacao had a high fever when she gave birth to her baby through a cesarean section. The baby got sick and was given an antibiotic. Toniacao returned with the baby for a follow-up checkup and was told her baby’s fever had subsided and she was normal.READ: Probe into infant's death set as DOH tries to quell panic, doubtsWhen the infant was six weeks old, she caught the couple’s first child’s cough and was again brought to the doctor, who prescribed medicine for one week.\n",
      "The infant should have been immunized by then, but the doctor told Toniacao to wait until the infant’s cough was gone.When they returned the following week for a checkup, the doctor said the infant was normal and was ready to be immunized in a week’s time.Toniacao said the last time she administered cough medicine to her daughter was on Nov. 28, 2019. On Dec. 4, she had the infant vaccinated.\n",
      "According to Toniacao, they arrived at the hospital at 10 a.m. The attending nurse was allegedly busy with his phone and just weighed her baby and proceeded to inject one vaccine in each of the infant’s legs and administer an oral vaccine, she said.Toniacao said she was shocked when the nurse injected the vaccine without sterilizing her baby’s legs.She shared her suspicion with her partner that the nurse might have wrongly immunized their baby, who wouldn’t stop crying since the injection.\n",
      "“My daughter shook while she cried,” Abello said in Cebuano. He said their daughter’s left leg was kicking while the right leg trembled. The right leg was swollen and hot. Their daughter then developed a fever, he said.They tried to contact their pediatrician but the latter could not be reached.The couple decided to give the infant paracetamol at four-hour intervals starting at 6 p.m. At 2 a.m., they were awakened by the infant’s crying so Toniacao nursed her to put her to sleep.At past 6 a.m., they noticed that their daughter was not responding and had blood coming out of her nose.Toniacao said their daughter still had a pulse when they brought her to the Maayo Medical where the medical staff tried to revive her. They injected something in the infant three times to help her heart pump. The doctors also asked the couple’s permission to install a tube to support the infant’s breathing, which they gave. However, Toniacao said they noticed blood flowing into the tube from her daughter’s mouth.The doctors decided to send the child to the Seamen’s Hospital. When they got there, the doctors injected something into their daughter to get her pulse, to no avail.“The doctors did everything to try and revive your daughter, ma’am,” Toniacao quoted one of the medical staff in Cebuano.After their daughter was declared dead, Abello said they wanted her to undergo an autopsy to determine the cause of death. He asked doctors for help and even went to funeral homes, private hospitals and also to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) 7.Two doctors in a private hospital in Mandaue City were willing to conduct the examination, but they needed the guidance of a medico-legal officer. The couple requested one from the Mandaue City Health Office, but the person in charge was out of town.Abello said he found a doctor who would autopsy his daughter but the doctor, who was also in charge of the Philippine National Police Crime Lab, was in Leyte and would not arrive in Cebu until Dec. 7.While they waited for the doctor, Abello said the funeral home asked them if they wanted their daughter injected with formalin and placed in a coffin. He replied that they were waiting for the NBI to check their daughter’s body.After NBI 7 personnel visited their house and took a photo of their daughter, the funeral home contacted them again and advised them to place the infant in a coffin.The couple said they agreed to have their daughter injected with formalin after the doctor who would conduct the autopsy advised them to do so as long as no blood would be extracted.On Dec. 6, the couple was told the doctor would arrive on Dec. 9.The funeral home told them it had to extract their daughter’s blood so “it would not be rotten.” It fetched the infant’s body and extracted her blood.When informed of the procedure, the doctor told the couple he couldn’t guarantee the result of the autopsy would be accurate since the blood had been extracted.According to Abello, the funeral home also suggested writing down “convulsion” or “natural death” as cause of death and the couple agreed. The couple also signed a waiver.However, the parents continue to suspect the vaccine might have caused their daughter’s death. Abello told Sunstar Cebu that they were still willing to have their daughter undergo an autopsy to put their suspicions to rest.Meanwhile, Dennis Adlawan, administrative officer of Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital, denied the allegations.“Every time we do the immunization, we make sure that the baby is well, the vital signs are okay. Then that’s the time we give the immunization,” he said.He said there were other infants who were immunized on the same day as Abello and Toniacao’s daughter and they didn’t suffer their daughter’s fate.He said it was possible the vaccine had nothing to do with her death. The infant might have choked during feeding, especially if her head was not elevated, he said.The nurse in charge of the immunization, according to Adlawan, has been in practice for almost 20 years. He believes that what the nurse did was according to hospital standards.Adlawan said he couldn’t get a full statement from the nurse since the latter is out of town.Adlawan told SunStar Cebu they already reported the case to the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (Resu) and they are waiting for its feedback.He said their management is willing to coordinate with Resu and with the couple for the infant to be autopsied as they also want to know the real cause of death.Adlawan hopes this case will not discourage parents from having their children immunized since vaccines are important to human health, adding that the public should not make any judgments until the autopsy results come out.Toniacao and Abello’s daughter was buried at the Manila Memorial Park in Liloan, Cebu on Thursday, Dec. 12.\n"

      "RESIDENTS of Cebu City will be given priority by the national government when the Covid-19 vaccine becomes available next year.Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella made the announcement after speaking with Secretary Carlito Galvez, the chief implementer of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n",
      "“The most important thing he told me was that Cebu City will be a priority in the distribution of the vaccine. I had goosebumps and I was very happy that among the local governments, Secretary Galvez considers Cebu City as a priority,” Labella, speaking in Cebuano, told reporters on Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020.Labella said not all Cebuanos will be given the vaccine once it is rolled out next year.To address this, the City, if needed, will appropriate funds to buy the vaccines to help support the national government’s supply.\n",
      "The executive department has appropriated P500 million in the 2021 Annual Investment Plan to buy the vaccines.Labella said he didn’t include the appropriation in his proposed budget for 2021 as it was made prior to the discovery of the Covid-19 vaccines last month.He said that should there be a steady supply of vaccines available in the market, the City and the national government are willing to sign a tripartite agreement with the supplier for the purchase of the vaccines.\n",
      "Labella said that once IATF releases guidelines and the vaccines are available in the market, he will submit a supplemental budget to the City Council. (PAC / JKV)\n",

      "CERVICAL cancer is the second deadliest cancer among women next to breast cancer. In the official website of the Department of Health, it says that an estimated 7,277 new cases occur annually and about 3,807 of these end up in death.The primary cause of cervical cancer is the human papilloma virus (HPV) that is transmitted through sexual intercourse. However, there are also special cases wherein females who have yet to have sexual intercourse still had cervical cancer. One reason is that HPV can also be spread by skin to skin genital contact with or without sexual encounter. The HPV infection can affect both males and females. As HPV infection does not have early symptoms, it can develop into cervical cancer later in life.\n",
      "Only a few people know that even if cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women in the country, this is preventable through HPV vaccine. Below are five things you need to know about HPV Vaccine:1. HPV Vaccine can be given to girls as young as 9 years oldThe Department of Health (DOH) had been guaranteeing the safety and effectiveness of this vaccine and had since been giving it to elementary students for free. As women of all ages are advised to be vaccinated with HPV vaccine, it is the most effective among young children who have yet to have sexual activities. In Davao City, the City Health Office had been giving free HPV vaccine to elementary female students from 9-13 years of age.\n",
      "2. There are two types of HPV vaccine: Cervarix and GardasilCervarix are vaccines given to prevent cervical cancer HPV types 16 and 18. They are given for three doses at 0, 1, and 6th month. On the other hand, Gardasil had been noted to prevent genital warts, vaginal vulvar, and cervical cancer HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. They are also given in three doses at 0,2, and the 6th month. A patient can choose whether to avail of the Cervarix or the Gardasil vaccine as they also vary in prices per shot. As males can also have HPV infection, Gardasil is also given to males.3. Vaccines are readily available in your OB-Gyne's clinicWhether or not a woman already had her sexual encounter, the DOH encourages everyone to have their HPV vaccine already to decrease the risk of having cervical cancer later in their life. They are lucky if their local health offices offer free HPV vaccines. Otherwise, vaccines can also be taken from a trusted gynecologist's clinic or in authorized pharmacies. Price ranges from P2,000 to P4,000 per shot.4. Effect of HPV vaccines lasts a lifetimeEven if they may be a little pricey, the effect of the vaccine, once the three shots had been taken, is a lifetime. The DOH and other private health sectors continue to encourage women and young girls to be vaccinated and be safe from the future effects and risks of HPV infection and cervical cancer. They also encourage those who had taken their first shot to strictly follow and take their second and third shots as well.\n",
      "5. It had been used by DOH for decades nowFilipinos may have second thoughts about vaccines now after the issue with Dengvaxia. However, Dr. Julinda Acost of the City Health Office assured that they have been using HPV vaccine for their medical missions for decades now and they can attest of its safety. Last June 2018 their office used about 13,000 vials of Gerdasil vaccines for free vaccination to elementary students in the city.\n",

      "AS PHARMACEUTICAL companies make progress in the development of Covid-19 vaccines, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio said the City Government has been reaching out to vaccine-makers.Duterte-Carpio said in a radio interview on Monday, December 7, via 87.5 FM Davao City Disaster Radio that she already communicated with two different drugmakers and that the city has already drafted a vaccination program, which will be implemented once the city will have access to the vaccine.\n",
      "The mayor said she had a talk with a foreign drug company official, of whom she did not disclose, during the initial stages of the vaccine development. The official suggested to submit a formal letter to their company of their intent to have access to the vaccine.However, the company, later on, replied that \"they will only sell it to the Department of Health (DOH)\" for \"non-profit\" purposes, she said.Calling the initial transaction a \"dead end,\" the mayor said they scouted for another vaccine company.\n",
      "Reading the company's reply, the mayor said, \"Since there is still no eligible registered vaccine, all current inoculations are for emergency use. Large scale production and sale cannot be arranged at a present stage.\"Adding that the \"vaccine with credibility may be practically used for volunteers,\" Duterte-Carpio said the second company suggested that Davao City should apply for the Phase 3 clinical trial of the vaccination.In return, the mayor said they will write another letter to the company to include the city in their clinical trial.\n",
      "\"This will be voluntary sa mga initially identified beneficiaries for the vaccine. Kung muingon sila'g [vaccine company] 'yes' (This will be voluntary for those identified beneficiaries of the vaccine. If they say 'yes'), then we have to talk to the national government, and musulat nasab ko sa national government (and submit a letter to them) if they can allow the company to conduct the Phase 3 clinical trial sa (in the) city, and we will make the vaccine available for voluntary [purposes],\" Duterte-Carpio said.In their initial planning for the city's vaccination program, those who will be included are \"health and non-health frontliners.\"But she said that with the pandemic not ending for another two years, she said, \"we can come up with something for Davao City.\"\n",
      "While the National Government has not discussed allowing local government units (LGUs) to coordinate with vaccine manufacturers on their own, the mayor, in her personal opinion, said this might fast track the procurement process.\"Sa tanaw nako (In my opinion), if they allow LGUs to move on their own to look for access na (that is) approved by the national government, then we, the LGUs, may be able to help the national government move the vaccines [and] give them sa daghan nga tao (to a large number of people) in a short period of time,\" Duterte-Carpio said.She added that the limited number of produced vaccines is also a posed challenge for them to have immediate access to it.In terms of budget, the mayor said the local government has no problem in terms of allocating funds for the purchase of vaccines.She said the city can cancel or postpone city projects and activities, in order to utilize the budget for the Covid-19 vaccines.She also said that some businessmen already expressed their intent of donating Covid-19 vaccines to the City Government. But with still no approved vaccine, she said they are also struggling to have access.With the uncertainty of the vaccine's arrival in the country, Duterte-Carpio said the City Government will continue to implement Covid-19 restrictions, particularly on mass gatherings for the next two years.She added that not all will be vaccinated due to the limited supply.The mayor said the city will be regulating mass gatherings and special occasions, including weddings and baptism.\"There will still be a limitation in the mass gatherings because the pandemic will still be there next year. Tibuok 2021, naa gihapon ang pandemic. As I said kaniadto (The pandemic will still be there in 2021. As I previously said), everyone should manage their expectations na kung unsa naa sa ato diria karon, mao gihapon ang mga health protocols, guidelines, and regulations na i-implement nato for 2021 (We will still enforce the health protocols, guidelines, and regulations in 2021.) If not, until the end of 2022 ,\" Duterte-Carpio said.\n"

      "THE Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH 7) has started briefing its personnel and local government officials on the impending vaccination program against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) as part of measures to prepare the public for the rollout of the vaccines.It will be the task of the local government units (LGUs) to cascade information down to the barangay level, said DOH 7 Director Jaime Bernadas.\n",
      "Next week, he said, they will engage with the private medical practitioners to ensure that there will be no conflicting information on the vaccination program.“Let us all be united in this, including the private practitioners and specialists, to ensure that the government would not be saying one thing and the doctors would be saying another,” Bernadas said during the Cebu and Mandaue leg of the “Explain, Explain, Explain” campaign of the government on Covid-19 issues in Cebu City on Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2021.In coordination with the LGUs, Bernadas said they will be creating teams of doctors and other health workers who will implement the vaccination program.\n",
      "He also said they have designed vaccination posts, but these are subject to the response of the LGUs.He emphasized the need to prepare the people, educate them and raise their confidence in vaccines by disseminating information.He said this is a “critical time” comparable to that of the finish line of a marathon.\n",
      "Officials have pinned hopes of ending the Covid-19 pandemic on the candidate vaccines. However, studies are still ongoing on whether these vaccines will also prevent the new variants of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.Cebu CityIn Cebu City, City Administrator Floro Casas Jr. said the Vaccine Advisory Committee (VAC), of which he is a member, has held initial talks with AstraZeneca and Pfizer. They will also get in touch with other vaccine developers and manufacturers.\n",
      "He said they will procure a vaccine that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).As of Wednesday, Jan. 20, only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is allowed for emergency use in the Philippines. The applications of AstraZeneca, Gamaleya and Sinovac for an Emergency Use Authorization remain pending.Casas also said they were eyeing to tap medical technology and nursing students for the vaccination program.They have also started looking for suitable venues to ensure physical distancing during vaccination.Casas said they have yet to determine the cold storage facilities that would be needed since these would depend on the vaccine that will be procured.Most of the candidate vaccines against Covid-19 in the market require storage temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, but the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at an ultra-low temperature of -80 to -60 degrees Celsius.The Cebu City Government has allotted P400 million under its 2021 annual budget for the purchase of vaccines against Covid-19. This may be increased through a supplemental budget, Mayor Edgardo Labella earlier said.Vaccine shipmentsThe national government is expecting an initial delivery of 50,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine on Feb. 20. An undetermined volume of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine might also arrive in February, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said earlier this week.Malacañang said Galvez has secured at least 92 million doses of vaccines, as follows: 25 million from Sinovac; 17 million from AstraZeneca; 30 million from Novavax; and 20 million from Moderna.After its initial shipment in February, Sinovac is expected to deliver 950,000 doses in March, and two to three million a month until December.The government aims to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos.Bernadas said half, or 35.1 million Filipinos nationwide, are prioritized for vaccination in 2021. They include the senior citizens, indigents, frontliners and government employees.“The rest will be vaccinated in 2022. By 2023, all Filipinos should have been inoculated,” he added. The Philippines has a population of roughly 108 million.Covid-19 situationBernadas said the current Covid-19 situation in Central Visayas is more manageable compared to the May to July 2020 situation.However, the region is again seeing over 100 new cases of infection in a day in what officials have described as a post-holiday surge.“On Monday (Jan. 18), we had 109 new cases (in the region). It was the seventh or eighth day with over 100 new cases,” Bernadas said.On Tuesday, Jan. 19, DOH 7 reported 134 additional infections.Bernadas said Cebu Province, Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu City and Mandaue City are all showing an uptrend in new cases.Active cases stood at 1,954 on Tuesday while 23,230 have recovered and 1,453 had died.Negros Oriental had the highest active cases at 662, followed by Cebu City with 650, Cebu Province with 387, Mandaue City with 131, Lapu-Lapu City with 105, Bohol with 15 and Siquijor with four.Bernadas also noted that the number of Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms were increasing compared to those who have not developed any symptoms. He did not cite figures.Mild symptoms include fever, colds and cough. Patients who find it difficult to breathe require hospitalization. (WBS / PAC)\n",

      "PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte has approved the roadmap for the implementation of a vaccination program against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said the President approved the Philippine National Vaccine Roadmap presented by vaccine czar and National Task Force against Covid-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez on Thursday, November 5, 2020.\n",
      "He reiterated that, per the instruction of the President, priority will be given to the poor and indigent and frontliners (healthcare workers, soldiers, policemen, servicemen, essential services).“All Filipinos should have the vaccine, without exception,” he added.In a separate press conference, Galvez said a vaccine will most likely be available in the Philippines in a worst-case scenario by the end of 2021 or early 2022.\n",
      "But he was hopeful that the Philippines could access 10 to 15 million doses in the second quarter of 2021, particularly in May, June or July.He said that among the pharmaceutical companies that are in talks with the Philippines, Astra Zeneca has offered the lowest price at US$5 per dose. The Philippines has asked for access to three to five million doses, but Galvez said they were looking at seeking access to up to 10 million doses.The Vaccine Panel of Experts has also submitted to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases the names of five more vaccine candidates from the United States for consideration.\n",
      "Galvez said the vaccine roadmap is aimed at accelerating the deployment of the vaccines as soon as these are available.“Ibig sabihin po nito, mas mapapabilis na natin ang proseso ng pag-angkat ng bakuna, ngunit alam din po natin na hindi ito magiging madali kaya puspusan po ang ating ginagawang paghahanda kasama po ng ating DOH,” Galvez said.(This will allow us to expedite the importation of vaccines. But we know this is not going to be easy which is why we are making preparations together with the DOH.)\n",
      "Galvez said the most critical stage is the beginning phase, which involves scientific evaluation and selection of the vaccines. Lead agencies for this phase are the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and DOH.Stage 2 involves access and acquisition. This will be led by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Department of Finance (DOF).Stage 3 is the procurement process while stage 4 will focus on organized and safe production, shipment and storage of vaccines.Lead agency for these phases are the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) and the TaskGroup Resource Management and Logistics.Both agencies are tasked to ensure that the acquisition and development of a vaccine are cost-effective and time-efficient.The same agencies will be in charge of the distribution and deployment of the vaccines under the fifth stage.Implementation of the vaccination plan nationwide will comprise stage 6 and will be a collaboration among the DOH, national and local government agencies, and local government unitsStage 7 is the assessment, evaluation and monitoring of the program to be led by the DOH, DOST and the University of the Philippines National Institutes of Health (UP-NIH).In his regular press conference, Roque said the government is on track in the implementation of the vaccination plan.Aside from the crafting and approval of the roadmap, the government has also organized and activated the National Task Group on Covid-19 Vaccination and Vaccine Panel of Experts.Based on its timetable, the following should also be completed within November and December 2020: selection and procurement of vaccine; start of clinical trials; forging of bilateral and multilateral engagements and arrangements; and completion of an immunization logistics and services support plan.Within the first quarter of 2021, or January to March, the procurement process as well as production, shipment and storage of the vaccines should have been completed.The rollout plan for the vaccine nationwide should also be completed within the period.Foremost of the considerations in selecting the vaccine is its safety and efficacy, Roque said.Bilateral agreements are being eyed with China, Russia, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, India, Israel, Singapore, Germany and other Asean countries.Possible tripartite agreements are as follows: Philippines-UK-business sector; government-government-vaccine manufacturer; Philippines-vaccine company-business sector; Philippines-Indonesia-vaccine company; and Philippines-United States-vaccine company.Pooled procurement through the Asean as well as a multilateral agreement among the Philippines, Asian Development Bank, World Bank, World Health Organization and Unicef were also being looked at, Roque added.While waiting for the vaccine, Roque reiterated the need to comply with minimum health protocols such as wearing of face mask and face shield, frequent washing of hands and physical distancing.

      "CEBU will be one of the areas that will be prioritized for the acquisition of the coronavirus vaccine, according to Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health.He made the announcement while visiting fire survivors in Sitio Superior, Barangay Looc in Mandaue City on Thursday, Dec. 17, 2020.\n",
      "Cebu will include the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu and the whole Cebu Province.Go said President Rodrigo Duterte assured that the vaccine will be available to indigent Filipinos for free.He said the government will also prioritize frontliners and vulnerable sectors like senior citizens.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the senator said he will not change his stand against the in-person classroom setup until the public is immunized with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine.The Department of Education (DepEd) had announced that it would go ahead with limited face-to-face classes in January in areas with no or few Covid cases.However, Go said the final decision to allow face-to-face classes rests on the local government unit.He pointed out that a school will be locked down if a student or a teacher tests positive for the disease.The Mandaue City Government agreed with the Go’s stand, with Mayor Jonas Cortes saying it’s too early to hold face-to-face classes.His executive secretary John Eddu Ibañez said a physical classroom setting might put students at risk.\n",
      "He said the City Government supported the online educational system by procuring tablets for the use of local students.Go said he doesn’t want to stop the DepEd from pushing through with its plans, but he believes the lives of Filipinos are more important.“A life lost is a life lost forever,” he said.The Department of Health (DOH) on Sunday, Dec. 20, reported 1,754 new coronavirus infections, bringing the total case count closer to 460,000.These also brought the total number of new cases in the recent seven days from Dec. 14 to 20 to 10,389, around 8.6 percent higher than the 9,566 new cases reported in the previous week from Dec. 7 to 13.New infections averaged P1,454 a day on Dec. 14 to 20 compared to 1,366 a day on Dec. 7 to 13, the DOH case bulletins showed.For the fourth straight day, Quezon City registered the highest number of new cases followed by Rizal Province.Quezon City had a total of 526 new cases from Dec. 17 to 20 while Rizal had 375 new infections for the same period.On Sunday alone, Quezon City had 163 new cases, followed by Rizal with 104. Other areas with a high number of new cases on Sunday were Benguet (83), Laguna (83) and Bulacan (61).As of Sunday, the total coronavirus cases in the country increased to 459,789.The DOH case bulletin also listed 36 additional mortalities, raising the death toll from Covid-19 to 8,947. The case fatality rate remained at 1.95 percent.There were 8,080 mass recoveries on Sunday based on the DOH time-based recovery strategy, reducing the number of active cases to 21,708 or 4.7 percent of the total case count.Under this methodology, infected individuals with mild or no symptoms of Covid-19 are declared as recoveries if they don’t experience any symptoms in more than 14 consecutive days.The 8,080 recoveries on Sunday were lower by about 13 percent than the 9,269 recoveries on Dec.13.The DOH situation report as of Dec. 18 showed that the top three regions in terms of both active and new cases were the National Capital Region, Calabarzon and Central Luzon.Davao Region had the fourth highest number of active cases and sixth highest new cases. Central Visayas region was in the 10th spot in terms of both active and new cases.The Philippines remained in the 28th spot among countries with the highest number of cases based on the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center tracker.The tracker also showed that more than 76.3 million people have been infected worldwide and roughly 1.68 million had died from Covid-19 as of Dec. 20.

      "DESPITE the issues last year on the Covid-19 vaccine procurement of the Philippine government, it is now making some progress in the first of 2021.National Policy Against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said on January 6 that the government hopes to secure 148 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine this year. It is already in advanced stages of negotiations with six Covid-19 vaccine developers.\n",
      "He said the government is currently in talks with AstraZeneca, Novavax, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Sinovac, and Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology (Gamaleya Institute).To date, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the application of Clover Biopharmaceuticals and Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Johnson & Johnson) for the conduct of clinical trials for a coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine candidate in the Philippines.Gamaleya Institute, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca have applied for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n",
      "Galvez said the national government is hoping to vaccinate around 50 million to 70 million individuals this year. Healthcare workers and members of vulnerable sectors will be prioritized in the national vaccination program.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said on January 7 that Metro Manila, Region 4-A (Calabarzon), Cebu, and Davao will be prioritized for having high Covid-19 cases.President Rodrigo Duterte has also approved the tripartite agreement among the national government, LGUs, and vaccine manufacturers.\"As we negotiate with these vaccine makers and place our orders for the Philippines, the tripartite agreements with the LGUs will urge pharmaceutical companies to expand their allocation for our country. By factoring in the orders of local governments in our negotiations with these pharmaceutical companies, securing deals with them would be easier,\" Galvez said on January 7.Local government units (LGUs) have started to set aside funds for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines. Four LGUs are budgeting around a billion pesos for Covid-19 vaccines: Caloocan City (P1.125 billion), Makati City (P1 billion), Quezon City (P1 billion), and Taguig City (P1 billion).Davao City, meanwhile, is also making some progress in the procurement of Covid-19 vaccine. City Mayor Sara Z. Duterte-Carpio on January 8 said there is \"no limit\" for the city when it comes to spending for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccine.\n",
      "The city government also targets to at least inoculate 1.2 million residents out of its estimated population of 1.8 million. This is in order for the city to achieve \"herd immunity.\" To be able to achieve its goal, the city is eyeing to source Covid-19 vaccine from multiple sources.\"Assuming na tag two doses ni nga bakuna, walay makahatag og (Assuming that the approved vaccine will require two doses, no company can provide) 2.4 million doses. Walay makadeliver og ingon ana to a single city by any vaccine maker sa pagkakaron (No vaccine maker can commit to producing that number to a single city as of now),\" Duterte-Carpio said.At present, the city government has formally started its negotiations with AstraZeneca. The mayor said the city was able to secure AstraZeneca's commitment to supply vaccines to the city.The 19th City Council, on January 8, also approved an ordinance authorizing the city mayor to enter into and sign for and on behalf of the City Government the multilateral agreement between AstraZeneca, Philippine government, Department of Health, and city government for the procurement and acquisition of AZD1222 Vaccine.The recent progress in the acquisition of Covid-19 vaccine in the country gives us a glimmer of hope this 2021. While it may still be far, at least, there is an assurance that the pandemic will somehow end soon and we can return to what we have considered normal.\n"

      "CEBU Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia said she will prioritize the immediate needs of her constituents, instead of making a move to allocate funds for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines.Several local government units (LGU) in the country have set aside funds, while others have secured contracts with the vaccine manufacturers.\n",
      "“For me, it’s premature. It’s not a race,” Garcia told reporters on Thursday, Jan. 14.The governor further said even if the Capitol would set aside a budget for the vaccine purchase, it would not get the supplies right away because the purchase still has to undergo several processes set by the National Government.“If I tell you I will allocate P1 billion for the purchase of the vaccine, that will just make good headlines. But how to proceed with it? I will be subjected to existing national government guidelines, and just this point: the National Government has appropriated so much and targeted 70 percent of the population,” Garcia said.\n",
      "The Philippine Government has signed an agreement with Chinese firm Sinovac for 25 million doses of the latter’s vaccine CoronaVac.Recent reports stated that a group of Brazilian scientists reported CoronaVac’s efficacy to be just over 50 percent, way lower than the 78 percent level of efficacy announced last week.The National Government also signed agreements for 30 million doses of the American firm Novavax’s vaccine and 15 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through tripartite deals with LGUs and private firms.\n",
      "But Garcia will focus first on improving the Capitol’s services in towns amid the pandemic.“At this point, I’d rather focus our funds on what our people really need right now to help them pick up the pieces of their lives and livelihood, to improve our infrastructure,” she said.The governor said the Provincial Government will again distribute vitamins to the barangay workers and frontliners to strengthen their immunity.\n",
      "Independent cities’ moveThe independent cities of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu have moved for the vaccination of a targeted portion of their population.The Mandaue City Government has reserved P200 million to complement the vaccines that will be allocated to the city by the national government.Mandaue City Mayor Jonas Cortes’ executive secretary John Eddu Ibañez said the funds will be taken from other sources.Ibañez said if the vaccines provided by the National Government won’t be enough, the City Government will use the P200 million reserve funds to purchase additional doses.Mandaue City, according to the 2015 census, has a population of 362,654. However, Ibañez said the city has around 450,000 residents, and he said 20 percent of the population will be prioritized in the vaccination program.The Mandaue City Hall has a medicine storage facility, and it could be used to store the Covid-19 vaccine, according to Ibañez.The vaccine for the city, he said, may arrive in the second or third quarter of this year.The Lapu-Lapu City Government, on the other hand, is considering the Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Sinopharm and two other firms for its vaccination program.City Mayor Junard “Ahong” Chan said there is no reason to rush the vaccine purchase, saying the City has to choose the affordable and effective one.City Epidemiological Surveillance Officer Grace Mary Carungay said 60 to 70 percent of the city population will be vaccinated. The 2015 census states the city has 408,112 residents.Chan has tasked the City Health Office to prepare a vaccination plan.The cities of Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue will prioritize people 60 years old and above and frontliners. Mandaue City’s other priorities in the vaccination program are the children and teachers, while Lapu-Lapu City will include indigents, public utility vehicle drivers and vendors.Expert’s reminderAs the supply of Covid-19 vaccines has yet to arrive in the Philippines, infectious disease specialist Dr. Bryan Albert Lim said it is important for LGUs to focus on the preparations for the transportation of the vaccine, census on who will administer the vaccination, and a plan on how to monitor the vaccinated persons for adverse effects.The country has had no prior experience of mass vaccination in a pandemic, he told the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas in an online discussion last Jan. 13.The physician also appealed to the public to refrain from spreading misconceptions about the vaccine and its procurement. / ANV, NDT / KAL, KFD, WBS\n",

      "THE City Government of Davao is expected to receive an allocation of Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 by February, a health official said.\"By late February, we're going to acquire [it] from the National Government. Pero (but) this will not be a local purchase. This will be allocated from the National Government,\" Davao City Covid-19 focal person Dr. Ashley Lopez said in a radio interview on 87.5 FM Davao City Disaster Radio.\n",
      "Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 is the first Covid-19 vaccine to be issued with an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Lopez said this will be the first Covid-19 vaccine that will be rolled out in the city. He declined to give further details on the number of doses the city will receive.But the health official said medical health workers, who are on the government's priority list, will be the first batch to be vaccinated.\n",
      "\"Most likely, kaning (this) Pfizer [vaccine] na muabot (that will arrive) by February [will be] intended for our government health workers, hilabi na nga nagtrabaho sa (especially those working at) SPMC (Southern Philippines Medical Center),\" he said.But he said those working at the private hospitals will also be included.He said health workers in SPMC will be prioritized, considering the hospital is at the center of the city's Covid-19 response, which also caters to the majority of Covid-19 patients in the city and Davao Region.In a previous SunStar Philippines report, FDA Director General Enrique Domingo said in a virtual forum that the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would remain in effect in the Philippines for the duration of the public health emergency. In this case, he said the EUA is good until the end of the year.Pfizer-BioNTech applied for a EUA in the Philippines on December 23, 2020. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada, Switzerland, and Singapore have already issued a EUA for this vaccine.The Pfizer vaccine is the only candidate vaccine against Covid-19 that has been issued an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",
      "It is primarily aimed at preventing Covid-19 in individuals who are 16 years old and older. Prior to dilution, it has to be stored at -80 to -60 degrees Celsius.Health officials earlier said the government would prioritize distributing Covid-19 vaccines to priority groups including frontline health workers in high-risk areas such as Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Cebu City, and Davao City.The Davao City Government, in a previous report, has signed an agreement with British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines. The pharmaceutical firm committed to delivering initial doses of its Covid-19 vaccines to the city by the third quarter of 2021.Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio also said they are in talks with other Covid-19 manufacturers for additional vaccines.The city is targeting to immunize an estimated 1.2 million Dabawenyos for it to achieve herd immunity.\n"

      "EIGHTEEN areas have been identified as sites for the conduct of independent phase 3 clinical trials for three candidate vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), an official of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) said.The vaccines were developed by Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Clover Biopharmaceuticals and Sinovac Biotech.\n",
      "Janssen, which developed candidate vaccine JNJ-78436735, will conduct trials in Makati City, San Pablo and Cabuyao in Laguna, Iloilo City and Bacolod City.Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Australian subsidiary of Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals of China, will hold clinical trials for its S-Trimer vaccine, or SCB-2019, in the cities of Quezon, Makati, Manila, Taguig, Las Piñas and Muntinlupa, as well as in Calamba, Laguna and Dasmariñas, Cavite.Sinovac will conduct clinical trials for CoronaVac in the cities of Quezon, Marikina and Pasay, as well as in Alaminos, Laguna.\n",
      "DOST Undersecretary for Research and Development Rowena Guevarra said the three companies are expected to begin their clinical trials “soon.”Guevarra also said they were awaiting the guidance of the World Health Organization (WHO) on the conduct of the solidarity trial.Cristina Torres of the Forum of Ethical Review Committees in Asia and Pacific said the identification of the areas where trials will be held depends on the number of Covid-19 cases and the data provided by the Epidemiology Bureau.She said an independent clinical trial is hospital-based while the solidarity trial will be community-based.Beverly Ho of the Department of Health, Health Promotion Bureau said barangays cannot be forced to participate in a clinical trial but they are being encouraged.A crucial step\n",
      "Jaime Montoya, executive director of the DOST-Philippine Council for Health and Research and Development, said clinical trials provide basis and scientific evidence that a vaccine or a drug is safe for humans and is effective against a certain disease.Without a clinical trial, he said the FDA will not approve the use of a medicine or vaccine in the country.“It is a crucial step before any product for our use is approved by the FDA,” he said.Clinical trials have three phases after the pre-clinical stage of development, during which vaccines or medicines are administered on animals.In the first phase of clinical trials, vaccines or drugs are tried on 10 to 100 people to assess its safety. The second phase involves over 100 but less than 1,000 participants. A larger group is needed for the third phase.Participants should be “completely voluntary.” They will first be screened and will be briefed about the trial and the vaccines and will undergo physical examination and review of health history.They will be divided into two groups. One group will receive the vaccine while the other will receive the placebo, or fake vaccine.Torres said the three companies are looking for healthy adult volunteers who are 18 years and above, including senior citizens.Pregnant women are not allowed to participate in the trials.Participants should be aware of the necessary protocols of the trial and should be advised to keep a diary card where they will jot down the symptoms and other health observations following the vaccination.They would be given schedules for follow-up check-up and they will be monitored for a maximum of 18 months.Montoya said the conduct of the independent clinical trials should still adhere to the protocols of the FDA which includes insurance to the participants for any eventualities.He said despite undergoing trial vaccination, participants should still follow health protocols to avoid contracting the virus.

      "THE Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases and the National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19 conducted on Tuesday, February 9, 2021, a simulation of the arrival and transport of coronavirus disease 2019 (Coivid-19) vaccines.The exercise involved the government agencies and private organizations that shall be responsible for the logistics management of the vaccines upon arrival in the country.\n",
      "It included customs clearance through the one-stop shop; loading from the airport; transport of vaccines to the cold chain storage facility; unloading, receiving and inspection of vaccines; storing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM); preparation of vaccines for distribution; loading and delivery to various points of destination such as hospitals and health facilities; and unloading and acceptance of Covid-19 vaccines at the destinations.The government expects delivery of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine within February.Given in two doses 28 days apart, these would be good for 58,500 individuals.\n",
      "Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III said the healthcare workers from the Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Jose Rodriguez Memorial Hospital, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City will be the first to receive the vaccine.Any doses left after all the medical frontliners from these government hospitals are inoculated would be administered to priority personnel of the Philippine National Police and Armed Forces of the Philippines, Duque said.Upon arrival at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), the vaccines will be transported onboard a refrigerated van to the RITM cold chain facility in Muntinlupa City. The van will be escorted by the police.\n",

(BOC will conduct pre-clearance documentation so that when the shipment arrives, they will only inspect the box.)\n",
      "The vaccines will undergo inspection at the RITM two to three days before these are distributed to the end user.Galvez said there is no room for errors in the handling because the vaccines are “very delicate.”“The more na matagal ang vaccine outside of the warehouse, malaki ang possibility na magkaroon tayo ng spoilage... Mas maganda na mas mapaliit pa natin ‘yung time,” said Galvez. (Third Anne Peralta-Malonzo / SunStar Philippines)\n"

      "A KNOWN US-based Filipino Dominican priest and microbiologist has joined the global call for people, like those in the Philippines, to avail themselves of the vaccination program against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) amid reports that many are unwilling to be inoculated after being influenced by unscientific claims and broader conspiracy theories.\"To be clear, as soon as a Covid-19 becomes available for which I am eligible, whether in the USA or here in the Philippines, I intend to be vaccinated with it,\" said Fr. Nicanor Austriaco, chief researcher at Austriaco Laboratory and professor of biology and theology at Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island, USA.\n",
      "\"Also, as soon as a vaccine becomes available for my mother here in the Philippines, I will encourage her to be vaccinated with it,\" he added.Austriaco, who is also developing his own affordable and accessible yeast-based vaccine, said he decided to come forward after receiving numerous queries on his views about the vaccines.As the Philippine government announced that it will roll out its vaccination program in the first quarter of 2021, public trust and confidence in vaccines have apparently waned, according to a report from Asia Catholic news site Licas.news.\n",
      "Latest survey from Octa Research Group revealed that only 25 percent of the respondents would be willing to be vaccinated, while 28 percent would choose not to be vaccinated once the vaccines are available in the country.Another survey from Pulse Asia showed that only 32 percent were willing to be inoculated, while 47 percent would not receive the vaccine and 21 percent were undecided.Vaccine advocacyWhile Austriaco admitted that he has \"been very busy\" with Covid-19 pandemic management in the Philippines, he said \"it is time\" for him to encourage the public to receive the vaccines, this also as vaccination campaigns build up around the globe.\"Why? First, because these vaccines will save lives and protect our health care system. They will end the pandemic and remove the always looming threat of lockdown and social disruption. They will allow us to hug again!\" said Austriaco, who is currently on sabbatical as a visiting professor of biological sciences at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila.\"Second, because I trust the scientific process that has gone into the development and testing of these vaccines... Moreover, these vaccines rely on decades of research,\" he added.\n",
      "The Dominican microbiologist said these vaccines \"were developed in record time.\"\"But that is what you would expect when scientists have unlimited funding to support their experiments and no other burdens to deal with like writing and revising grant proposal after grant proposal in small incremental steps. It is not like scientists just woke up one morning at the beginning of the pandemic and started from scratch. We have known about mRNA for over 50 years, and we know how it is made, used, and destroyed in the cell. We have known about RNA viruses for decades as well, including the subclass of RNA viruses that are called coronaviruses,\" said the Dominican priest, who obtained a doctorate in biology from the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a fellow of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.According to Austriaco, the \"decades of experiments and countless sleepless nights by tens of thousands of scientists who spent hours and hours toiling at the bench form the bedrock of the vaccines that are now being deployed around the world.\"\"A lot of great science went into these vaccines and a lot of great scientists were needed to generate that great science,\" he added.While there are those who questioned about the speed of the vaccine testing, Austriaco maintained that \"these vaccines are safe and efficacious.\"\"And in the end, the numbers say it all. And what the numbers say is that. Tens of thousands were tested and they developed an appropriate immune response to the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Tens of thousands were tested and none got very ill or died from the vaccines,\" he added.Debunking unscientific claimsAs to whether these vaccines have side effects, Austriaco answered: \"Absolutely! That is what the clinical trials have also shown. I expect to have a sore arm for a day or so. I expect to have a fever and to feel worn out for a time.\"\"But these are signs that the vaccine is working! These are signs that the vaccine is jumpstarting my immune response so that I can make those precious antibodies that will wipe out the Covid-19 virus if I am exposed to them for real in the future,\" he said.\"And the pain and discomfort and just plain inconvenience do not compare with what I would experience if I did get a severe case of Covid-19, or God forbid, with what someone else would experience if I infected them with Covid-19 and they ended up in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). As a Christian, I am taught that a broken world can only be redeemed by sacrifice. This is the meaning of the Cross. In my view, the few days of discomfort and downright crappiness that I expect to experience after each dose of the Covid-19 vaccine will be my contribution to the sacrifice that heals the world (cf. Col 1:24),\" he wrote.While there were reports about rare allergic reactions to the virus, the priest-microbiologist maintained that there is a solution to it.\"In the first two weeks of the vaccination campaign in the USA, 21 cases of severe allergic responses were recorded among 1,893,360 vaccinations. Most of these allergic responses (71 percent) occurred within 15 minutes of injection. Am I concerned? Not really. First, I have not experienced severe allergic responses before. The 21 people who experienced a response to the Covid-19 jab had a history of bad allergic responses. So it is unlikely that I will experience this reaction myself,\" he said.According to Austriaco, the solution to these allergic responses is called the EpiPen.\"I have had students who walk around campus with an EpiPen because they know that they are prone to allergic responses. Here in the Philippines, we plan to have EpiPens available everywhere we do vaccinations. So we will be ready. If I or someone else gets an allergic response, we will jab them with that EpiPen!\" he added.On the few reports of people who died days or weeks after receiving the vaccine, the priest-scientist maintained that \"there is no evidence whatsoever that these individuals died because of the vaccine.\"\"We are vaccinating millions of people around the world right now, so we should expect some to die within a few weeks after receiving the vaccine. Why? Because people die. Especially elderly people. It was just their time, whether or not they had received the vaccine or not,\" he said.He also debunked the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine will make women infertile, saying \"this claim is unreasonable and not supported by the science.\"\"Moreover, if an antibody response against Covid-19 triggers a response against the human placenta, then we would expect that Covid-19 would trigger miscarriages as the body attacked the placenta while attacking the virus. No increase in miscarriages has been seen among the 45,000+ pregnant women who have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 since the beginning of the pandemic,\" he said.\"Finally, there are reports of women becoming pregnant during the vaccine clinical trials after they had developed an immune response against the Sars-CoV-2 virus. This demonstrates that they were not rendered infertile by the vaccine,\" he added.On the fear that the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines will change one's genes, he maintained that \"this claim is unreasonable and not supported by any science.\"\"For the most part, every human cell has hundreds of thousands of copies of its own mRNA at any one moment in time. We have never seen these mRNAs encoded back into DNA and reinserted back into the human being's DNA, even when the cell is infected with an RNA virus that has the enzyme or molecular machine called reverse transcriptase, which is necessary for making RNA into DNA. If this claim were true, then human cells infected with an RNA virus would contain new DNA from the person's mRNA. Again, this has never been seen,\" Austriaco said.As a priest-scientist, he said he has to \"respect the evidence, whether it is the data of science or the data of divine revelation, and there simply is no evidence that mRNA vaccines will reprogram our genes.\"\"Finally, I have to address the moral complications raised by the fetal cell lines derived from an abortion decades ago that were used to manufacture some of the Covid-19 vaccines. As a priest, I know that different people have different thresholds of sensitivity to evil. Some feel evil exquisitely. Others not so much. We should therefore expect different people to reach different moral conclusions that could even be opposed to each other while both remaining virtuous responses.\"Personally, I will choose to avoid the vaccines made with these cell lines. However, as the Vatican itself has noted, it is not immoral to avail oneself of these morally controversial vaccines, especially if no other options are available.\"In the end, I believe that the unprecedented, and really, unexpected, successes we have witnessed in the production of these vaccines are a blessing from the Lord,\" he wrote.Cases of coronavirus, which affected 218 countries and territories around the globe after its first recorded infection in Wuhan, China in December 2019 have already reached 90,879,255, as of January 11, 2021.The virus has killed 1,946,619 people worldwide, while 64,974,697 have recovered.

      "ALMOST 2,500 healthcare workers at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) are willing to be vaccinated against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), Department of Health Central Visayas (DOH 7) spokesperson Mary Jean Loreche announced Monday, Feb. 8, 2021.She said the VSMMC, a tertiary government hospital in Cebu City, listed 2,987 healthcare workers as priority recipients of the vaccine.\n",
      "Of this number, 2,480 have agreed to be inoculated.Loreche did not cite any reason for the refusal of the remaining 507 medical frontliners.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are expected to arrive in the country either on Feb. 15 or in the last week of February, Loreche said.\n",
      "She did not specify the number of doses allocated for Cebu City.Cebu City, together with Metro Manila and Davao City, were given top priority in the rollout of the vaccines in the country because of increasing cases of coronavirus infection.Loreche said they have started conducting seminars on the implementation of the national Covid-19 vaccination program.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said the Philippines will get 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine through the Covax initiative, a facility aimed at accelerating vaccine manufacturing and promoting vaccine equity globally.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is administered in two doses 28 days apart. Based on the results of its phase 3 clinical trials, the vaccine is 95 percent efficacious against Covid-19.Loreche said, however, that it’s not a guarantee that an individual will no longer contract Covid-19.\n",
      "Cebu City casesMeanwhile, she said it’s still too early to blame the rise in infections in Cebu on the B.1.1.7 or United Kingdom (UK) variant.Regardless, she said people should continue to comply with the minimum public health standards and quarantine protocols. A virus has the opportunity to mutate every time it is transmitted.“People have forgotten that we need to really have that close adherence to the public health protocols because there is no medicine for this,” she said.The new variants detected in the UK and South Africa were reported to be more contagious.Aside from strict compliance to health safety protocols, Loreche also said they will revisit testing policies if more new variant cases are found.She also said the DOH 7 was amenable to suggestions to use two face masks and stressed the need to wear face shields.As of Feb. 8, the active cases in Cebu City went up to 2,218, including 151 new infections. The Covid-19 death toll remained at 706 as no additional deaths were reported. There were 29 new recoveries, pushing the total to 10,701.The active cases in Cebu City comprise around half of the 4,465 active cases in Central Visayas, the DOH 7 case bulletin showed.Cumulative cases in the region since the start of the pandemic increased to 31,019 as of Feb. 8, including 1,493 deaths, 25,061 recoveries and 4,465 active cases.Info driveAt the Cebu City Health Department (CHD), officer-in-charge Jeffrey Ibones said they were focusing on an education and information drive to convince the public to get vaccinated not only against Covid-19 but also against other preventable diseases.He admitted, however, that this is difficult to achieve because of the Dengvaxia controversy. Dengvaxia is a vaccine against dengue fever, which was found in 2018 to cause severe illness in individuals who have not contracted the dengue virus.Ibones said audio-visual materials explaining the vaccination process and benefits of the vaccines will soon be available in barangay health centers and government offices.He also said they were drawing up a micro vaccination plan for Cebu City based on the national roadmap.During the regular session of the Cebu City Council on Feb. 3, 2021, National Task Force Against Covid-19 deputy implementer for the Visayas Melquiades Feliciano said different clusters have been formed to be part of the vaccine operations center.Ibones said the clusters included in the vaccine operations center have been meeting at the second floor of the old Sacred Heart School for Boys building, which is being eyed as the local vaccination operations center (VOC).Ibones said his office has yet to coordinate with the DOH on the requirements for a command center for the vaccination program.The Cebu City Government was given until Feb. 10 to submit its vaccination plan and activate all local VOCs.Other local government units given the same deadline are Metro Manila and Davao City.

      "Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje, as National VOC chairperson, gave the deadline in an advisory dated February 2.The health facilities covered by the directive are the Covid-19 referral hospitals, DOH hospitals, local government units, private Level 3 hospitals, and private Level 2 and 3 hospitals under the Armed Forces of the Philippines.The simulation should include tabletop exercises, drills, time and motion exercises, and/or full scale simulation activities.\n",
      "The microplans are to be submitted on or before February 10 to the Regional VOC, which will brief the National VOC during its regular meeting at 9 a.m. of February 10.“The Regional VOCs of NCR, Regions VII (Central Visayas) and XI (Davao) shall ensure the full activation and operationalization of all local VOCs of NCR, Cebu City and Davao City on or before February 10, 2021,” Cabotaje stated.The Regional VOCs will provide technical and supervisory assistance to the concerned health facilities.The NCR, Central Visayas and Davao Region have been given top priority in the deployment of vaccines because of their rising cases of infection.The government expects delivery of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and an undetermined volume from AstraZeneca in mid-February.An initial shipment of 50,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine is also expected on February 20.\n",
      "The arrival of these vaccines will kick off the Philippines’ mass vaccination program against Covid-19.The government aims to inoculate up to 70 million Filipinos in 2021, roughly 63 percent of the population, to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 and reopen the economy further.The National VOC is composed of the National Task Force Against Covid-19, DOH and the Department of the Interior and Local Government.

      "(This is the conclusion of the SunStar Philippines special report on efforts to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic through vaccination.)TWO recent surveys indicated that Filipinos have yet to overcome vaccine hesitancy arising from the Dengvaxia controversy.\n",
      "More than four out of 10, or 44.1 percent, of the 15,651 participants in the University of Santo Tomas Covid-19 vaccine awareness team survey either hesitated or said they will not / probably not get the vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).The survey was conducted from January 16 to 30, 2021 on several social media platforms. No reasons were given for their refusal to receive the vaccine.Six out of 10, or 55.9 percent, said yes / probably yes. Almost half of the respondents, or 45.7 percent, said they prefer the vaccines made in the United States (US) or Europe while 50.9 percent said they will use any safe and effective vaccine.\n",
      "A Pulse Asia survey conducted among 2,400 respondents from November 23 to December 2, 2020 also showed that nearly half, or 47 percent, said they will not get the vaccine.Nearly a third, or 32 percent, said they will get vaccinated while one in five, or 21 percent, were unsure.The results were worse in the Visayas and Mindanao, where 55 percent and 48 percent, respectively, said no.In terms of income classifications, 43 percent of class ABC, 46 percent of class D and 56 percent of class E said no.Concerns over the safety of the vaccine were cited as reason for refusal or hesitancy by more than eight of 10, or 84 percent, of the respondents.Vaccine hesitancy, or the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines, has been blamed for the low immunization rates in the country since the Department of Health (DOH) suspended its dengue vaccination program.\n",
      "The program was suspended on December 1, 2017 after vaccine maker Sanofi Pasteur revealed new findings that its anti-dengue product, Dengvaxia, poses greater risk of severe dengue fever to those who have not been previously infected with the virus.This led to the filing of cases against DOH officials, who were blamed for deaths believed to have been caused by Dengvaxia. Former DOH secretary Janette Garin and nine others were indicted for reckless imprudence.In 2019, DOH blamed vaccine hesitancy for the measles outbreak. Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease.In the first quarter of 2020, full immunization coverage in children hit a record low of 7.0 percent, less than a third of the quarterly target of 23 to 24 percent and about half of the 16 percent average pre-Covid-19 accomplishment.This was, however, also due to the pandemic-related lockdown.Fully aware of the challenges in the implementation of a vaccination program against Covid-19, the government has launched a massive information campaign.Transparency is keyDOH Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje, in a virtual learning session for the media on January 29, 2021, said transparency is the key factor in encouraging Filipinos to receive the vaccine against Covid-19.She asked that those who receive the vaccine first “spread the word” and help build public trust in vaccines.WHO consultant Suzanne Brownlow Kerba, in the same session, said health workers should be aware of possible side effects and explain these well to the public.She said the public may confuse these side effects with Covid-19 or flu symptoms and may worry that the vaccine gave them Covid-19.Kerba said health workers should emphasize to the patients that side effects indicate a good immune response, and are temporary.It is important that vaccine recipients return for the second dose even if they experience unpleasant side effects after the first dose, she added.She said adverse effects could include allergies to a component of the vaccine, quality defects in the vaccine, and human errors.The keys to effective communication are honesty, empathy, respect, humility, resolve and partnership.“We come back down to trust because if the people are not trusting what the DOH is saying, what the media is saying, we are in a quandary so those groups have to provide trust,” she said.Behavioral approachDr. Elisse Nicole Catalan, who has a master’s degree in public health from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said anxiety about the vaccine can be attributed to fear of the unknown, misinformation and distrust.She said the government's knee-jerk reaction to provide information without a behavioral approach is inadequate.“There needs to be a careful consideration of how people will consume the information and this same message should cleverly also act as a tool to assist in an individual’s decision-making process,” she said.She suggested the use of the “nudge theory”, or the behavioral economics concept of libertarian paternalism, to influence the public’s decision while respecting their freedom of choice.“How can this be done? People need to be shown that the direct result of their vaccination will benefit their communities, and contribute to attaining herd immunity that will allow us to go about our lives like we did in 2019 (e.g. mask-less, no lockdowns),” she said.“People need to know that if they refuse to be vaccinated, cases will continue to rise, bringing about the threat of a bigger outbreak that can result in more variants and mutations,” she added.Catalan also said the government needs to show exactly how the vaccination program will be conducted, and that it will be easy, accessible, and safe.“People need to know how the vaccinations will be conducted and what to expect. Will it be available in every barangay or district hospital?” she said.The government has drawn up a national deployment and vaccination plan, a detailed action plan to carry out the vaccination program over the next three years. Local government units (LGUs) have also been directed to localize this plan.Read: Special report: Government prepares for vaccine rolloutVaccine confidenceCatalan said the government can promote vaccine confidence by asking prominent figures, celebrities and athletes to help in the campaign.She noted that several first world leaders have come forward and were vaccinated publicly.In Indonesia, social media influencers were vaccinated and asked to spread the word about the vaccine.Several other countries encouraged vaccine recipients to share their personal experiences about the process.Catalan also said there should be a dedicated resource to address queries about possible reactions after inoculation and a clear plan on what one needs to do if he/she feels unwell after the jab.Under the deployment and vaccination plan, an incident command system will be established to monitor all vaccination-related concerns.Vaccine recipients will be monitored for 30 minutes to one hour after inoculation for any adverse reactions. If they experience adverse reactions after they’re cleared, they are to immediately inform a doctor or a barangay health worker, or go to a hospital.The government has adopted VigiFlow, a management system for recording, processing and sharing reports of adverse effects, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a virtual press conference on January 27.Trainings have also been conducted to capacitate healthcare workers and alert them to any adverse events.Vaccine operations centers have been established in all regional offices and town hall meetings to increase vaccine awareness were being conducted, Vergeire added.Catalan said there needs to be a multi-sectoral effort to encourage all citizens to get vaccinated.Both the public and private sectors must target communications to different segments of the population, and recognize the need to communicate in all major languages and dialects in the country.She suggested that telecommunications companies be asked to provide reminders and factoids via text messages and e-commerce apps display nudges to the public while people online shop.“This pandemic is one war we all need to win together. We have no choice but to fully commit and go all in. This virus has crippled our lives and livelihood for a year and counting. We can’t afford a moment more,” she added.

      "ASIDE from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Inc., the Davao City Government is also negotiating with Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Johnson & Johnson) for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines, the city's Covid-19 focal person, Dr. Ashley Lopez, confirmed.In a radio interview on Wednesday, January 27, 2021, Lopez said the city is also in talks with Janssen for the possible procurement of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.\n",
      "\"Ako nahibaw-an katong gipa-reserve sa atong mayor (Sara Duterte-Carpio), katong AstraZeneca and J&J... Johnson & Johnson nga brand (Based on the initial information I received, the mayor will be reserving for cold chain storage vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson),\" the health official said in an interview on 87.5 FM Davao City Disaster Radio.Lopez said just like AstraZeneca, vaccines from Janssen are expected to arrive by third quarter of this year.The health official said this is on top of the Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccines that the city will be receiving from the National Government.\n",
      "Initial doses of the vaccine are expected to arrive in late February this year.Medical frontliners, especially working at the Southern Philippines Medical Center, will be prioritized for the Pfizer vaccine.Lopez said that at present, the City Government is looking for a cold chain storage facility for the vaccines.\n",
      "He said they are scouting for a separate cold storage area for Pfizer-BioNTech, which requires a -70 degree Celsius storage temperature.Lopez admitted that the Department of Health (DOH)-Davao and the City Health Office do not have a storage area with the temperature required for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. But the National Government is under negotiation with several logistics and cold storage facilities that have the facilities and extensive experience to handle the vaccine, including Zuellig Pharma Corporation.Lopez said Zuellig has a branch in Davao City.\n",
      "He said he already talked to DOH-Davao Director Annabelle Yumang and they are arranging their schedule for ocular inspection in one of Zuellig's facilities in the city.As of Wednesday, January 27, only AstraZeneca has a signed agreement with the city and national government for the procurement of vaccines.Meanwhile, Lopez said the city is already preparing for the immunization.\"Although ato preparation sa immunization is dili pud basta-basta. It will take time sa preparation pa lang. More or less, mahinay-hinayan nato og hapsay ang proseso sa pagbakuna (The preparation for immunization is no easy task. It will take time. What we have to do is iron out the procedure and implementation of the vaccination program),\" the official said.He said they are still planning on how and where the vaccines will be rolled out once these arrive.Lopez said they are also preparing to attend to those who may experience side effects from the vaccines.The Davao City Vaccination Program, which provides the guidelines and policies on vaccine inoculation in the city, has been passed under second reading.Duterte-Carpio earlier announced that the city will also be scheduling an online registration for Dabawenyos who are willing to get the Covid-19 vaccine.The city is targeting to immunize an estimated 1.2 million people to achieve herd immunity.\n",

      "The biggest news this week in the war against Covid-19 is Britain’s kick-off of its mass vaccination program on Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2020. Margaret Keenan, 90, was the first to get a jab and Filipina nurse May Parsons got a bit of the limelight for doing the job.The United States has not done so yet as the Food and Drug Administration is still assessing vaccine candidates, though the virus continues to threaten lives. A White House spokesperson, noting of the winter months, was not so reassuring, stating that the pandemic will be “the worst event that this country will face, not just from a public health side.” The Johns Hopkins University data revealed that the average daily infection in the US is approaching 200,000 at the latest.\n",
      "And the Philippines? While most countries have made advance orders for the vaccine long before its availability, Congress is still debating on the budget. It is reported that the country has yet to finalize its order of the vaccine. One report said the government is still evaluating on whether to order the vaccines from China or Russia and 10 other suppliers. With the high demand for the vaccine and the limited capacity of manufacturers, it may well be that the Philippines is at the tail end of most of the suppliers’ lists.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, citing a best-case scenario, said a vaccine would become available between April and June 2021, and that it may not be until late 2021 or early 2022 for the government to obtain a vaccine for local distribution.If we make Britain’s rollout as a starting point, the Philippines will have its first jab four months late. According to the World Health Organization report 63 on the Philippines dated Nov. 25: “In the past weeks, there seem to have been a decrease in daily reported cases, deaths and recoveries by as much as 25%.” At that time the data revealed: 422,915 infected and 8,215 confirmed deaths. While the numbers pale in comparison to the United States, we simply can’t remain complacent.\n",
      "Already, people are wanting to move on with their lives. In New Zealand where I live, it is back-to-normal, though border restrictions remain. While there are still Covid-19 cases, these are confined in quarantine facilities for citizens, residents and a few exceptions coming from overseas. There has been no community transmission for some time. The same is true in Taiwan whose efficient public health infrastructure and disciplined public prevented a national lockdown that New Zealand adopted.Other than New Zealand and Taiwan, the Covid-19 Global Response Index mentions Senegal, Iceland, Denmark and Saudi Arabia as models in disease management and prevention.The pandemic tested the abilities of national leaders and the capabilities of their citizenry in coping with crisis. There were a few who succeeded, while many others utterly failed. With the vaccine, all should be well. How soon? That is yet another challenge for leaders.\n",

      "THE Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against Covid-19 (HPAAC) on Friday, February 12, 2021, expressed strong opposition to a Senate bill that aims to give local government units (LGUs) direct access to vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).In a statement, the HPAAC said Senate Bill 2042 will only localize the global vaccine inequity and worsen the public health crisis in the country.\n",
      "\"We aggravate this inequity by doing the same thing locally - distributed geographically according to capacity to pay,” the group said.\"Mortality will continue unabated, perhaps even increase. The health system will be overwhelmed, and the lockdown will persist pushing our country deeper into economic ruin,\" it warned.Citing the World Health Organization (WHO) statement, the group said that of the nearly 200 million people who have been vaccinated around the world, 75 percent belong to 10 rich countries.\n",
      "At least 130 countries have not vaccinated a single person.If the bill is passed, rich LGUs may be able to procure more vaccines first and poor LGUs would be pushed to the end of the queue.\"Vaccines are not a local resource. Prioritization and distribution requires centralized orchestration. This intensifies when supplies are inadequate, as is the case with requirement is Covid-19 vaccines,\" the group stressed.\"When LGUs and corporations are allowed to procure on their own, then priorities will be defined by capacity to pay rather than need for the vaccine,\" it added.Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri had filed SB2042, which aims to expedite the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines by LGUs.At present, LGUs may procure vaccines through the national government.\n",

      "UNLESS the Philippine government will approve certain Covid-19 vaccine brands to be used in the country, Davao City Mayor Sara Z. Duterte-Carpio said the local government cannot proceed with its vaccination program for the city.Duterte-Carpio on Friday, December 11, 2020, said the City Government had been reaching out to vaccine manufacturers in a bid to gain access to the vaccine after it drafted a localized vaccine program.\n",
      "She recently said the city government has enough funds to purchase the Covid-19 vaccines.The mayor admitted that it will involve a lengthy process as no vaccine has been granted approval yet by the national government. There is also no guideline yet if the local government units (LGUs) will be allowed to coordinate with vaccine manufacturers on their own.In a previous report, the mayor said the City Government first approached an official of one of the drug companies, who told her to formally write to them but later on replied that it is not for profit and would only set it to the Department of Health (DOH).\n",
      "The other company encouraged the city government to participate in Phase 3 of the clinical trial.In her latest interview, she said another foreign drug official reached out to her days after her pronouncement on the city's move to buy vaccines. The mayor said their country allows them \"to sell [the vaccines] to whoever is the buyer.\"The official, however, said they cannot deliver the vaccines in the country since it needs approval from DOH and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).As of Friday, the national government has not granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to any vaccine brands.An EUA is a formal document that will speed up the processing time for approval of a certain vaccine, particularly for Covid-19, that will enter the country – from six months to 21 days.President Rodrigo Duterte in early December signed Executive Order (EO) No. 121, which grants FDA the authority to issue EUA for Covid-19 treatment drugs and vaccines that are still under development.\n",
      "\"We are waiting for that document so that we may know what brand sa mga (of) vaccines ang gitagaan og EUA sa national government so that maka-pursue pud ta sa ila (that could have been granted EUA by the national government so that we could pursue to them as well),\" Duterte-Carpio said.For now, the mayor said all their negotiations are only “explanatory talks,” adding that having an authorization document could help them in their negotiations with vaccine-makers.The mayor said the local government deemed that they have \"local options\" in accessing the vaccines to help the national government in expediting vaccine access faster within localities.\"Naga-try na ta og seek out og mga kompanya nga makita nato sa mga balita nga duna nay mga bakuna because wala may mawala sa atoa if they say no (We are trying to seek out companies, based on news reports, that have already produced the vaccines. It will not be a loss if they will turn down our request) because we are already in the middle of this pandemic.

      "THE public has been urged to get the influenza and pneumonia vaccines to help the immune system fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, Department of Health (DOH) 7 spokesperson, said studies have shown that an individual immunized against influenza has a better immune response when exposed to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\n",
      "“There is cross-reactivity of immunity between flu and coronavirus due to the similarity of their structures,” she said.Cross reactivity means the influenza virus and Sars-CoV-2 have some degrees of similarity in their antigenic structures.The immune system of the individual will recognize Sars-CoV-2 and mount a response against it, thereby affording some form of immunity, she said.\n",
      "According to the DOH, influenza, or flu, is caused by the influenza virus that enters the body via droplets from an infected person through coughing, talking and sneezing or through contact with contaminated surfaces.As for the pneumonia or pneumococcal vaccine, she said it targets one of the most virulent causative agents of pneumonia caused by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium.However, she said they are still consolidating the data for 2020 to find out how many people got the flu and pneumoccocal vaccines.\n",
      "Last year, 47,707 individuals got the flu vaccine and 23,083 got the pneumococcal vaccine in Central Visayas.In Cebu City, 44 of its 80 barangays have not recorded any new Covid-19 case as of Friday, Oct. 23, 2020.Of that number, four barangays never had a history of Covid-19 transmission.\n",
      "Mayor Edgardo Labella recently challenged the 36 remaining barangays with active cases to eliminate the disease. He said he would give a P100,000 reward to barangays that report zero transmission between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31.Inayawan Barangay Captain Kirk Bryan Repollo said he is up to the challenge, adding that it has been the goal of every barangay to get rid of the infection.To achieve this, though, Repollo said barangays need the City’s support and not just financial incentives. He said politics continues to be a stumbling block.Inayawan has one active Covid-19 case.Labangon Barangay Captain Victor Buendia, who is also the Association of Barangay Councils vice president, described Labella’s challenge as “near to impossible.”He said having no discretion on what measures to implement in his own barangay continues to pose a problem.“We are not in full control of our barangay. Sa Bisaya pa, dili mi pabuoton unsa among buhaton sa among barangay,” he said.Labangon has three active cases.Apas Barangay Captain Virgil Cabigon said achieving zero transmission may not be so easy, especially since his barangay is home to a number of business process outsourcing companies.Sambag 2 Barangay Captain Ryan Aznar, for his part, said they’ve always been vigilant to arrest the spread of Covid-19.“Even without the reward, we are always vigilant,” he said.Cogon Pardo Barangay Captain Harry Eran said the financial incentive can help his barangay, which has limited resources in fighting the pandemic.“Any funds that our barangay may receive can greatly ease our problem in sourcing funds for our daily Covid-19-related activities,” he said.According to the data of the Emergency Operations Center, Cebu City had 196 active cases, as of Oct. 23.Of the 10,201 Covid-19 cases in the city, 9,325 have recovered while 677 have died.

      "SECRETARY Carlito Galvez Jr., Malacañang’s vaccine czar, once again assured that Bacolod City is one of the priority cities of the national government in the vaccine distribution.“Don’t worry because Bacolod City is our priority after Cebu City and afterward, Iloilo City,” Galvez told the virtual special general assembly of the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP), led by Bacolod City Mayor Evelio Leonardia as national president, Thursday, February 4.\n",
      "“All the highly urbanized cities (HUCs) are priorities; we will not leave anyone behind,” Galvez added.In November 2020, Galvez, who is also the chief implementer of the National Task Force Against Covid-19, had informed Leonardia via text message that Bacolod is among the local government units (LGUs) in the country poised to first receive the Covid-19 vaccine in case the national government gets a hold of its supply.The LCP held a special assembly with Galvez and lawyer Michael Aguinaldo, chair of the Commission on Audit (COA), for an orientation on the COA guidance for the availment of Covid-19 vaccines by cities.\n",
      "Galvez said their strategy is to have more than what is needed in case a slippage happens in the production of the vaccines and to avoid competing with other countries as well.According to the vaccine czar, LGUs must let the national government procure the necessary vaccines so that they can focus on the vaccination campaign and the implementation of the vaccination plan.“It’s much better if you focus on the implementation and inoculation on our citizens,” Galvez said.\n",
      "Before the Covid-19 vaccines reach the LGUs, transactions between their manufacturers and the national government must be done first.Leonardia told Galvez: “I would like to express our deepest appreciation.

      "Aguinaldo, in giving guidance to the city mayors, said: “I had to issue notes on the guidelines on the auditors to remind them that we are still under a pandemic situation and that they should always consider that in conducting the audit.”Leonardia told Aguinaldo that LCP would prefer that the national government will do the negotiation and procurement with the vaccine companies while the LGUs will simply reimburse the national government. Aguinaldo expressed openness to the proposition but suggested that everybody should wait for what exactly will be the final arrangements.Manila City Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso, for his part, said: “The logic is to achieve our goal which is the herd immunity concept. The earlier, the better — as long as it is certified by local agencies like the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).”The general assembly was participated in by 77 cities including 58 mayors.Among those in attendance were LCP Secretary-General and Calapan City Mayor Arnan Panaligan; LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment chair Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas; vice chair General Santos City Mayor Ronnel Rivera; and members Public Relations Officer Ormoc City Mayor Richard Gomez, Bacoor City Mayor Lani Mercado, Balanga City Mayor Francis Anthony Garcia, Zamboanga City Mayor Beng Climaco, and Candon City Mayor Ericson Singson, Tangub City Mayor Jennifer Tan, Pagadian City Mayor Samuel Co; and LCP Focal Mayor for Environment, Climate Change, and DRRM Mayor Noel Rosal of Legazpi City, LCP executive director Veronica Hitosis, and other LCP officials.

      "RUSSIA has claimed that it has already produced the first vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According to its official website, Sputnik V is a Russian adenovirus vector-based vaccine that was registered by the Russian Ministry of Health on August 11 and \"became the first registered Covid-19 vaccine on the market.\"\n",
      "Aside from Sputnik V, there are some 165 vaccines being developed around the world. These vaccines also differ from one another: viral vector-based vaccines, virus-based, nucleic acid-based, and protein-based vaccines.While the knowledge that a vaccine will be available to everyone soon, the distribution of the vaccine is more complicated than we think. How will the vaccine supply chain cope with global demand? How can vaccine manufacturers ensure the quality while mass producing the vaccine? Who are the priority sectors for the first batch of vaccination?The Philippines cannot simply purchase or ask donations of vaccines. What it also needs is a comprehensive vaccination program for Covid-19, which the government has yet to present to the Filipinos.\n",
      "So far, what we are getting from our government leaders, including the president, is there will be a vaccine soon, who will be the possible priority sectors to receive it, and the estimated budget to procure it. However, there is no comprehensive plan for the country's Covid-19 vaccination program yet.We saw how our government's seemingly reactive response to the Covid-19 pandemic led to having the most cases in Southeast Asia and having the longest lockdown in the region. Therefore, while the vaccines are being developed and finalized, it is a good time for the government to be proactive and start coming up with a concrete plan on how the vaccination program will be for the Philippines.Definitely, we are hoping that the government will first provide vaccination to the health workers, who have been tirelessly working in treating Covid-19 patients in the hospitals. They very much deserve to be the first batch to receive the vaccine because they are the ones who are dealing with Covid-19 patients. In a sense, it is also cost-effective if the government vaccinates the health workers and other frontline workers first.However, in a Philippine News Agency report on August 3, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte said the police and the military would be among the first to receive vaccines, noting that he needs \"a strong backbone.\" He also said underprivileged Filipinos would also be prioritized. Sadly, there was no mention of prioritizing health workers. It is not like the police and military will take over the treatment of Covid-19 patients when the government fails to vaccinate the health workers and they all get infected with the virus.The government also needs to consider the cost of the vaccination.However, it seems like the government has this covered already.\n",
      "Department of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said the government can set aside P20 billion to buy the vaccine. Funding will be sourced with the help of the Philippine International Trading Corp., Land Bank of the Philippines, and the Development Bank of the Philippines.The President also said the vaccination will be free for the poor, police, and military while the rich and drug personalities will pay for theirs. How about the middle-class Filipinos, overseas Filipino workers, and health workers? There is no mention if their vaccination will be free, subsidized, or will they pay for it?However, the funding seems like for the initial phase of the vaccination only. What are the government's plans post Covid-19 pandemic?There are also the questions on who will administer the vaccine. Will the DOH be the one to do it? Will it be coursed through the designated Covid-19 hospitals in the country?While the country waits for a vaccine, the government should use this time to develop a comprehensive plan on Covid-19 vaccination. The plan must provide in detail how the government plans to procure the vaccine, source funding for it, its distribution, and the priority sectors that will receive it. This is to ensure there is a smooth distribution of vaccines and also to prepare the different sectors who will be involved in this.\n",

      "GOVERNOR Dennis \"Delta\" Pineda is leading the efforts of the provincial government to raise an initial P200 million to P300 million to be able to purchase doses of anti-Covid-19 vaccine and immunize priority sectors in the province.“Kailangan po nating magtulong-tulong para makabili ng epektibong anti-Covid-19 vaccine. Hindi po puwedeng iasa ang lahat sa national government (We need to help each other to be able to buy an effective vaccine against COVID-19. We cannot rely solely on the national government to do the vaccination program),” Pineda said on Sunday, December 27, 2020.\n",
      "He said the vaccine should be administered before the second quarter of 2021 to medical frontliners in public and private hospitals handling Covid-19 patients, as well as to workers in private companies to strengthen the capacity of the health system while restarting the economy.These groups would consist of the first batch of recipients of vaccine allotments from the national and provincial governments.For the multi-sectoral fund drive, Pineda urged local executives and legislative councils in 19 towns and three cities to appropriate funds for the vaccination program.\n",
      "He said Vice Governor Lilia Pineda and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan are supportive of larger allocation proposals from him.“We will all have to sacrifice some projects to prioritize further the health needs of our constituents,” the governor said.He is set to begin dialogues with the business sector, which is encouraged to put up counterpart funding and launch other means.He said the brand of vaccine should be approved by appropriate health authorities and purchased per the government’s procurement law.In a meeting on December 18, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and provincial officials discussed ways to help the local economy recover from the pandemic.As a consultant to the provincial government, Arroyo recommended the clustering of barangays in enforcing health protocols, with councilors overseeing the clusters.\n",

      "THE Covid-19 vaccines bring new hope to the ailing economy both in health and wealth.Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Steven Yu said the private sector is helping the government by working towards reopening the economy and implementing Covid-19 vaccinations.\n",
      "“We should help push our way to overcoming this pandemic,” he said.Despite the gloomy start of 2021 due to the second wave of coronavirus infections in western countries, Yu said there is light at the end of the tunnel because of the availability of the Covid-19 vaccine, no matter how limited it may be for now.“Compared with last year, we also have a better understanding of the virus and the tools to test, trace and treat. We, in Cebu, have enough quarantine and health care facilities to treat the novel coronavirus. There is a spike in cases but it is far from the peak that we experienced before,” he said.\n",
      "Yu said the challenge that remains vital is how to reopen the economy continuously and safely.“Economically, yes, we are deeply scarred. But from here, the optimism comes in, because we have tested the bottom,” Yu said.He said that achieving herd immunity through inoculation should be the ultimate goal, so the country can freely open the borders and drive consumption.Procurement progressVaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. on Jan. 11, 2021, said the national and local governments have signed agreements for the supply of over 30 million doses of candidate vaccines against Covid-19.Negotiations are ongoing for over 100 million doses more, he said.\n",
      "The target is to import a total of 148 million doses to inoculate 70 million citizens in 2021, Galvez told the Senate committee of the whole on Jan. 11.As of Jan. 11, Galvez said the confirmed supply agreements were those signed with AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India, through its Philippine partner Faberco Life Sciences Inc.However, these will be available in the third quarter of 2021, at the earliest.Moreover, the government is also now in the final stages of negotiation with American biotechnology company Moderna for the procurement of up to 20 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccines.Eagerly waitingMeanwhile, Alfred Reyes, vice president of the Hotel, Resort and Restaurant Association of Cebu (HRRAC) said the tourism industry is eagerly waiting for the arrival of the vaccine.Reyes said the vaccine would spell immunity and with it comes the reopening of borders to allow entry of foreign tourists.“We hope we can bounce back by the third and fourth quarter of 2021. Once the people will again have the confidence, that’s the time people will start traveling again,” he said.Reyes said there is now hope since the vaccine has been discovered. It is just a matter of time that the vaccine will arrive in the Philippines. (JOB)\n"

      "DAVAO City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio said on Friday, January 8, 2021, that the City Government will be getting its Covid-19 vaccines from multiple sources since relying on one vaccine manufacturing can pose a logistical problem.Based on the city's estimated population, which is around 1.8 million, Duterte-Carpio said at least 1.2 million Dabawenyos are targeted to be administered with Covid-19 vaccine to achieve \"herd immunity.\"\n",
      "\"Assuming na tag two doses ni nga bakuna, walay makahatag og (Assuming that the approved vaccine will require two doses, no company can provide) 2.4 million doses. Walay makadeliver og ingon ana to a single city by any vaccine maker sa pagkakaron (No vaccine maker can commit to produce that number to a single city as of now),\" Duterte-Carpio said in a radio interview on 87.5 FM Davao City Disaster Radio on Friday, January 8, 2020.Duterte-Carpio said the city will continue negotiating with other vaccine companies to be able to achieve its goal of vaccinating at least 1.2 million residents of the city.She added they will prioritize talks with companies that intend to apply for emergency use authorization (EUA) and product registration in the country.\n",
      "\"We will ask them if they can deliver this number of doses. If they will say yes, then we will start the process of contracting with other companies. We will be buying all the vaccines that may be sold to us by the different vaccine makers,\" Duterte-Carpio said.Procuring different vaccines, she said, also serves as a precautionary measure.\"Because tanang vaccines, pinaspasay ang pagkabuhat. In the event duna isa ka bakuna ang magkaproblema, duna side effect (Because all vaccines\n",
      "are made in a short amount of time, some of it may cause side effects), we do not know the long-term issues nga ma-encounter sa tanang mabakunahan, dili tanan sa atong residente ang apektado because lahi-lahing bakuna ang atong gi-access (some people may experience, at least not all of our residents will encounter the same side effects because we have access to different vaccines),\" the mayor said.The mayor also said there will be \"no limit\" when it comes to spending for the Covid-19 vaccine because of the city's goal to achieve herd immunity.AstraZeneca\n",
      "Duterte-Carpio said the city had formally started their negotiations with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Inc., a British-Swedish bio-pharmaceutical company.The 19th City Council, on Friday, January 8, approved an ordinance authorizing the city mayor to enter into and sign for and on behalf of the City Government the multilateral agreement between AstraZeneca, Philippine government, Department of Health, and city government for the procurement and acquisition of AZD1222 Vaccine.During the meeting on Friday morning, the mayor said the city was able to secure AstraZeneca's commitment to supply vaccines to the city.However, the mayor clarified that this will not be directly delivered to the city. The vaccines have to go through the national government's regulatory process and approval first.According to the AstraZeneca representatives, the vaccines may be available around the third quarter of 2021.\"But ingon ang AstraZeneca dili sila maka deliver og (But AstraZeneca told us they cannot deliver vaccines in) bulk supply, so it will be delivered in tranches, batches. But remember that our order with them is just an augmentation for the Philippine Vaccination Program of the national government,\" the mayor said.When asked why the city chose to formally negotiate with AstraZeneca, Duterte-Carpio said, \"Because sila lang ang ready na magpirma og mga kontrata (they are ready to sign contracts) with LGU (local government units).\"The mayor, however, said the city had already scheduled another meeting with other firms, which she did not disclose.But she added that the pharmaceutical company said its representatives are willing to talk with the city on the possible procurement of the vaccines.AstraZeneca Philippines Medical Affairs Director Dr. Cyril Tolosa, meanwhile, said in a special session in the City Council on Friday, January 8, that their vaccines are \"well-tolerated,\" wherein most people will not experience side effects.\"It showed and demonstrated based on a clinical trial that is well tolerated by the human body,\" Tolosa said.But he said, \"We're not saying this is 100 percent, meaning there will be no side effect. Even with the current drugs that we are using, there will always be side effects.\"Among the possible side effects that people might experience are fever and chills, which are usual side effects if vaccinated. He said this can be remedied by taking paracetamol.\n",

      "THE government-owned Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) will get an initial 1,900 doses from the initial shipment of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).The initial shipment of 114,000 doses for the entire Philippines is expected to arrive between Feb. 12 and Feb. 15, 2021, Department of Health Central Visayas (DOH 7) Director Jaime Bernadas said in a press conference on Wednesday, Feb. 10.\n",
      "VSMMC hospital administrator Gerardo Aquino Jr. said the number of employees who have agreed to be inoculated has increased to 2,904.Given that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine must be administered in two doses 28 days apart, VSMMC would need 5,808 doses.Aquino said the vaccination site at VSMMC will be the Center of Behavioral Sciences. Two floors will be utilized — the ground floor as the vaccination area and the second floor for the registration.\n",
      "The healthcare frontliners at the VSMMC have been prioritized for vaccination due to the rising cases of infection in Cebu City.SimulationThe DOH, together with the Office of Civil Defense (OCD), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and VSMMC, conducted a simulation of the vaccination procedures on Feb. 9.OCD 7 Director Marlou Salazar said some procedures needed to be improved such as transport of vaccines from the plane to the reefer van, how the vaccines were handled, convoy movement, and receiving the vaccines at VSMMC.“These are the major events that should be improved. In general, we have to improve our system,” said Salazar.Bernadas also said devices that monitor the temperature should be visible during transit. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at -80 to -60 degrees Celsius during transit.\n",
      "During the simulation, it took 70 minutes to bring the vaccines to the VSMMC from the airport, said DOH 7 spokesperson Mary Jean Loreche.Loreche said a specific timeframe must be set for the unloading of the vaccines at the airport and at the hospital.“This was highlighted yesterday so all of these must be in place so that the temperature of the vaccines shall be preserved as it comes and during transit,” said Bernadas.Overall, Bernadas said the simulation exercise was “successful.”Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Assistant Secretary Jonji Gonzales said the government targets to complete the vaccination program in 10 to 12 months, provided vaccines are available.Gonzales said Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Michael Lloyd Dino has decided to put up a vaccine action center at Oakridge where a daily briefing, including education and information efforts about the vaccine, will be conducted by Loreche.Gonzales said the center will serve as venue for all the coordination meetings related to the vaccination program as well as a database facility.Covid-19 beds in Cebu CityIndependent research group Octa Research warned that Covid beds utilization in Cebu City hospitals could reach the critical level of 70 percent in two weeks.Bed occupancy is still manageable at 40 percent as of Feb. 7, higher than the 25 percent a month ago.The group said that while they are confident that Cebu City and the province are now “better prepared” to deal with the current increase in cases, the possibility of the more infectious B.1.1.7 or United Kingdom variant spreading is a “game changer” as this will require more aggressive interventions.In its Feb. 9 report, the group said Cebu City averaged more than 120 new cases daily from Feb. 1 to 7, a 30 percent increase from the previous week.It also said the positivity rate, or the number of positive results from the number of samples tested, has increased to 10 percent in Cebu City. The attack rate jumped to 11.11 from 10 per 100,000 population.These factors, Octa Research said, classify Cebu City as a high risk area per DOH guidelines.The positivity rates in the cities of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu were higher at 15 percent.On Wednesday, Loreche debunked rumors that Cebu already had a confirmed case of the South African variant of the coronavirus.What Cebu has, she said, is only one confirmed case of the U.K B.1.1.7 variant, the 54-year-old male overseas Filipino worker from Dubai who has a residence in Talisay City. He was asymptomatic and already declared clinically recovered before he was released from isolation. (JJL / WBS)\n"

      "He said this policy can be considered discriminatory since there is limited supply of vaccines.Earlier, the Associated Labor Union (ALU) said they have received reports from workers in the agriculture, manufacturing and services (hotels, restaurants and call centers) sector that their employers were requiring them to get vaccinated.ALU-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines spokesperson Alan Tanjusay said they will help the workers file complaints against their employers who would implement the no vaccine, no work policy.\n",

      "The research could also bring scientists closer to an answer to one of the big questions about the vaccination drive: Will the vaccines actually curb the spread of the coronavirus?It's not clear what implications, if any, the findings might have for the two other major vaccines being used in the West, Pfizer's and Moderna's.In the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, dismissed the idea of deliberately delaying second shots, saying the US will \"go by the science\" and data from the clinical trials. The two doses of the Pifzer and Moderna vaccines are supposed to be given three and four weeks apart.\n",
      "Still, the research appears to be good news in the desperate effort to arrest the spread of the virus and also suggests a way to ease vaccine shortages and get shots into more arms more quickly.The makers of all three vaccines have said that their shots proved to be anywhere from 70 percent to 95 percent effective in clinical trials in protecting people from illness caused by the virus. But it was unclear whether the vaccines could also suppress transmission of the virus -- that is, whether someone inoculated could still acquire the virus without getting sick and spread it to others.As a result, experts have been saying that even people who have been vaccinated should continue to wear masks and keep their distance from others.Volunteers in the British study underwent regular nasal swabs to check for the coronavirus, a proxy to try to answer the transmission question. The level of virus-positive swabs - combining volunteers who had asymptomatic infection with those who had symptoms - was 67 percent lower in the vaccinated group, the researchers reported.While not a direct measure, \"that's got to have a really beneficial effect on transmission,\" Oxford lead researcher Sarah Gilbert told a meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences Wednesday.The researchers also looked at how likely people who have been vaccinated are to get a symptom-free infection. In one subset of volunteers, there were 16 asymptomatic infections among the vaccinated and 31 in an unvaccinated comparison group.\n",
      "Pfizer and Moderna also are studying the effect of their vaccines on asymptomatic infections.Only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are being used in the United States. Britain is using both AstraZeneca's and Pfizer's. AstraZeneca's has also been authorized by the 27-nation European Union. Pfizer has not endorsed the British government's decision to lengthen the time between doses.Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, said that no patients experienced severe Covid-19 or required hospitalization three weeks after receiving a first dose, and that effectiveness appeared to increase up to 12 weeks after the initial shot.\"Our data suggest you want to be as close to the 12 weeks as you can\" for the second dose, Pangalos said.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the study \"backs the strategy that we've taken\" to make sure more people have gotten at least one shot. Britain's decision has been criticized as risky by other European countries.Stephen Evans of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the study's suggestion that a single dose protected people for 12 weeks was \"useful but not definitive.\"He said that the authors themselves acknowledged their research was not designed to investigate the vaccine's dosing schedule and that their conclusions were based on statistical modeling, not actual patients tracked over time.\"It certainly isn't very strong evidence, but there is also no indication this is the wrong thing to do,\" Evans said of Britain's strategy.One of the Oxford researchers, Dr. Andrew Pollard, said scientists also believe the AstraZeneca vaccine will continue to offer protection against new variants of Covid-19, though they are still waiting for data on that. Fast-spreading mutant versions have caused alarm around the world.\"If we do need to update the vaccines, then it is actually a relatively straightforward process. It only takes a matter of months, rather than the huge efforts that everyone went through last year to get the very large-scale trials run,\" Pollard told the BBC.Meanwhile, a UN-backed program to supply Covid-19 vaccines to the neediest people worldwide is gearing up after a troubled start. The Covax Facility announced plans Wednesday for an initial distribution of some 100 million doses by the end of March and more than 200 million more by the end of June to dozens of countries.Nearly all of the doses expected for the first phase are due to come from AstraZeneca and its partner, the Serum Institute of India. The rollout will be contingent on the World Health Organization authorizing the AstraZeneca shot for emergency use, which is expected to happen this month.Some 190 countries and territories are participating in Covax, which has seen rich nations scoop up vaccine supplies, sometimes at premium prices.The pandemic's worldwide death toll has eclipsed 2.2 million, including about 447,000 in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University data.New cases per day in the US and the number of Americans in the hospital with Covid-19 have dropped sharply in the past few weeks, but deaths are still running at close to all-time highs at an average of around 3,100 a day. Deaths often lag behind the infection curve, because it can take weeks to sicken and die from Covid-19.As the Super Bowl approaches, Fauci is warning people against inviting others over for Super Bowl parties, urging viewers to \"just lay low and cool it\" to avoid turning Sunday's big game into a super spreader event.\"You don't want parties with people that you haven't had much contact with,\" he told NBC's \"Today\" show. \"You just don't know if they're infected.\" (AP)\n"

      "BEIJING -- A Chinese drugmaker said Wednesday, December 30, its coronavirus vaccine was found to be 79.3 percent effective at preventing infection in preliminary data from the final round of testing, moving Beijing closer to possibly being able to fulfill its pledge to supply other developing countries.Sinopharm's data release is the first official announcement of late-stage trial data from a Chinese company on its vaccine candidates. Its effectiveness rate is behind Moderna's vaccine, which is more than 94 percent effective, and Pfizer's, which is 95 percent effective. Scientists had cautioned that Covid-19 vaccines may only be about as effective as the flu vaccine, which generally is about 50 percent effective.\n",
      "However, the company did not provide additional information, and final proof of the vaccine's effectiveness will depend on publication of fuller scientific data.“That’s useful and at least it is showing that it is probably effective,” said Jin Dong-yan, a medical professor at the University of Hong Kong. “However, it would be helpful if they could also release some more information, including the sample size. How many have been vaccinated and how many are in the control group? They should release more information.”State-owned Sinopharm is one of at least five Chinese developers that are part of a global race to create vaccines for the disease that has killed more than 1.7 million people. More than one million health care workers and others in China have received vaccine candidates from either Sinopharm or another company, Sinovac, under emergency approval while testing was underway.\n",
      "Also Wednesday, Sinovac Biotech Ltd. signed an agreement to build a production facility in Beijing for a coronavirus vaccine with a planned annual capacity of one billion doses, the newspaper Beijing Youth News reported.Sinopharm, or China National Pharmaceutical Group, has applied for approval of its vaccine following the third and final stage of testing, a unit of the company, Beijing Biological Products Institute Ltd., said on its website.It would be the second vaccine from a Sinopharm unit, following a separate candidate developed by the company's Wuhan Institute of Biological Products Ltd.The Beijing Institute's vaccine has been approved by regulatory authorities in the United Arab Emirates. Authorities in the UAE previously said the vaccine was 86 percent effective.The Sinopharm vaccine relies on two doses, the company said, similar to Western-developed vaccines. The two-sentence announcement gave no information about side effects, conditions required to transport and use the vaccine, or other details.Western-developed vaccines must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit). Chinese developers have said theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F).\n",
      "While the vaccines are not yet available to the general population, China is in the middle of a huge push to distribute them to 50 million people in an emergency use program before the Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions travel to be reunited with their families.A former Shanghai CDC immunologist and medical professional, Tao Lina, said he received the first dose of Beijing Institute's vaccine on Saturday under the emergency use program.He had \"absolutely no adverse reactions, not even a localized reaction,\" he said.Chinese producers have at least six possible vaccines in the final stage of clinical trials. They are testing vaccines in more than a dozen countries, including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Few details have been released, leaving experts abroad wondering about effectiveness and side effects.Western companies are distributing newly approved coronavirus vaccines, but some health experts express concern that too little will be available to poorer countries. China's government says it will ensure Chinese-developed vaccines are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing distribution deals abroad.Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process in the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for Chinese vaccines to be used there.

      "However, Rama said he does not need the title, saying he would be content to just be called the “convenor,” with Casas as his vice chairman.Casas is a member of Cebu City’s vaccine board, which is headed by City Health Department head Dr. Jeffrey Ibones.Rama said he “will just take” his appointment by Labella as a “full support for the convenor,” adding he does “not want to be called as vaccine czar.”\n",
      "Rama’s challengeLabella’s move came after Rama urged the mayor during a press conference on Sunday, Feb. 7 to divulge his real health condition.Despite their public exchanges, Labella and Rama said they remain friends.Rama also said in the Feb. 7 presser that Labella needs to be on top of the situation, especially with the recent spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city.The city, says Rama, needs to have “a visible and active leader” who will lead the fight against the pandemic.Rama called for a press conference after Labella urged him to “put aside politics.”Rama, during the regular City Council session last Friday, Feb. 5, criticized Labella for not being present at City Hall despite the increasing new cases of Covid-19.Labella has been working from home since Jan. 25, 2021 after he was discharged from the hospital for an ear infection.Although he is working from home, Labella said he has been coordinating with the proper agencies for the implementation of necessary measures in response to the current Covid-19 situation.

      "WASHINGTON -- The US added a second Covid-19 vaccine to its arsenal Friday, boosting efforts to beat back an outbreak so dire that the nation is regularly recording more than 3,000 deaths a day.Much-needed doses are set to arrive Monday after the Food and Drug Administration authorized an emergency rollout of the vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. and the National Institutes of Health.\n",
      "The move marks the world's first authorization for Moderna's shots. The vaccine is very similar to one from Pfizer Inc. and Germany's BioNTech that's now being dispensed to millions of health care workers and nursing home residents as the biggest vaccination drive in US history starts to ramp up.The two work \"better than we almost dared to hope,\" NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins told The Associated Press. \"Science is working here, science has done something amazing.\"Early results of large, still unfinished studies show both vaccines appear safe and strongly protective although Moderna's is easier to handle since it doesn't need to be stored at ultra-frozen temperatures.\n",
      "A second vaccine represents a ray of hope amid despair as the virus continues to spread unabated even before holiday gatherings that are certain to further fuel the outbreak.The scourge has claimed more than 312,000 US lives and killed 1.7 million people worldwide. New cases in the US are running at over 216,000 per day on average. Deaths per day have hit all-time highs, eclipsing 3,600 on Wednesday.California has emerged as one of the most lethal hot spots, with hospitals running out of intensive care beds and ambulances lining up outside emergency rooms in scenes reminiscent of the calamity around New York City last spring. California on Friday reported over 41,000 new cases and 300 more deaths.When New York's hospitals were in crisis, health care workers from across the country came to help out. This time, \"there's no cavalry coming\" because so many hospitals are swamped, said Dr. Marc Futernick, an emergency room physician in Los Angeles.The nation is scrambling to expand vaccinations as rapidly as Moderna and Pfizer can churn out doses. Moderna's is for people 18 and older, Pfizer's starts at age 16.It's just the beginning of \"what we hope will be a big push to get this terrible virus behind us, although it will take many more months to get to all Americans,\" Collins said.\n",
      "Moderna expects to have between 100 million and 125 million doses available globally in the first three months of 2021, with 85-100 million of those available in the US.Even with additional candidates in the pipeline, there won't be enough for the general population until spring, and shots will be rationed in the meantime. And while health workers are enthusiastically embracing vaccination, authorities worry the public may need more reassurance to ensure more people get in line when it's their turn.\"Frankly if we don't succeed in getting 80% or so of Americans immunized against Covid-19 by the middle of this 2021 year, we have the risk that this epidemic could go on and on and on,\" Collins said.He is especially concerned that accurate information about the shots' value reaches communities of color, which have been hard-hit by Covid-19 yet also are wary after years of health care disparities and research abuses.To try to help instill confidence, Vice President Mike Pence received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on live TV Friday, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams.FDA's decision could help pave the way for other countries that are considering the Moderna vaccine, the first-ever regulatory clearance for the small Cambridge, Massachusetts, company. European regulators could authorize its use as soon as January 6. Britain, Canada and a few other countries already have cleared the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, with a European Union decision due Monday.\"What we want to always remember is one size does not fit all. We want to have options,\" said Dr. Paul Duprex of the University of Pittsburgh.Moderna has about 5.9 million doses ready for shipment set to begin over the weekend, according to Operation Warp Speed, the government's vaccine development program. Injections of health workers and nursing home residents continue next week, before other essential workers and vulnerable groups are allowed to get in line.Both Moderna's and Pfizer-BioNTech's shots are so-called mRNA vaccines, made with a groundbreaking new technology. They don't contain any coronavirus - meaning they cannot cause infection. Instead, they use a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spike protein on the surface of the virus, ready to attack if the real thing comes along.Their development less than a year after the coronavirus first emerged set a speed record, but Collins stressed that shouldn't worry people. The speed was due to billions in company and government investments paired with years of earlier scientific research, not any cut corners.\"The rigor of the analysis of these vaccines is unprecedented,\" Collins said. \"We're not done with this but hope is on the way, and the hope comes from this scientific brain trust that has pulled out all the stops.\"Experts are hoping the two vaccines together will \"break the back of the pandemic\" when combined with masks and other precautions, said Dr. Arnold Monto of the University of Michigan, who chaired an advisory committee that publicly debated the shots' evidence ahead of FDA's decisions.

      "AT A GLANCE, from what Friday's Capitol meeting and news sources told us:[1] Local governments may buy vaccines of their choice but the national government must be a party to the sale, per policy accord among the world's vaccine manufacturers.\n",
      "[2] While Cebu City and Mandaue City have appropriated money for their own vaccines, not one Cebu LGU has yet negotiated with and signed a deal with any supplier.[3] No person, including health workers and other frontliners, can be forced to be inoculated. But details on that, along with the person's waiver of liability by the LGU for adverse effects of the vaccine, are not yet available. Other requirements may include the certification of one's doctor on fitness to be inoculated.[4] Cebu, with the National Capital Region and Davao, will be given priority as management strategy for key cities in the rollout of the first shipment of vaccines.\n",
      "CEBU CITY, CAPITOL POSITION. Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia -- in the January 15 meeting at the Capitol with mayors of towns and component cities -- restated the position she laid down last December 17, 2020: she will wait for guidelines from the national government.The national government's policy at the start: through President Rodrigo Duterte and the Inter-Agency Task For Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID), the central authority will choose and buy the vaccines. Any local government unit (LGU) that wishes to buy its own, on top of what the central government procures, shall enter into a three-party agreement with the vaccine supplier.In sum: Wait for Manila's diktat.Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella said last December and restated this week that he'd wait for the guidelines, trusting the assurance of vaccine czar Carlito Galves Jr. of IATF that Cebu would be given priority. Labella has been waiting since then even as he created a panel to choose the vaccine and prepare the groundwork for its use. Earlier, last December 23, the City Council included in the city's 2021 budget P400 million for the vaccine, with the plan to add P100 million in a supplemental budget.Governor Gwen stuck to her position of not tackling the matter of vaccine yet. Friday, January 15, she said she would not announce how much Capitol would spend for the vaccine, focusing instead on Capitol programs to help small businesses and the economy recover.'IMPATIENT LGUs' DID NOT WAIT. Other LGUs however chose not to just watch and wait. More than 30 in the list released Wednesday, January 13, had started scouting for and negotiating with vaccine suppliers as early as last year. \"Most of them\" were reported to have \"inked the deal\" already, making the other local governments in the country look like they had some catching up to do.IATF apparently has been taking its time to issue guidelines on procurement by LGUs. Malacañang and vaccine czar Galvez responded only amid the swelling sentiment among the LGUs that chose to be active in procuring their vaccine, topped by the startling disclosure that the president's adviser on entrepreneurship, Joy Concepcion, led a private group to secure the first shipment of 2.5 million vaccine doses to this country. (The private organizations that put up the money included Cebu's Aboitiz Foundation).Last December 26, Manila announced that a local government may buy its vaccine of choice, provided the government is the third party, conforming to the policy set by the vaccine suppliers.President Duterte, acknowledging the success of some LGUs in clinching their own deals, said, \"Many local governments opted to buy on their own because they have the money and they can choose the vaccine they want.\"The vaccines an LGU purchases, DILG and DOH made clear, shall be for those persons who are not included in the national government's priority list.PRO-ACTIVE LGUs, SOUND BITES. Senator Francis Tolentino, chairman of the Senate committee on local government, lauded the President this week for ratifying the initiative of some LGUs in procuring vaccines.He defended the legal right of LGUs to make the emergency purchase, citing the Local Government Code and the procurement reform law and asserting that no current law or the president's Executive Order to the Food & Drug Authority on EUA (emergency use authority) prohibits LGUs from buying vaccines on their own. The requirement about the tripartite agreement is imposed by the vaccine makers; Manila is just conforming to it.Senator Tolentino called the zealous LGUs \"pro-active.\" Governor Gwen said the activism would draw sound bites and headlines but she would rather concentrate on the more pressing problem of nursing the province's economy back to health. Getting the vaccine is largely the national government's job. Besides, she said, they wouldn't know how many doses Capitol needs to buy until they are told its share from the Manila allotment. As to controlling Covid-19 transmission, the governor would stick to the health protocols and boosting immunity, including \"traditional\" methods.WHO DID BETTER. One can't tell for now which LGUs took the better option. But the outcome of the race for the vaccines, whether a local government joins it or just watches and waits, won't be determined until the next few months.Developments on the coronavirus -- its containment or further spread and how access to vaccines makes the difference -- may tell which public officials took the better path in coping with the pandemic.\n",

      "CHALLENGING a person to be vaccinated first is an inaccurate measure to determine the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte said in response to questions if she is willing to be vaccinated first once it is available.Duterte-Carpio said this on Friday, December 11, 2020, when asked by the media during her radio interview via 87.5 FM Davao City Disaster Radio.\n",
      "While the mayor did not directly answer it, she said the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine can be determined after it undergoes a clinical trial and gets approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health (DOH).\"These are things na mao atoang gina-measure (we are measuring) because allowed siya sa government.

      "The mayor's statement comes as different pharmaceutical companies are making progress in the development of Covid-19 vaccines.Duterte-Carpio recently said the City Government has been reaching out to vaccine-makers in a bid to gain access to it once it gets approval from the national government.In recent SunStar reports, the mayor's father, President Rodrigo Duterte, and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III are willing to go first in line for a Covid-19 vaccine once it is approved for domestic use to convince more Filipinos to get immunized.As of Friday, no vaccine had yet been approved by DOH and FDA.\n",

      "TO ENSURE early access of cities to the Covid-19 vaccines, League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) national president Mayor Evelio “Bing” Leonardia created on December 23 the LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment.“We need to strategize our efforts to ensure that our constituents have early access to quality and affordable vaccines, but we need to gather as much information as possible to guide our decisions,” Leonardia said.\n",
      "The primary function of the Committee is to coordinate with the Covid-19 National Inter-Agency Task Force (NIATF) for the Management of Emerging and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Budget and Management, and other concerned agencies to determine and recommend the most appropriate courses of action to facilitate the availment of the Covid-19 vaccines for cities.Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas, a former LCP president, was appointed by Leonardia as chairperson of the Committee.The other Committee members are national vice chairman and General Santos City Mayor Ronnel Rivera; vice president for Luzon and Balanga City Mayor Francis Anthony Garcia, Region 9 representative and Zamboanga City Mayor Beng Climaco, focal mayor for Health and Candon City Mayor Ericson Singson.\n",
      "The Committtee is expected to submit their recommendations to Leonardia on or before January 8.“Proper coordination with concerned agencies is a must. This is, after all, a top priority for all of us,” Leonardia stressed.Aside from coordinating with concerned government agencies and key officials, the LCP Committee is also tasked to conduct “exploratory talks” with qualified pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Aztra Zeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline in the first week of January and carry out a collective and advantageous vaccine availment by the cities.Leonardia believes that while the national government is committed to providing vaccines nationwide, it is in the best interest of the cities that they are ready to supplement, augment, and complete the national vaccination program. He added that this is all a matter of teamwork to ensure our people’s health and safety.Meanwhile, the LCP, recognizing the urgency of vaccine availment, has also scheduled a dialog with Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez on January 12 where city mayors nationwide are expected to participate.

      "Galvez had earlier met with Leonardia and the LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment on December 29 to discuss the timeline of vaccine availability based on ongoing negotiations with prospective pharmaceutical companies.“During our talks with the Secretary Galvez, he explained what vaccines will be available and the specifications of each type. Since securing vaccines is a top priority concern of all city mayors, we find it necessary that we hold this LCP general assembly for them to get first-hand information and participate in the formation of policies and procedures of the vaccine availment process,” Leonardia said.FDA Director-General Rolando Enrique Domingo is also expected to attend the meeting to provide updates on the emergency use authorization for Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment, led by Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas, is set to push for the adoption of a resolution requesting for the LCP’s membership in the IATF-EID to ensure proper alignment of national and local vaccination efforts.The assembly comes at the heels after several city mayors had already allocated budgets for vaccines. Leonardia, who is the mayor of Bacolod City, had also allocated P300 million for his constituents’ vaccine needs. (PR)\n",

      "Lapu-Lapu City Mayor Junard Chan, on Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021, said they will prioritize in the inoculation the frontliners, vendors and drivers.The mayor’s office will propose a supplemental budget to the City Council for the vaccine purchase. The funds will be released only after the council’s approval.Grace Mary Carungay, city epidemiological and surveillance unit officer, said the plan to purchase vaccines will bring good to Oponganons.\n",
      "In Consolacion, Mayor Joannes Alegado said Thursday the P20 million budget will be for 10,000 individuals who belong to the vulnerable sector—older adults and frontliners.The town has around 7,000 individuals who are 60 years old and above. They will be prioritized along with frontliners, Alegado said.The town mayor said they would set aside another budget if the Food and Drug Administration would approve a vaccine that is inexpensive.As of Wednesday, Jan. 6, Lapu-Lapu City had a total case count of 2,677, of which 52 were active cases, 2,514 were recoveries and 111 deaths. Consolacion had a total case count of 649, of which seven were active cases, 604 were recoveries and 38 deaths.Both Lapu-Lapu City and Consolacion are waiting for the Department of Health to issue guidelines on the purchase of the vaccines.Of the 44 municipalities and six component cities under the Cebu Provincial Government, only Consolacion and Talisay City have set aside funds for the inoculation of their residents against Covid-19.“Hopefully, the Department of Health will choose the right vaccine. I hope that will push through because other nations have started their vaccination,” Alegado said. (NDT, ANV / KAL)\n",

      "AS THE mass Covid-19 vaccination approaches, officials of the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) admitted that some of their workers are having reservations about getting the Covid-19 vaccine due to various reasons.SPMC officer-in-charge Dr. Ricardo Audan said in a press conference right after the Covid-19 vaccination simulation exercise on Wednesday, February 10, 2021, that only 62 percent or an estimated 3,200 out of the 5,000 SPMC workers, both medical and non-medical frontliners, have signed up for the pre-vaccination registration.\n",
      "He added that these numbers might even decrease during the vaccination day, although he assumes that these workers were willing to \"volunteer\" to get vaccinated as they gave their consent in the registration conducted online.\"However, on that day, baka mag-change siya kaya may (that figure would change that’s why we conducted) registration, counseling and screening for that,\" Audan said.SPMC Vaccination Committee Chairperson Dr. Pamela Ferrer said not all those who registered will be qualified to be vaccinated on that day.Ferrer said they will be conducting a pre-vaccination screening to determine if the employee is fit to get the vaccine. Among the considerations is the physical and emotional aspect of those who will get the vaccine.\"On the day of vaccination, didtoa pa nato mahibaw-an kasi [through] screening if eligible sila (we would then know, through screening, who will be eligible) for the vaccination on the day. Kasi baka may sakit sila,” she said.She also assumed that those who registered are willing to get the vaccine.\"We assume that if you register for the master list, you are willing to be vaccinated because part of the registration is naa kay (that you will be giving) final consent for the vaccination on the day of the vaccine. It's already a willingness yung (coming from) 3,200 plus employees,\" Ferrer said.Among the factors Audan cited is the \"Dengvaxia scare,\" which affected some of the workers’ trust and confidence towards the vaccine. The Dengvaxia of Sanofi Pasteur became an issue in 2017 after some recipients of the vaccine, mostly children, had allegedly suffered adverse effects.Audan admitted they cannot compel their employees to get vaccinated, but he emphasized that their willingness is important.\"Of course we cannot force them. We are always informing them that this is not mandatory because right nila (that is their right). But we are encouraging them to have the vaccination,\" the SPMC chief said.SPMC workers will be the pilot beneficiaries of the initial rollout of vaccines coming from the national government.During the press conference, Department of Health-Davao Region (DOH-Davao) revealed that they still do not know what Covid-19 vaccine Davao City will be receiving and that they are still awaiting the national government's confirmation.She said based on information they received, vaccines are set to arrive in the country on February 12, which will most likely arrive in the city on the same day.Audan said they still have to conduct a separate simulation exercise for the vaccination rollout in the hospital.Ferrer said they will conduct the vaccination in batches to avoid overcrowding and to ensure that operations of the hospital won't be affected.In a previous SunStar Davao report, Davao Medical Society (DMS) president Dr. Jose Beltran Jr. said some medical practitioners are having reservations about getting the Covid-19 vaccine due to various reasons.He said this was the sentiment of some of their members who are from different medical fields and specializations.Some of its members said they do not want to be inoculated with Covid-19 vaccines coming from China, India and Russia.\"Kung dili kuno gikan sa US (United States) or Europe, dili sila magpaturok (If the vaccines will not be coming from the US or Europe, they won't be vaccinated),\" Beltran said.He explained that they are critical about the efficacy rate of the vaccines coming from these countries.\n"

      "DIVERSIFIED conglomerate Ayala Corporation has committed to procure 450,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).At $5.50 per dose, including the expenses for logistics, Ayala Corporation president and COO Fernando Zobel de Ayala said the entire transaction would cost P120 million.\n",
      "Zobel said half of these vaccines would be donated to the government as requested, while the other half would go to the private sector.“This is a time for everyone - private sector, public sector - to work together. Never have we faced a crisis of these proportions that has produced so much suffering in our country,” Zobel said during the virtual press briefing by Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Monday, January 4, 2021.“I’d like to think that the private sector has come through in a very big way, with a call from the government, and tried to to do everything that they could, not only for their employees, their suppliers, but the public in general. I think we’re all here to help the country as a whole in the best way that we can,” he added.\n",
      "As of end-2020, Zobel said Ayala’s Covid-19 response has reached P12.7 billion.Zobel said the company will also help in the distribution of the vaccines.The Ayala Group, one of the biggest conglomerates in the country, is among the companies that signed the first vaccine deal in the country.On November 27, 2020, the business community signed a tripartite agreement with the government and AstraZeneca for the procurement of 2.6 million doses.The vaccines are expected to be delivered in May or June 2021. AstraZeneca has sought to conduct clinical trials for its vaccine candidate in the Philippines.AstraZeneca earlier reported that the vaccine AZD1222, which it developed together with the University of Oxford, showed an efficacy of 90 percent when given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart.Efficacy was 62 percent when given as two full doses at least one month apart.The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 percent, the company added.

      "(UPDATED) The business community and local government units (LGUs) on Thursday, January 14, 2021, signed agreements to procure additional doses of the AstraZeneca candidate vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).The transaction brought the total volume of vaccines purchased by the private sector and LGUs from AstraZeneca to 17 million (not 20 million) doses, including the first vaccine deal of 2.6 million doses in November 2020.\n",
      "The National Task Force Against Covid-19 said the second advance market commitment with AstraZeneca involved 14.4 million doses.As of Thursday, the total volume of Covid-19 vaccines procured by the private sector, national government and LGUs have exceeded 70 million doses.The government earlier secured 30 million doses of Novavax vaccines from the Serum Institute of India (SII) and 25 million doses of the CoronaVac from Sinovac Biotech of China.\n",
      "An unspecified volume of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine may also be delivered in February through the Covax initiative of the World Health Organization (WHO).Lotis Ramin, AstraZeneca Philippines country director, said the company maintains its “commitment to ensure broad and equitable access to the vaccine at no profit” for the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic.Officials earlier said the AstraZeneca vaccine costs $5.5, including logistics expenses. It is the cheapest among the candidate vaccines in the market.“Today, we are delighted to conclude 17 million doses, which can reach millions of Filipinos through the close collaboration between AstraZeneca, the Philippine government, local government units and private sector donors,” Ramin said during the signing ceremony dubbed “A Dose of Hope” Thursday.“We are working closely with regulatory authorities to ensure that the Covid-19 vaccine lives up to the highest safety standards,” she added.AstraZeneca has applied for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that will allow the use of its vaccine in the Philippines for the duration of the public health emergency.\n",
      "As of Thursday, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Enrique Domingo said the Vaccine Expert Panel was awaiting the pharmaceutical company’s response to questions seeking to clarify some clinical trial data.AstraZeneca already has an EUA in the UK, Argentina and India. The company has also reached a deal with SII of India for the manufacture of its vaccine.Among the LGUs represented during the signing ceremony on Thursday are the cities of Caloocan, Makati, Mandaluyong, Manila, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon, San Juan, Valenzuela and Las Piñas in the National Capital Region.AstraZeneca is expected to make its first shipments to the Philippines in the third quarter of 2021, said vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.The Novavax vaccine is also expected to arrive in July.For the first half of the year, government is expecting shipments of the Sinovac vaccines - 50,000 doses on February 20, 950,000 doses in March, and two to three million doses a month until December.Each vaccine is administered in two doses, both of which must be of the same brand.Sinovac filed an application for an EUA in the Philippines on January 13.The FDA has issued an EUA only for Pfizer-BioNTech. (Marites Villamor-Ilano / SunStar Philippines)Note: This article has been updated to reflect the NTF statement that the second agreement with AstraZeneca involves only 14.4 million doses, not 17 million.

      "THE rapid expansion of Covid-19 vaccinations to senior citizens across the U.S. has led to bottlenecks, system crashes and hard feelings in many states because of overwhelming demand for the shots.Mississippi's Health Department stopped taking new appointments the same day it began accepting them because of a “monumental surge” in requests. People had to wait hours to book vaccinations through a state website or a toll-free number Tuesday and Wednesday, and many were booted off the site because of technical problems and had to start over.\n",
      "In California, counties begged for more coronavirus vaccine to reach millions of their senior citizens. Hospitals in South Carolina ran out of appointment slots within hours. Phone lines were jammed in Georgia.“It’s chaos,” said New York City resident Joan Jeffri, 76, who had to deal with broken hospital web links and unanswered phone calls before her daughter helped her secure an appointment. “If they want to vaccinate 80% of the population, good luck, if this is the system. We’ll be here in five years.”Up until the past few days, health care workers and nursing home patients had been given priority in most places around the U.S. But amid frustration over the slow rollout, states have thrown open the line to many of the nation's 54 million senior citizens with the blessing of President Donald Trump's administration, though the minimum age varies from place to place, at 65, 70 or higher.\n",
      "On Thursday, New Jersey expanded vaccinations to people between 16 and 65 with certain medical conditions — including up to 2 million smokers, who are more prone to health complications.The U.S., meanwhile, recorded 3,848 deaths on Wednesday, down from an all-time high of 4,327 the day before, according to Johns Hopkins University. The nation’s overall death toll from Covid-19 has topped 385,000.President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion coronavirus plan Thursday that includes speeding up vaccinations. Called the “American Rescue Plan,” the legislative proposal would meet Biden’s goal of administering 100 million vaccines by the 100th day of his administration.More than 11.1 million Americans, or over 3% of the U.S. population, have gotten their first shot of the vaccine, a gain of about 800,000 from the day before, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. The goal of inoculating anywhere between 70% and 85% of the population to achieve herd immunity and conquer the outbreak is still many months away.Hard-hit Los Angeles County, the nation’s most populous county with 10 million residents, said it couldn’t immediately provide shots to the elderly because it had inoculated only about a quarter of its 800,000 health care workers.“We’re not done with our health care workers, and we actually don’t have enough vaccine right now to be able to get done more quickly,” Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said. “We haven’t heard back from the state about vaccine availability and how it would be distributed.”\n",
      "Santa Clara County health officials said the county of 2 million people had only enough vaccine to inoculate people 75 and older, not the 65-and-older crowd.“It’s almost like a beauty contest. And this should not be a beauty contest,” County Supervisor Cindy Chavez said. “This is about life and death.”In Mississippi, officials said new appointments will probably have to wait until a hoped-for shipment of vaccine in mid-February.In South Carolina, Kershaw Health in Camden implored people not to call its hospitals or doctors to schedule vaccination appointments after receiving more than 1,000 requests in two days. State health authorities said their hot line got 5,000 calls on Wednesday.Francis Clark said she tried repeatedly to schedule an appointment for her 81-year-old mother, who lives alone outside Florence, South Carolina, and doesn’t have internet access. But the local hospital had no openings on Wednesday, Clark said, and the other vaccination sites are too far away.“My mom can’t drive to Charleston,” Clark said. “She’s too old.”Allison Salerno, an audio producer from Athens, Georgia, said she spent the better part of a day calling her state’s health department to get a vaccine appointment for her 89-year-old mother.“I started calling at 8:30 a.m. and on the 67th call I was finally put on hold,” Salerno said. “I had already pre-registered her two weeks before online, but I never received a confirmation.\"After Salerno had spent 65 minutes on hold, someone finally came on the line and gave her mother a Saturday appointment.“My mother has not been out since the beginning of the pandemic,” Salerno said. “She’s a very healthy woman and she wants to go to the grocery store, she wants to get her hair done.”Meanwhile, some states, like Minnesota, are waiting before throwing open the doors.“As we learn more, we will work to make sure everyone who is eligible for a vaccine knows how, where, and when they can get their shots,” the state Health Department said in an email. “Everyone’s opportunity to get vaccinated will come; it will just take some time.”Arizona, which had the nation’s highest Covid-19 diagnosis rate over the past week, will start signing up people 65 and older next week. It also plans to open a vaccination site at Phoenix Municipal Stadium in addition to the one dispensing thousands of shots daily at the home of the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals.To step up the pace of vaccinations, South Carolina made a rule change allowing medical students, retired nurses and other certain professionals to administer the shots.California lawmakers are increasing the pressure on Gov. Gavin Newsom to likewise expand authorization for who can give injections to include nursing students, retired medical workers, firefighters and National Guard members with medical training.Newsom said the state’s priority is to deliver vaccines “as quickly as possible to those who face the gravest consequences.” He urged patience for those not yet eligible, saying: “Your turn is coming.”Jeffri, the New Yorker, spent several days trying to book a vaccination and once actually received a slot, only to get a follow-up text saying they didn't have the doses. Finally, with some online sleuthing from her daughter, the retired arts-administration professor got an appointment for her first shot — two weeks from now.“It’s a relief,\" said Jeffri, who wrote to Gov. Andrew Cuomo about her ordeal. \"But I’m not sure I trust it until it’s done.” (AP)\n"

      "Diaz said vaccine czar Carlito Galvez has already informed the governors about the arrival of about 3.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines in March.They were also informed of the arrival of 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines, but Diaz confirmed that they do not expect that the province will be included among the areas that will be given the allocation because of the difficulty in the storage requirements of Pfizer and that Metro areas like Manila, Cebu and Davao were already mentioned to be getting the allocation of the Pfizer vaccines.Diaz also said that they are banking on the help of former Third District representative and provincial consultant Alfredo Benitez and the Negros congressmen to secure the 70 percent target of the province for vaccination.\n",
      "The province is asking the National Government for an allocation of three million doses for 1.5 million targeted population for the mass vaccination. This is aside from the 100,000 doses that will be purchased by the province also from AstraZeneca.Medical frontliners will be given priority for vaccination and senior citizens with comorbidities based on the DOH guidelines, Diaz said.He also said that they are happy with the preparations of the DOH for the mass vaccination because the agency will take care of the vaccines, including all the consumables like cottons, alcohols and the vials and that the local government units (LGUs) will only collect the used vials and return them to the DOH for responsible disposal.Diaz said the Provincial Health Office will submit to his office Wednesday, February 10, the detailed list from LGUs under their system the list of registered individuals for vaccination.\n",

      "NOBODY is left behind. This is equity in plain terms.Upholding the principle of equity is a challenge for society, more so equity in immunization, particularly to inoculate people against infection of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\n",
      "Yet, vaccine equity should remain a priority for governments, particularly the Philippines where deep social disparities create in the population large swathes of vulnerable citizens.Reducing the vaccine inequity begins by identifying and addressing its root causes, advocates the World Health Organization.Equity should be prioritized along with efficiency in the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines in the country.\n",
      "The Philippines has a total population of approximately 108 million, 70 million of whom are targeted for vaccination by the government.This is according to Department of Health (DOH) 7 Director Jaime Bernadas, as reported on Jan. 20, 2021 by Wenilyn B. Sabalo and Philip A. Cerojano in “SunStar Cebu.”Bernadas said the government aims to vaccinate 35.1 million Filipinos in 2021. The prioritized include “senior citizens, indigents, frontliners, and government employees.”The rest of the 70 million will be vaccinated by the government in 2022. By 2023, all Filipinos should be inoculated, said Bernadas.To prepare for the rollout, the DOH 7 began briefing its personnel and employees of local government units (LGUs), with the LGUs expected to “cascade” the information to the communities.Bernadas said the DOH has scheduled briefings with private medical practitioners next week. This leveling-off of information about the vaccines among the stakeholders is expected to avoid spreading contradicting, conflicting information, he said.\n",
      "The DOH’s preference for a “trickle-down” program of information, education and communication (IEC) is centralized, time-consuming and not guaranteed against misinformation and misperception, particularly in untangling the deep-set biases of many Filipinos against free government vaccines, following the Dengvaxia controversy in November 2017.Fears and suspicions stirred up by conflicting health claims in media lingered and turned many parents against the government’s immunization campaigns even a year later, with only about 50 to 60 percent of Filipino children covered in vaccination programs compared to pre-Dengvaxia coverage of 90 percent, said DOH Undersecretary Enrique Domingo in September 2018, according to a Rappler report on Sept. 27, 2018.Getting the trust back of the people in a vaccine, primarily its safety and efficacy, is crucial for vaccination to take place.Regaining public trust will hardly result from a centralized IEC strategy, as gauged from low immunization rates following the 2018 DOH “Ligtas Tigdas” supplemental immunization activities and the school- and community-based immunization programs following the Dengvaxia scare.Parents refused to give their consent for their children to participate in school immunizations. When health workers went house-to-house for vaccination, mothers hid their children. In Metro Manila, health workers spent as long as 30 minutes to try to convince parents to let their children be vaccinated, said DOH National Immunization Program Manager Maria Silva to Rappler in 2018.The DOH, LGUs, and other public and private stakeholders should refocus their IEC campaigns on the Covid-19 vaccines in the communities, tapping influencers and the trimedia and social media, if applicable.Citizens have questions about the safety and the efficacy of the vaccines, given the varying manufacturers and storage requirements.For raising public confidence in the Covid-19 vaccines, particularly against the new strains, the public participation of key public figures, such as President Rodrigo Duterte, may counter citizens’ anxieties and contribute to achieving the vaccine equity that will be the key out of this pandemic.\n",

A second dose should not be given to anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis following administration of the first dose of this vaccine,” MHRA chief executive June Raine said in a statement.Raine said the two individuals who developed severe allergies were promptly treated and recovering well.Allergic reactions are among the known side effects with any vaccine, but Raine said these are very rare and the benefits of being immunized still outweigh the risks.\n",
      "“Most people will not get anaphylaxis and the benefits in protecting people against Covid-19 outweigh the risks,” Raine said.She advised those who are scheduled to be inoculated to proceed with their appointment.“You can be completely confident that this vaccine has met the MHRA’s robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. The safety data has also been critically assessed by the government’s independent advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines,” Raine said.“No vaccine would be approved unless it meets these stringent standards – on that you can be sure,” she added.She said they have convened an Expert Group of the Commission on Human Medicines’ (CHM) to review the reports on anaphylaxis and consider any possible mitigation on the risk of anaphylaxis.Raine also assured that a safety monitoring strategy has been put in place to allow rapid, real-time safety monitoring at population level.\n",
      "The strategy works as indicated by the immediate reports on allergic reactions, she said.Vaccine recipients are monitored for 15 minutes after inoculation, with a longer observation period when indicated after clinical assessment. (Marites Villamor-Ilano / SunStar Philippines)\n"

      "CEBU Archbishop Jose Palma said he is ready to have himself vaccinated.Palma, during the launching of the Archdiocese’s official website and the website and social media platforms for the 500 Years of Christianity (500 YoC) celebration on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2021, said they have defined their priority in case the Covid-19 vaccine becomes available.\n",
      "“We, bishops, should be vaccinated in front of the TV, so that people will know. The question is, asa man (which part of the body)? Sa bukton (in the arm)? Tiyan o sa tiil (stomach or feet)? Anyway, we are that ready,” he said during the press conference.Palma said the people should be open to vaccination.The prelate said that while waiting for the vaccine, they still monitor the cases regularly and they are hopeful that in “God’s time, wonderful surprises” will come in the middle of the year that would make it possible for the incoming celebrations to accommodate physical participation of the faithful.\n",
      "ActivitiesBefore the official launching of the year-long 500 YoC celebration on April 4 (Easter Sunday), Fr. Mhar Balili, who chairs the committee assigned for the celebration, divulged to the public the latest significant updates and lineup of activities for April.Balili said simultaneous masses all throughout the parishes under the Archdiocese of Cebu will be held at 4 p.m. on April 4.Afterwards, there will be an unveiling and blessing of the Jubilee cross in front of the grounds of the different parishes in Cebu and the reading of Palma’s circular declaring the opening of the year-long 500 YoC.Balili said the Jubilee cross that will be mounted is about two meters long and weighs 150 kilos.There will be a reenactment of the first baptism in front of the Magellan’s Cross at 10 a.m. on April 14. This will be followed by a 4 p.m. mass to be officiated by the new Papal Nuncio to the Philippines Most. Rev Charles Brown, renewal of baptismal promises for those who will attend the mass in the same venue and the baptism of 10 children who are recipients of the apostolate of the first five major religious congregations that first arrived in Cebu centuries ago.\n",

Niño Basilica Templete at 7:30 p.m.Balili said these activities were submitted to the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, and they are in constant coordination with the local government officials regarding the 500 YoC celebration.“Mag-ampo ta nga moubos ang Covid dinhi sa Cebu para mapadayon ang atong mga plano (We should pray that the Covid-19 cases in Cebu will drop so our plans will push through). But if worse comes to worst nga moingon ang IATF nga wala’y paapilon or wala’y face-to-face nga misa, virtual lang tanan (the IATF decides no one can attend or cancels face-to-face masses, all activities must be virtual), then we are very open to that,” he said.

      "PHILIPPINE vaccine retailer Family Vaccine & Specialty Clinics, through IP Biotech and Ambica International Corporation, signed an exclusive agreement with Bharat Biotech International Ltd to import and distribute Covaxin, India’s Covd-19 vaccine candidate, upon completion of ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials and FDA approval.The partnership with Family Vaccine & Specialty Clinics (FVSC) and Ambica International Corporation, both Philippine-based vaccine and pharmaceutical companies, with Bharat Biotech, one of the foremost Covid-19 vaccine developers worldwide, would enable the Philippines to access Covaxin in the near future.\n",
      "“At Ambica International, our goal is to provide greater accessibility to essential healthcare products to improve the wellbeing of Filipinos throughout the nation. The partnership between Bharat Biotech International and IP Biotech for the distribution of Covaxin is a testament to that,\" said Ambica International.Covaxin, India's indigenous Covid-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech, is developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV). This indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) bio-containment facility.Covaxin is a highly purified and inactivated two-dose Sars-CoV-2 vaccine, manufactured in a vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses.\n",
      "Covaxin has been evaluated in approximately 1,000 subjects in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, with promising safety and immunogenicity results. It is one of the few vaccines to be tested in live virus challenge studies in both hamsters and primates, with successful results.The Phase III human clinical trials of Covaxin began in November, involving 26,000 volunteers across India. This is India’s first and only Phase III efficacy study for a Covid-19 vaccine, and the largest phase III efficacy trial ever conducted for any vaccine in India.Suchitra Ella, joint managing director of Bharat Biotech, said: “The development and clinical evaluation of Covaxin marks a significant milestone for novel vaccinology in India. Covaxin has garnered interest from several countries worldwide for supplies and introduction. It’s an honor for us to contribute in this global fight against the pandemic and to note that vaccines from India will be made available to global populations.” (PR)\n",

      "Labella, who is in constant communication with the Covid-19 vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez, also asked him, if possible, to provide Cebu City with AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines.Labella in a press conference on Jan. 6, 2021: “In my conversation with Secretary Galvez, he told me that Cebu City is one of the priorities. I told him we are ready to augment whatever the national government will provide.”In the City’s Annual Investment Plan (AIP) which was approved in October, P500 million was allocated to buy the Covid-19 vaccine.\n",

      "ALTHOUGH developers have released the efficacy rates of their candidate vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said nobody can determine yet if any of these vaccines are effective.A vaccine’s efficacy rate, which determines the degree to which it prevents a disease during clinical trials, differs from its effectiveness, which is measured when the vaccine is administered to the public.\n",
      "In a virtual press briefing, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire disagreed with the conclusion of Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque that Sinovac vaccines had a high efficacy rate among Indonesians.\"Just for the information of everybody, no one can really know yet if the vaccine will be effective or not. At least not right now,\" Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing Friday, January 15, 2021.\"The outcome in the population, that will be measured and it will take long. We cannot see yet if it is effective or not,\" she added.\n",
      "Vergeire said vaccine experts have pointed out that it will take several months up to a year before a vaccine’s effectiveness can be measured.\"Once the vaccination is completed, we need to wait for about six months to a year before we are able to reduce deaths or reduce the number of cases,\" she said.SinovacShe was reacting to Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque’s statement that the vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech of China posted a high efficacy rate in Indonesia.Roque sought to defend government’s purchase of 25 million doses of Sinovac vaccines on Friday.Vergeire, however, agreed with Roque that Filipinos cannot afford to be picky because the supply of Covid-19 vaccines is still limited while global demand is high.\n",
      "\"We need to understand that the government is having this vaccination program to protect the whole Filipino population. That is the objective. At this point, we won't be giving an option which type of vaccine can be availed by an individual,\" said Vergeire.\"These vaccines forthcoming are the ones that (are) committed to the country. And we all know how much is the global competition for these vaccines,\" she added.Nevertheless, the health official assured the public that each vaccine that will be administered in the country shall undergo stringent evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\"We want to give the assurance that all vaccines will go through our process for regulation and all of these vaccines that will get the authorization would be safe and effective for everybody,\" said Vergeire.She stressed that no one will be forced to get immunized.Vaccine passportMeanwhile, the DOH said there is high likelihood that a \"vaccine passport\" policy will be implemented in the country in the future.Vergeire said there is logic behind requiring travelers to be immunized against Covid-19 before they are allowed to enter or exit the country.\"This vaccine passport, I believe, will be implemented. And when it is widely implemented already, it will be part of protocols to control the borders of each country around the globe,\" said Vergeire.\"A vaccine passport or this card will certify that you are vaccinated,\" she furthered.She said the Philippines is already looking forward to such a policy by having a registry for those who will get inoculated.\"We will have a QR code for each individual that will be immunized,\" she said.\"This would be something of a unique identifier for each person that will receive (the) vaccine,” added Vergeire.

      "THE National Government will start giving Covid-19 vaccine shots to medical frontliners, senior citizens and indigents in Cebu by the middle of February 2021.Thus said Secretary Martin Andanar of the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) during his visit to Cebu on Tuesday, Jan. 19.\n",
      "Andanar led the PCOO’s #ExplainExplainExplain campaign, which focuses on explaining to the different localities government’s strategy on the use of Covid-19 vaccines.“We want to start it as soon as possible, especially in major cities with a high attack rate — Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, Metro Davao, Cagayan de Oro,” Andanar said.The Philippine government is targeting to vaccinate at least two million Filipinos by April this year.Andanar said local government units (LGUs) will serve as major partners of the national government in the distribution of the vaccines.Andanar did not disclose the vaccine brand to be used but assured the National Government is not favoring a specific brand or country from which the vaccines come.But Andanar said one of the challenges government will face once the roll-out starts is on how to deal with logistical and storage problems.Government aims to vaccinate most of the citizens to ensure that herd immunity is developed against the Covid-19, Andanar said.Andanar said while rich countries like the United States and those in Europe have started Covid-19 vaccinations, they are now being plagued with problems such as overabundance of vaccine supply and spoilage due to improper storage.“We cannot make that same mistake. The Covid-19 vaccine is our hope. But if we cannot manage it well, it could also be our pitfall,” Andanar said.\n",
      "The national government has been assured of at least 130 million doses from pharmaceutical companies and countries that have developed Covid vaccines.The number could increase to 172 million doses by next year, Andanar said.“It’s not a question of whether or not the vaccine will arrive. The question is how do we manage it,” Andanar said.Cebu nursesThe Philippine Nurses Association (PNA) Cebu welcomed Andanar’s announcement, saying they appreciate government’s effort to protect heroes, especially nurses and other health care workers.“As promoter of health, we believe in the importance of vaccination as long as it is scientifically based and (there is) no short cutting of the procedures. As long as it underwent trials based on the standards of food and drug authorities,” the group said in a statement sent to SunStar Cebu through Dr. Joseph Descallar, PNA governor of Central Visayas.“We further appeal to the government that nurses who will do the vaccination be given just compensation and proper protection as they once (again) risk their lives for the Filipino people,” the PNA Cebu added.Public-Private PartnershipIn Mandaue City, Mayor Jonas Cortes said the Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) is willing to procure vaccines for their employees and donate some to the city.“This is a sort of public-private partnership to lessen the appropriation of the city,” said Cortes in Cebuano.MCCI president Steven Yu said at least 60 companies have already signified their readiness to join.Yu said the list will continue to grow as they come closer to finalizing their vaccine supplier.Yu said companies consider this their corporate social responsibility (CSR) to their employees and the city.“The vaccine may not solve all the pandemic issues, but it represents a shining light at the end of the tunnel to the devastated business community who can’t take any more prolonged slowdown,” said Yu.Meanwhile, a Covid-19 vaccine board tasked to appropriate the vaccines has also been established, Cortes said.The board headed by Association of Barangay Captains (ABC) President Ernie Manatad is composed of City Health Office (CHO) head Dr. Dominga Obenza, Emergency Operations Center (EOC) head August Lizer Malate and City Management Information Systems Office (MISO) head Krister Cosedo.Cortes said the board has been tasked to formulate a system on how to distribute the vaccine following guidelines to be provided by the National Government.

(Unilab) in Biñan, Laguna.\n",
      "Unilab’s cold storage facility within the Unilab Pharma Campus can store around five million doses of vaccine at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. It has been identified as one of the major storage hubs for Covid-19 vaccines.“When we go into partnership with the government for the warehousing and logistics for the Covid-19 vaccines, I can assure it is going to be done as a service and not as a business,” said Jose Maria Ochave, Unilab senior vice president for social partnership.Duque and Galvez also visited the cold storage facility of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), which can also store at a temperature of as low as 2 degrees Celsius.\n",
      "They also visited the facilities of Zuellig Pharma, which has also committed support for the rollout of the vaccines.Zuellig CEO Maikel Kuijpers said they have increased the combined capacity of their cold storage facilities across the country to 650 million doses at any given time.Zuellig has cold storage facilities capable of ultra-low temperatures of -80 degrees Celsius, which is required for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. These facilities can store up to 6.5 million doses.The company's walk-in freezers, capable of temperatures ranging from -50 to -25 degrees Celsius, can hold 40 million doses.Secretary Vince Dizon, deputy chief implementer of the National Task Force Against Covid-19, said in a press conference that they were in talks with 28 cold chain services providers that can also store vaccines at low temperatures.Negotiations were also being held with five other cold chain operators, he added.\n",
      "The government expects delivery of at least 92 million doses of candidate vaccines against Covid-19 this year.As of January 19, Malacañang said Galvez has secured the supply of 30 million doses from Novavax, 25 million doses from Sinovac, 17 million doses from AstraZeneca and 20 million doses from Moderna.The first shipment of 50,000 doses from Sinovac is expected to arrive on February 20. It will be followed by 950,000 doses in March, and two to three million doses a month until December.An undetermined volume of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also expected to arrive in the country in February through the Covax initiative of the World Health Organization.Covax is a pooled procurement mechanism that will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines. The Philippines has been listed among the 92 low- and middle-income economies which will benefit from a subsidy from the Gavi vaccine alliance.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will require storage temperature of -80 to -60 degrees Celsius.The other vaccine brands are seen to be deployed in the third quarter of 2021.]Galvez earlier said they are targeting to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos, roughly half of the Philippine population, to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19.

      "CAN I take painkillers before or after a Covid-19 vaccine?It's best to avoid them, unless you routinely take them for a medical condition. Although the evidence is limited, some painkillers might interfere with the very thing the vaccine is trying to do: generate a strong immune system response.\n",
      "Vaccines work by tricking the body into thinking it has a virus and mounting a defense against it. That may cause arm soreness, fever, headache, muscle aches or other temporary symptoms of inflammation that can be part of that reaction.“These symptoms mean your immune system is revving up and the vaccine is working,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a recent news briefing.Certain painkillers that target inflammation, including ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and other brands) might curb the immune response. A study on mice in the Journal of Virology found these drugs might lower production of antibodies — helpful substances that block the virus from infecting cells.\n",
      "If you're already taking one of those medications for a health condition, you should not stop before you get the vaccine — at least not without asking your doctor, said Jonathan Watanabe, a pharmacist at the University of California, Irvine.People should not take a painkiller as a preventive measure before getting a vaccine unless a doctor has told them to, he said. The same goes for after a shot: “If you don’t need to take it, you shouldn’t,” Watanabe said.If you do need one, acetaminophen (Tylenol) “is safer because it doesn’t alter your immune response,” he added.The CDC offers other tips, such as holding a cool, wet washcloth over the area of the shot and exercising that arm. For fever, drink lots of fluids and dress lightly.Call your doctor if redness or tenderness in the arm increases after a day or if side effects don’t go away after a few days, the CDC says. (AP)\n",

(ICTSI); and Manuel Pangilinan, chairman of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation.Others that pitched in and attended the signing ceremony were the Lopez Group, Philippine National Bank, Philippine Franchise Association, LBC Express, Udenna Corporation, Aboitiz Corporation, AC Health, Penshoppe, Philippine TransMarine Carriers Group, GT Capital Holdings, Wilcon Depot, Magsaysay People Resource Corporation, Yazaki Torres Manufacturing, Filinvest Corporation and EastWest Bank, Jollibee Group, Double Dragon Properties and MerryMart, Mercury Drug Corporation, Seaoil Philippines, Concepcion Industrial Corporation, Bounty Agro Ventures Inc., Century Properties Group, and the Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry.The vaccines are expected to be delivered in May or June 2021. Each dose costs $5, the lowest price for a potential vaccine against Covid-19.Clinical trialsAstraZeneca has filed an application to conduct clinical trials for its vaccine candidate in the Philippines.Jaime Montoya, executive director of the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, said the Philippines is the only country in Southeast Asia being eyed by AstraZeneca for its clinical trials.He said they were waiting for AstraZeneca to submit their data on its clinical trials.“You know, we have no way of verifying it until they submit their official documents which we will have to verify based on the data they will present. As I understand it, they are presently evaluating and analyzing where the errors where and why these happened.He said, however, that he does not foresee any effect on the vaccine’s efficacy.“It’s just a question of numbers and the basis for such numbers,” he added.AstraZeneca earlier reported that the vaccine AZD1222 it is developing together with the University of Oxford is “highly effective” in preventing Covid-19 based on an interim analysis of clinical trials in the UK and Brazil.Researchers found that efficacy is higher when the vaccine is administered in one-and-a-half doses instead of the usual two doses.Reports alleged that this was established after a batch of volunteers were accidentally given only a half dose initially.AstraZeneca said the vaccine showed an efficacy of 90 percent when it was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart.Efficacy was 62 percent when given as two full doses at least one month apart.The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 percent, the company added.No hospitalizations or severe cases of the disease were reported in the 131 participants in the clinical trials.

      "BERLIN — Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has agreed to supply 9 million additional doses of its coronavirus vaccine to the European Union during the first quarter, the bloc's executive arm said Sunday.The new target of 40 million doses by the end of March is still only half what the British-Swedish company had originally aimed for before it announced a shortfall due to production problems, triggering a spat between AstraZeneca and the EU last week.\n",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said after a call with seven vaccine makers Sunday that AstraZeneca will also begin deliveries one week sooner than scheduled and expand its manufacturing capacity in Europe.“Step forward on vaccines,” tweeted Von der Leyen, who has come under intense pressure over the European Commission's handling of the vaccine orders in recent days.The EU is far behind Britain and the United States in getting its population of 450 million vaccinated against the virus. The slow rollout has been blamed on a range of national problems as well as slower authorization of the vaccines and an initial shortage of supply.\n",
      "AstraZeneca's announcement last week that it would initially supply only 31 million doses to the EU's 27 member states due to production problems set off a fierce dispute between the two sides, with officials in Brussels saying they feared the company was treating the bloc unfairly compared to other customers, such as the United Kingdom.On Friday, hours after regulators authorized the vaccine for use across the EU, the commission said it was tightening rules on exports of coronavirus vaccines, sparking an angry response from Britain. The commission has since made clear the new measure will not limit vaccine shipments produced in the 27-nation bloc to Northern Ireland, a U.K. territory that was guaranteed unhindered cross-border access to the Republic of Ireland under the post-Brexit deal between Britain and the EU.EU member states praised the bloc's executive branch last year for signing numerous deals with vaccine makers, saying the joint purchase using the combined market weight of the entire bloc had ensured a fair distribution for all 27 countries at good prices.Since then the mood among many EU citizens toward Brussels has soured, as countries outside the bloc speed ahead in the race to vaccinate their populations.The British government hasn't been shy about promoting its relative vaccine success, which has helped distract from the fact that the country remains top of the table for deaths in Europe.Official figures show 598,389 shots were administered across the U.K. on Saturday, more than six times the number that Germany managed Friday, the last day for which figures were available.\n",
      "Germany has so far given at least one dose to 2.2% of its population. Britain has done the same for 13.2% of its citizens.In response, Chancellor Angela Merkel has summoned state governors Monday to discuss what German media are describing as a “vaccination debacle. \"Von der Leyen, who was Germany's defense minister before taking the post in Brussels, insisted the EU had “made good progress.”“Of course we've currently got a difficult phase,” she told German public broadcaster ZDF, but added that in the second quarter more vaccine would become available as regulators approve additional formulas and further production capacity goes online.Pfizer, which developed the first widely tested and approved coronavirus vaccine together with German firm BioNTech, has said it expects to increase global production this year from 1.3 million doses to 2 billion doses. Tens of millions of those will likely go to the EU.In a statement, the European Commission said it plans to set up an specialized body to improve the bloc’s response to health emergency and “deliver a more structured approach to pandemic preparedness.”As part of the effort, together with industry, the EU said it will “fund design and development of vaccines and scale up manufacturing in the short and medium term, and also to target the variants of Covid-19.”“The pandemic highlighted that manufacturing capacities are a limiting factor,” it said. “It is essential to address these challenges.” (AP)\n",

      "My main employer, GMA 7 Network Inc., has conducted a survey among employees who want to be vaccinated against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Maybe the company is planning to purchase its own vaccines for its employees and will not wait for the government‘s free vaccination program. Media people are not on the priority list of those to be inoculated.Admittedly, I am still undecided whether to avail myself or not if there is any vaccine to be given for free from the management. If I will submit myself, maybe I will choose the brand of vaccine. Not because I am against vaccination but I have just a little reservation like so many others. This is maybe because I give more weight to the negative results of the vaccine based on the articles I have read. I have some friends even from the medical profession who, like me, are skeptical about the vaccine. But if the company’s vaccination is a must among GMA 7 employees, then who am I to refuse?\n",
      "A coronavirus vaccine has been heralded as the key to returning to some semblance of normal life but public health experts will first need to convince people to take it for it to be effective.Even though vaccines have virtually eliminated the risk of many preventable diseases, there have been an increase in refusal and hesitancy over the past decades. In the United States, vaccine refusal is most prevalent in wealthy, white areas and marginalized communities. Here in the country, it is a cross section in the community who are hesitant specially the parents because they still have a phobia of Dengvaxia, the anti-dengue vaccine, where many children died. Even professionals and those in the higher strata of society are hesitant because of what happened in Norway where several people aged 80 above died after being vaccinated.In January, a survey conducted by Octa Research, an independent survey group updating Covid-19 cases, showed that only 25 percent of respondents in Metro Manila are willing to get an anti-coronavirus vaccine shot when it is available. Of the 600 respondents aged 18 and up, only 25 percent are willing to be vaccinated. Most of the 29 percent of those inclined to get a vaccine were from the upper income class and middle class. Only one out of four people wants to be vaccinated, the survey showed.\n",
      "You see the percentage of those skeptical? The number one reason these people are hesitant is because they fear for their safety. It is now the problem of the government to convince them otherwise. It is tempting for public health communicators to dismiss those who are refusers or hesitant by broadly labelling them as conspiracy theorists or misinformed skeptics who would come around if given the facts. But mistrusting the coronavirus vaccine process — from development to trials to distribution — cannot merely be dismissed as “anti-science” thinking. It is not just an outcome of this moment’s political polarization and dangerous misinformation coming from the highest level of leadership.There are so many black propaganda and fake news about the vaccine which is one of the reasons some people are skeptical. One is because of religion or faith. In Iran, a religious leader told his supporters, especially males, not to submit themselves for vaccination because it will turn them gay.Pagkatoytoy!Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian made these claims on messaging platform Telegram, where he has almost 210,000 followers, The Jerusalem Post reported. According to the publication, Tabrizian wrote on the platform, “Don’t go near those who have had the Covid vaccine. They have become homosexuals.” But the Iranian cleric was criticized by the LGBT community for “demonizing both the vaccine and gay community.” The claim of Tabrizian combines scientific ignorance with a crude appeal to homophobia. Homosexuality is prohibited in Iran, an Islam dominated country.Some misleading information against the vaccine is nearly identical to claims made about smallpox immunization 120 years ago. The ingredients are toxic and unnatural; the vaccine is insufficiently tested; the scientists who produce them are quack and profiteers; the cell cultures involved in some shots are an affront to the religious; the authorities work to protect public health are guilty of tyrannical overreach; and many others.How to counter these black propaganda is the problem of our government. In fact, only very few parents have allowed their children to be vaccinated in the ongoing immunization program for measles, rubella and polio because of fear.Maybe I want to see President Duterte get vaccinated in public before I submit myself to one. He is the number one endorser for the vaccination program. In the meantime, just give me enough time to think.\n"

      "DAVAO City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio announced on Monday, January 11, that the City Government formally signed a contract with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Inc., which committed to deliver initial doses of its Covid-19 vaccines to the city by third quarter of 2021.“Ang latest pirmado na tanang contracts gipangayo sa atoa sa AstraZeneca. Gitagaan na ta og authority sa SP (Sangguniang Panlungsod) na mupirma (We already signed the contracts asked of us by AstraZeneca. The Sangguniang Panlungsod has given us the authority to sign),” Duterte-Carpio said in a radio interview.\n",
      "The mayor said they already submitted the necessary documents to the drug company who will be the one who to publicize the agreements it made with the city government.Duterte-Carpio said the initial negotiations with AstraZeneca were seamless and they did not encounter any problem.“Wala man mi’y problema sa ilaha kay as early as October nagsulat na ta sa ilaha sa atong interest nga mupalit og bakuna sa ilaha (We didn’t have any problem dealing with AstraZeneca as we wrote them early October, signifying our interest to buy vaccines from them),” she said.\n",
      "The negotiation between the City Government and AstraZeneca commenced after the 19th City Council approved on Friday, January 8, an ordinance authorizing the mayor to enter into and sign for and on behalf of the City Government the multilateral agreement between AstraZeneca, Philippine government, Department of Health, and city government for the procurement and acquisition of AZD1222 Vaccine.But the mayor said the city will still be getting its Covid-19 vaccines from multiple sources since AstraZeneca cannot commit to deliver bulk supply to the city.Based on the city's estimated population, which is around 1.8 million, Duterte-Carpio said at least 1.2 million Dabawenyos are targeted to be administered with Covid-19 vaccine to achieve \"herd immunity.\"Meanwhile, her supposed meeting with another vaccine maker scheduled on January 8 was reset as the manufacturer also had a meeting with vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.She did not name the vaccine developer as she would need their permission to do so.She said, however, that they will prioritize talks with companies that intend to apply for emergency use authorization (EUA) and product registration in the country.Safety concernsBased on survey by the University of Mindanao-Institute of Popular Opinion (UM-IPO), conducted from December 7 to 19, 2020, two out of 10 Dabawenyos expressed unwillingness to get the vaccine because of possible side effects, fear of complication, personal mistrust in vaccines, lack of empirical clinical studies affirming the safety of the vaccine, among others.Also, three out of 10 of the respondents expressed uncertainty whether to get the vaccine or not, \"with key reasons of uncertainty such as uncertainty of the efficacy of the vaccines, personal decision to observe the situation first, possible side effects to the body, general skepticism on vaccines and the like.\"AstraZeneca Philippines Medical Affairs director Dr. Cyril Tolosa said in a special session at the City Council on Friday, January 8, that their vaccines are \"well-tolerated,\" which means most people will not experience side effects.\"It showed and demonstrated based on a clinical trial that it is well tolerated by the human body,\" Tolosa said.He, however, said, \"We're not saying this is 100 percent, meaning there will be no side effect. Even with the current drugs that we are using, there will always be side effects.\"Among the possible side effects that people might experience are fever and chills, which are the usual side effects of a vaccine. He said this can be remedied by taking paracetamol.Duterte-Carpio admitted that the city received reports through word of mouth that some Dabawenyos are hesitant to get the Covid-19 vaccine.This was raised in the recent Davao City Covid-19 Task Force meeting.She said there is a need to roll out an information dissemination drive to let the public be informed about the vaccine.She also said they are waiting for the Department of Health (DOH) to release information materials as these will also be used by the city in its information campaign.\"We are hoping na dunay mamahimong ing-ana sa pagpasabot nga gikan sa DOH about sa Covid-19 vaccine. Para it will be the same message and materials that will be used by the city government (We are hoping that DOH will be doing a massive information dissemination on the Covid-19 vaccines so that the message and the materials that they will be using will be the same that the city will use),\" Duterte-Carpio said.\"Kung wala, kita mismo mag-develop sa atong kaugalingon nga pagpasabot and pag-explain sa mga tao about sa Covid-19 vaccines (But if they still do not have, we will be developing our own materials to let the public understand and explain to them the Covid-19 vaccines),\" Duterte-Carpio added.The mayor, however, said the drafted Covid-19 Vaccination Program, which will be deliberated in the 19th City Council in the coming days, will not be mandatory.\n",

      "LLOYD dela Cruz was born and raised in the beautiful province of Cebu and now lives in Vancouver, Canada. He would probably be one of the first few people I know who has received the controversial Covid vaccine.In my chat groups, our friends and family are divided if we will ever receive the vaccine, if and when it actually becomes available to us. As of today, there is no definite plan for the roll-out of vaccines in the Philippines. It is good to know though that several of our Filipino frontliners abroad have already gotten their dose.\n",
      "Lloyd is one of them. He works in an acute care hospital and he does rotation to different wards such as the Covid unit, palliative care, oncology departments, Neuroscience, orthopedic and trauma departments. With his role in the hospital, he was a candidate for the vaccine provided for by the government of Canada. He got it for free and did not need to have health or private insurance to receive it.The one that he was jabbed with was the Pfizer/Bio Ntech vaccine. He just got soreness on the inoculated site and a slight headache, which were typical symptoms he gets when he gets his annual flu shot.He took two doses, the second dose was administered to him 21 days after the first dose. According to Lloyd, he felt entirely normal, with no unusual changes in his body. Even after the vaccine, he still has to follow the guidelines from the provincial health orders because he said he can still be a carrier of the virus and can still pass it on to someone. Getting the vaccine for him did not require any changes to his diet or activity. It was just like getting a flu shot.\n",
      "I feel that the series I will run regarding Covid vaccines and real people who have taken the vaccine will put some people at ease that this vaccine is our chance if we ever want to get back to normal life. Of course, we still do not know the long term effects of the vaccine. But Lloyd says, so far, so good.***Follow me on twitter @missheiding, Instagram @missheiding\n",

      "A TOTAL of 222,247 children nine to 59 months old in Central Visayas have received measles-rubella (MR) vaccine under the second phase of the MR Oral Polio Vaccine Supplementary Immunization Activity (MR OPV SIA) phase two as of Feb. 10, 2021, the 10th day of the month-long vaccination campaign of the Department of Health (DOH).In a report issued on Thursday, Feb. 11, the DOH 7 said the inoculated children covers 32.06 percent of 693,210 children that the agency targets to administer with supplementary MR vaccine until the end of February.\n",
      "Cebu City, which has the fourth highest number of target children, currently has the lowest coverage for MR vaccine SIA at 20.38 percent—Of the 87,921 target number of eligible children, the DOH 7 has yet to vaccinate 70,000 children in the city.The top 10 performing barangays for the MR vaccination in Cebu City include Barangays Sudlon 1, Sudlon 2, Sinsin, Pamutan, Tabunan, Sirao, Binaliw, Mabini, Bonbon and Pit-os. These are mountain villages with less population.In Cebu Province, a total of 89,871 (32.09 percent) children were vaccinated.

      "Measles is a highly contagious viral disease transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons.Polio vaccineThe DOH 7 also vaccinated a total of 263,649 children or 32.32 percent of its target number of eligible children for the oral polio vaccine (OPV).Of the total number of children vaccinated, 21,310 are from Cebu City; 41,215, Negros Oriental; 14,225, Lapu Lapu City; 107,360, Cebu Province; 16,259, Mandaue City; 58,663, Bohol; and 4,617, Siquijor.Of the 815,641 eligible children (zero to 59 months old) for the OPV, a total of 103,819 comes from Cebu City; 142,955, Negros Oriental; 45,926, Lapu Lapu City; 330,719, Cebu Province; 40,802, Mandaue City; 142,369, Bohol; and 9,051, Siquijor.Poliomyelitis is a viral disease that invades the person’s nervous system and can cause total paralysis. It is transmitted via person-to-person; it is spread mainly through the fecal-oral route and it can also spread through contaminated water or food.\n",
      "Parents encouragedThe DOH 7 continues to encourage the parents of eligible children to join the supplementary immunization.Dr. Joan Antonette Albito, medical coordinator of the National Immunization Program of the DOH 7, said the SIA is intended to complement and not replace the routine immunization.She said the objective of the MR OPV SIA is to catch children who are either non-immunized or only partially protected against measles-rubella and poliomyelitis diseases, and it also boosts the immunity of children who had been vaccinated.

      "UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sharply criticized the “wildly uneven and unfair” distribution of Covid-19 vaccines on Wednesday, saying 10 countries have administered 75 percent of all vaccinations and demanding a global effort to get all people in every nation vaccinated as soon as possible.The U.N. chief told a high-level meeting of the U.N. Security Council that 130 countries have not received a single dose of vaccine and declared that “at this critical moment, vaccine equity is the biggest moral test before the global community.”\n",
      "Guterres called for an urgent Global Vaccination Plan to bring together those with the power to ensure equitable vaccine distribution -- scientists, vaccine producers and those who can fund the effort.And he called on the world’s major economic powers in the Group of 20 to establish an emergency task force to establish a plan and coordinate its implementation and financing. He said the task force should have the capacity “to mobilize the pharmaceutical companies and key industry and logistics actors.”Guterres said Friday’s meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations -- the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Canada and Italy -- “can create the momentum to mobilize the necessary financial resources.”\n",
      "Thirteen ministers addressed the virtual council meeting organized by Britain on improving access to Covid-19 vaccinations, including in conflict areas.The coronavirus has infected more than 109 million people and killed at least 2.4 million of them. As manufacturers struggle to ramp up production of vaccines, many countries complain of being left out and even rich nations are facing shortages and domestic complaints.The World Health Organization’s COVAX program, an ambitious project to buy and deliver coronavirus vaccines for the world’s poorest people, has already missed its own goal of beginning coronavirus vaccinations in poor countries at the same time that shots were rolled out in rich countries. WHO says COVAX needs $5 billion in 2021.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the council the Biden administration “will work with our partners across the globe to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity and to increase access, including to marginalized populations.”President Joe Biden has rejoined the WHO and Blinken announced that by the end of February the United States will pay over $200 million in previously assessed and current obligations to the U.N. agency, which Washington will seek to reform.America's top diplomat said the U.S. also plans to provide “significant financial support” to COVAX through the GAVI vaccine alliance, and will work to strengthen other multilateral initiatives involved in the global Covid-19 response.

      "China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticized the growing “immunity divide” and called on the world to “come together to reject `vaccine nationalism,’ promote fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, and, in particular, make them accessible and affordable for developing countries, including those in conflict.”At WHO’s request, he said, China will contribute 10 million doses of vaccines to COVAX “preliminarily.”China has donated vaccines to 53 developing countries including Somalia, Iraq, South Sudan and Palestine, which is a U.N. observer state. It has also exported vaccines to 22 countries, he said, adding that Beijing has launched research and development cooperation on Covid-19 with more than 10 countries.India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar also called for a halt to “vaccine nationalism” and encouragement for internationalism. “Hoarding superfluous doses will defeat our efforts towards attaining collective health security,” he warned.Jaishankar said India has been at the forefront of the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, initially providing medicine, ventilators and personal protective equipment and now directly sending made-in-India vaccines to 25 nations across the world, with 49 additional countries from Europe and Latin America to Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands slated to receive vaccines “in the coming days.”Two vaccines, including one developed in India, have been granted emergency authorization, the minister said, and as many as 30 vaccine candidates are in various stages of development.Jaishankar announced “a gift of 200,000 doses” of vaccine for about 90,000 U.N. peacekeepers serving in a dozen hotspots around the world.Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, whose country is currently president of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, called for speeding up COVAX and stopping the ”undue hoarding” and “monopolization of vaccines.”He urged that priority be given to countries with limited resources, saying “it’s been pointed out that these countries won’t have generalized access until the middle of 2023 if current trends persist.”“What we are seeing is a huge gap,” Ebrard said. “In fact, I don’t think we’ve ever seen such a huge division affecting so many in such a short space of time. That is why it’s important to reverse this.\"He urged the international community not to establish mechanisms that could prevent the speedy delivery of vaccines but instead to strengthen supply chains “that will promote and guarantee universal access.”British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, whose country holds the Security Council presidency this month and presided at the virtual meeting, urged the U.N.’s most powerful body to adopt a resolution calling for local cease-fires in conflict zones to allow the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines.“Cease-fires have been used to vaccinate the most vulnerable communities in the past,” he said. “There’s no reason why we can’t... We have seen it in the past to deliver polio vaccines to children in Afghanistan, just to take one example.”Britain says more than 160 million people are at risk of being excluded from coronavirus vaccinations because they live in countries engulfed in conflict and instability, including Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia.Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward said: “Humanitarian organizations and U.N. agencies need the full backing of the council to be able to carry out the job we are asking them to do.”Britain has drafted a Security Council resolution that the U.K. hopes will be adopted in the coming weeks, she said.Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, objected to the council focusing on equitable access to vaccines, saying this went beyond its mandate to preserve international peace and security.Indicating Moscow was not interested in a new resolution. he said Russia is ready to discuss progress on implementing the only resolution the Security Council has adopted on the pandemic. After three months of difficult negotiations, the council last July 1 endorsed fhe secretary-general’s call for cease-fires in major global conflicts to tackle Covid-19.Britain’s Raab argued that the council needs to follow up and call for cease-fires “specifically to enable Covid vaccines to be carried out in those areas so badly affected by conflict.” (AP)\n"

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union's drug agency on Friday, January 8, approved doctors drawing up to six doses from each vial of the coronavirus vaccine made by BioNTech-Pfizer, a move that could speed up the pace of vaccinations in the 27-nation bloc.The European Medicines Agency said its human medicines committee recommended updating the product information for the vaccine to clarify that each vial contains six doses instead of the five that were advised when it originally greenlighted the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Dec. 21.\n",
      "German Health Ministry spokesman Hanno Kautz told reporters in Berlin that the change would come into effect immediately, boosting available doses of the vaccine by 20 percent.Many doctors across the EU have already been drawing six doses of the vaccine from each vial, a practice that is already permitted in the United States, Britain and elsewhere.Pharmaceutical companies regularly put more vaccine than necessary into vials so minimum dosage can be ensured even if there is some spillage.\n",
      "The news came shortly after the EU’s executive arm said it had secured 300 million extra doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the new agreement to buy more doses will double the amount ordered by the 27-nation bloc.The EU commission later detailed in a statement that it offered to member states to purchase an additional 200 million doses of the vaccine, with the option to acquire another 100 million doses.“This would enable the EU to purchase up to 600 million doses of this vaccine, which is already being used across the EU. The additional doses will be delivered starting in the second quarter of 2021,” the EU said. Von der Leyen said 75 million of the extra doses would be available during the second quarter, with the rest being delivered throughout 2021.Combined with a contract with Moderna for its vaccine, the EU now has the capacity to vaccinate 380 million people, Von der Leyen said, more than 80 percent of the EU's population.The EU has sealed six vaccine contracts for up to 2 billion doses, with Moderna, AstraZeneca-Oxford, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Pfizer-BioNTech and CureVac. But only the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been approved for use so far in the 27-nation bloc.At an online public meeting to discuss the drug agency's work reviewing vaccines, EMA Executive Director Emer Cooke said the process of assessing a third vaccine, made by AstraZeneca, could be completed by the end of January.\n",
      "\"This will, of course, depend on the data we receive and the evaluation progress,\" she said. \"Once we actually receive the application, we will make a public announcement on this.\"Also Friday, Britain authorized the vaccine developed by Moderna, the third to be licensed for use in the country.The U.K. Department of Health said that the vaccine met British regulators' “strict standards of safety, efficacy and quality.”Britain has ordered 10 million doses of the vaccine, though it is not expected to be delivered to the UK until spring. So far Britain has inoculated 1.5 million people with the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines.The European Commission's announcement came amid growing criticism, notably in Germany, about the decision to let the commission handle vaccine purchases for all EU member nations. Vaccination programs in the EU have gotten off to a slow start, and some EU members have been quick to blame the European Commission for a perceived failure to deliver the right number of doses.The EU has defended its strategy, insisting that vaccination programs have just started and that large deliveries are foreseen for around April.“We were faced with a situation where we had huge demand, but the production capacity had not kept pace with that as yet. Now, we have a positive step forward,\" von der Leyen said.After Germany secured extra doses from BioNTech, a German company, outside the EU agreements, von der Leyen made clear that individual negotiations would violate the agreement accepted by all the bloc's members.\"We have all agreed, legally binding, that there would be no parallel negotiations, no parallel contract,\" she said. \"So the framework we are all working in is a framework of 27. Together we are negotiating, together we are procuring and together we are bringing forward this vaccination process.\"But German Health Ministry spokesman Hanno Kautz said that the deal with BioNTech “is compatible with the EU agreements. The extra allocations we have secured do not disrupt the other contracts.”“That is a precondition for the memorandums of understanding we concluded,” Kautz told reporters in Berlin. “Delivery also will not be affected by this. No other EU member state will get vaccines later from BioNTech, for example, just because Germany has secured additional doses of vaccine or a commitment for additional doses of vaccine.”Kautz made clear that the bilaterally secured 30 million doses would be delivered after those ordered via the EU, though they are still expected this year.

      "THE Bacolod City Council has approved the request of Mayor Evelio Leonardia for authority, and on a continuing basis, to enter into a contract with any pharmaceutical company legally operating in the country for the availment of Covid-19 vaccines duly approved by the Philippine Food and Drug Administration as acceptable for use by the city’s residents.Vice Mayor El Cid Familiaran said Monday, January 11, 2021, the mayor’s request was approved during the regular session Friday afternoon.\n",
      "In his letter addressed to the City Council, the mayor said the availability of Covid-19 vaccines is limited, considering the massive nationwide demand for it.“We are bound to encounter problems in its timely availment if we do not act now to ensure that we are on the list of local government units which are ready to avail of any vaccine supply that the national government shall be able to procure under existing policies and procedures, and subject to adjustments that the national government may eventually adopt thereon,” Leonardia said.The City Council also earlier approved the request of the mayor for authority to sign the multilateral agreement to purchase in advance vaccines against Covid-19.\n",
      "On January 7, Leonardia signed the multilateral and confidentiality agreement with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines Inc. for the advance purchase of the vaccines.The city government already allotted a total of P300 million for the advance purchase of the vaccines.“This is to assure you that Bacolod City is on track and Bacolod is on time,” Leonardia said.He said they do not have a clear cut date as to when the vaccines will arrive in Bacolod.He added, for now, they could not give the exact number of vaccines for Bacolod due to the confidentiality agreement.AstraZeneca plc is a British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Cambridge, England.Once the vaccine against Covid-19 is available, the city government will prioritize medical frontliners, health workers, indigents, senior citizens, policemen and contact tracers.Aside from the local budget, the national government will also assist with the Covid-19 vaccines. Some of the private companies in Bacolod City are also willing to shoulder the vaccines for their employees.\n",

      "THE common response to a recent survey on whether they would take the vaccine against Covid-19 was that of wait and see–wait for what will happen before we decide, or let others be first then we will see.Well, the list of people wanting to go first to help boost confidence in the vaccination program against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is growing longer. And they’re willing to do it in public. Perhaps à la influencer on social media for better impact and wider reach.\n",
      "The government’s vaccination program is working on a priority list based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. At the top of the list are medical frontliners who have to be strong enough to care for the sick, followed by the elderly, indigent and law enforcers.To try to convince majority of Filipinos to have themselves vaccinated, there are local government officials and Church leaders and members who are offering themselves to be among the first to get inoculated in order to show others that the vaccine is safe.Church leaders and priests are among those joining the line to have a jab, and there’s the suggestion that they do it in public or on television so more people can watch.\n",
      "Take the case of Fr. Nicanor Austriaco, a Filipino Dominican priest and molecular biologist, who said in mid-January that once the vaccine will be available and he is eligible, he will avail himself of it. He will also have his elderly mother get vaccinated if possible. Austriaco then suggested that local officials and priests have themselves vaccinated on television. Not a bad idea for influencers and leaders to have it on Facebook Live or on television.Pope Francis and Pope emeritus Benedict XVI have both received their second and final dose of the vaccine. Church sites in Manila and a Catholic school in Davao are being offered as vaccination sites. These are examples of how the Church is doing its part in the effort to allay fears.Austriaco became emotional when he said he hoped people will allow themselves to be inoculated because the vaccine is there to help them. He said side effects are normal for some people and the few who died could have been because of their other medical conditions.For those who do not want the vaccine, the message is this: If you do not want to get vaccinated, think of the people around you who can be infected if you have the virus. To protect them, get the vaccine so you do not spread the virus.I’m not a social media influencer, but I would like to have my vaccine as soon as possible, or as I become eligible, to protect myself and others.* * * Read the four-part special report by Marites V.

The two others are the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City and the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City.\n",
      "As of Monday, Vergeire said most of these 34 hospitals have submitted their verified lists of priority recipients as well as quick substitution lists.“Meron lang pong mga hospital na yung kanilang quick substitution list ay hindi pa po kumpleto, kaya kino-kumpleto lang sa ngayon (Some hospitals are still completing their quick subsitution lists),” Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is administered in two doses 28 days apart to persons who are at least 16 years old but not more than 80 years old. It is covered by an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the Philippines.\n",
      "The Philippines expects to receive 117,000 doses of this vaccine within February through the Covax facility, a mechanism that ensures global vaccine equity.Among the hospitals in Metro Manila that will receive the vaccine are the University of the Philippines (UP) Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines and Jose Rodriguez Memorial Hospital.The Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNitag) earlier said the following allocation framework will be followed in the distribution of the Pfizer vaccines:\n",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Norwegian officials have adjusted their advice on who gets the Covid-19 vaccine in light of reported deaths in older people, leaving it up to each doctor to consider who should be vaccinated.The Norwegian Medicines Agency on Thursday, January 14, 2021, reported that 29 people had suffered side effects, 13 of them fatal, after they were inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine.\n",
      "All the deaths occurred among patients in nursing homes and all were over the age of 80.The agency listed fever and nausea as side effects which “may have led to the deaths of some frail patients,” Sigurd Hortemo of the Norwegian Medicines Agency said in the body’s first report of the side effects.More than 30,000 people have received the first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna coronavirus vaccine in the Scandinavian country since the end of December, according to official figures.\n",
      "“We are not alarmed by this. It is quite clear that these vaccines have very little risk, with a small exception for the frailest patients,” Steinar Madsen, medical director with the agency, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.“Doctors must now carefully consider who should be vaccinated. Those who are very frail and at the very end of life can be vaccinated after an individual assessment,” he added.Earlier this week, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said that “any side effects of the vaccine will be outweighed by a reduced risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 for elderly, frail people.”It added that “for very frail patients and terminally ill patients, a careful balance of benefit versus disadvantage of vaccination is recommended.”In its report, the Norwegian Medicines Agency said that 21 women and eight men had side effects.Beside those who died, the agency said nine had serious side effects without a fatal consequence and seven had less serious side effects.\n",
      "The nine patients had allergic reactions, strong discomfort and severe fever while the less serious side effects included severe pain at the injection site.Overall, Norway has seen 57,279 cases and reported 511 deaths.Across the world, officials expect deaths and other severe side effects to be reported after any mass vaccination campaign given the huge numbers of people involved. But determining whether or not the vaccine caused deaths can be very challenging and requires that all other potential causes be ruled out first.The United Kingdom and the United States have also reported a number of cases of side effects that had fatal consequences.The European Medicines Agency said Friday that it will receive and consider monthly safety reports from companies authorized to sell vaccines, starting in January with the Pfizer jab.

She assured the public that they will hasten this.\n",
      "Loreche said there is a need to assess the region’s storage capabilities and they are doing inventory on the number of freezers that have a 220-degree capacity and those ultra-low freezers that have -70 degrees.“We will try to act fast on this so that when the vaccines are ready, we have a place for them,” she said.She said there are institutions in the region that have these capacities including some molecular laboratories and pharmaceuticals, but she cannot divulge specifics yet pending negotiations.\n",

      "WASHINGTON -- By the thousands, US service members are refusing or putting off the Covid-19 vaccine as frustrated commanders scramble to knock down internet rumors and find the right pitch that will persuade troops to get the shot.Some Army units are seeing as few as one-third agree to the vaccine. Military leaders searching for answers believe they have identified one potential convincer: an imminent deployment. Navy sailors on ships heading out to sea last week, for example, were choosing to take the shot at rates exceeding 80 percent to 90 percent.\n",
      "Air Force Major General Jeff Taliaferro, vice director of operations for the Joint Staff, told Congress on Wednesday that \"very early data\" suggests that just up to two-thirds of the service members offered the vaccine have accepted.That's higher than the rate for the general population, which a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation put at roughly 50 percent. But the significant number of forces declining the vaccine is especially worrisome because troops often live, work and fight closely together in environments where social distancing and wearing masks, at times, are difficult.The military's resistance also comes as troops are deploying to administer shots at vaccination centers around the country and as leaders look to American forces to set an example for the nation.\n",
      "\"We're still struggling with what is the messaging and how do we influence people to opt in for the vaccine,\" said Brigadier General Edward Bailey, the surgeon for Army Forces Command. He said that in some units just 30 percent have agreed to take the vaccine, while others are between 50 percent and 70 percent. Forces Command oversees major Army units, encompassing about 750,000 Army, Reserve and National Guard soldiers at 15 bases.At Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where several thousand troops are preparing for future deployments, the vaccine acceptance rate is about 60 percent, Bailey said. That's \"not as high as we would hope for front-line personnel,\" he said.Bailey has heard all the excuses.\"I think the most amusing one I heard was, 'The Army always tells me what to do, they gave me a choice, so I said no',\" he said.Service leaders have vigorously campaigned for the vaccine. They have held town halls, written messages to the force, distributed scientific data, posted videos, and even put out photos of leaders getting vaccinated.For weeks, the Pentagon insisted it did not know how many troops were declining the vaccine. On Wednesday, they provided few details on their early data.\n",
      "Officials from individual military services, however, said in interviews with The Associated Press that refusal rates vary widely, depending on a service member's age, unit, location, deployment status and other intangibles.The variations make it harder for leaders to identify which arguments for the vaccine are most persuasive. The Food and Drug Administration has allowed emergency use of the vaccine, so it's voluntary. But Defense Department officials say they hope that soon may change.\"We cannot make it mandatory yet,\" Vice Adm. Andrew Lewis, commander of the Navy's 2nd Fleet, said last week. \"I can tell you we're probably going to make it mandatory as soon as we can, just like we do with the flu vaccine.\"About 40 Marines gathered recently in a California conference room for an information session from medical staff. One officer, who was not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Marines are more comfortable posing questions about the vaccine in smaller groups.The officer said one Marine, citing a widely circulated and false conspiracy theory, said: \"I heard that this thing is actually a tracking device.\" The medical staff, said the officer, quickly debunked that theory, and pointed to the Marine's cellphone, noting that it's an effective tracker.Other frequent questions revolved around possible side effects or health concerns, including for pregnant women. Army, Navy and Air Force officials say they hear much the same.The Marine Corps is a relatively small service and troops are generally younger. Similar to the general population, younger service members are more likely to decline or ask to wait. In many cases, military commanders said, younger troops say they have had the coronavirus or known others who had it, and concluded it was not bad.\"What they're not seeing is that 20-year-olds who've actually gotten very sick, have been hospitalized or die, or the folks who appear to be fine but then it turns out they've developed pulmonary and cardiac abnormalities,\" Bailey said.One ray of hope has been deployments.Lewis, based in Norfolk, Virginia, said last week that sailors on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which is operating in the Atlantic, agreed to get the shot at a rate of about 80 percent. Sailors on the USS Iwo Jima and Marines in the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, who also are deploying, had rates of more than 90 percent.Bailey said the Army is seeing opportunities to reduce the two-week quarantine period for units deploying to Europe if service members are largely vaccinated and the host nation agrees. US Army Europe may cut the quarantine time to five days if 70 percent of the unit is vaccinated, and that incentive could work, he said.The acceptance numbers drop off among those who are not deploying, military officials said.General James McConville, the Army's chief of staff, used his own experience to encourage troops to be vaccinated. \"When they asked me how it felt, I said it was a lot less painful than some of the meetings I go to in the Pentagon.\"Colonel Jody Dugai, commander of the Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital at Fort Polk, Louisiana, said that so far conversations at the squad level, with eight to 10 peers, have been successful, and that getting more information helps.At the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Brigadier General David Doyle, has a dual challenge. As base commander, he must persuade the nearly 7,500 soldiers on base to get the shot and he needs to ensure that the thousands of troops that cycle in and out for training exercises are safe.Doyle said the acceptance rate on his base is between 30 percent and 40 percent, and that most often it's the younger troops who decline.\"They tell me they don't have high confidence in the vaccine because they believe it was done too quickly,\" he said. Top health officials have attested to the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine.Doyle said it appears peers are often more influential than leaders in persuading troops - a sentiment echoed by Bailey, the Army Forces Command surgeon.\"We're trying to figure out who the influencers are,\" Bailey said. \"Is it a squad leader or platoon sergeant in the Army? I think it probably is. Someone who is more of their age and interacts with them more on a regular basis versus the general officer who takes his picture and says, 'I got the shot.'\" (AP)\n"

      "HEALTH officials on Tuesday, December 29, 2020, said the people who imported and distributed the unregistered Sinopharm vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) will face sanctions.Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the sale, distribution or supply of a product that is not registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) violate Republic Act 9711.\n",
      "\"Those who brought in this vaccine, those who have supplied or distributed, and even the manufacturer may be sanctioned if they are used by our population without the proper processing by our regulatory agency, which is FDA,” Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing on Tuesday.Asked whether President Rodrigo Duterte or the AFP leadership could be held liable, Vergeire and FDA Director General Enrique Domingo refused to speculate.\"We don't know if the President was really the one that gave the order to vaccinate them. We are still waiting for the full details. We still have no information on what tranpired,\" Vergeire said.\n",
      "\"Until I get more data, I do not want to speculate on any liabilities. I want to see the details first,\" said Domingo.The FDA has not issued any Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of a vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the Philippines.However, many citizens and soldiers have been inoculated with the Sinopharm vaccine, President Duterte said during a meeting with Cabinet members and infectious diseases specialists on December 26.The Armed Forces of the Philippines later confirmed that members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) were among those who received the vaccine.Domingo earlier said he has ordered an investigation to determine the source of the vaccine.\"Our investigation, we are zeroing in on the importation and distribution of these unregistered vaccines,\" said Domingo.\"In this case, nothing passed through us, we had no information about it,\" he added.Section 11 of RA 9711 prohibits the manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, non-consumer use, promotion, advertising, or sponsorship of any health product that is adulterated, unregistered or misbranded.Sinopharm refers to the state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation.Meanwhile, Vergeire and Domingo advised those who received the unregistered vaccines to closely monitor their health and be on the lookout for adverse effects.\"We advise them that, if ever there are adverse effects, we have an existing protocol for such events,\" said Vergeire.\"They have to immediately consult with their doctors or they can go to the hospital and these hospitals would know how to manage that,\" Domingo added.

      "“The Australian government has committed half a billion dollars to Southeast Asia, a proportion of which is also coming to the Philippines. This is for the purchase of vaccines but also for the provision of technical assistance in the rolling out of vaccines,” Robinson said in an interview on Friday during his two-day visit in Cebu.He said Cebu is very important in the vaccine distribution, being the second largest city in the Philippines.Robinson said he is pushing to establish more economic opportunities beneficial for the two countries.\n",
      "“We have a development assistance program which is worth about AUD82 million (P3.02 billion) every year. Much is focused on the Visayas and Mindanao but because of the pandemic, we decided to reorient that development assistance program to focus on three things: health, prosperity and security in Mindanao, and economic recovery,” he said.He said they’re focused on the recovery programs so all of their assistance programs are being channeled to consistently help the national government’s objectives.Robinson said he is set to meet the country’s top officials tasked in the Covid-19 response to talk about Australian assistance.“It (funds) goes to the provisions of vaccines, which is the critical issue for the Philippines, and the inoculation program. Because the country has such a diverse geographical spread, more than 7,000 islands so you’ve got to move the vaccines to ensure everyone is vaccinated and then there’s an education campaign to try to get people to accept the vaccine,” the Aussie envoy said.\n",

      "AT LEAST 116,000 healthcare workers in the National Capital Region (NCR) are now entered in the master list for the anti-coronavirus vaccination program, according to the Department of Health (DOH).In a virtual press briefing, DOH - Covid-19 Surveillance and Quick Action Unit deputy chief Razel Nikka Hao said the list still has to be finalized as the hospitals are not done profiling their personnel.\n",
      "\"The hospitals are still going through the process of going through each of their staff, who have comorbidities or who have exclusions,\" said Hao.DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said it is necessary to complete the master list in Metro Manila because the healthcare workers there are first in the prioritization list of vaccine recipients.\"Based on the criteria, the burden of disease finds the NCR as the topmost. It is the number one in cases, that's why it was identified as priority,\" said Vergeire.\n",
      "\"Also, in the criteria of readiness in storage capacity being fulfilled, it would be the NCR that is most ready for this kind of vaccine,\" she furthered.Healthcare workers are at the top of the priority list.Substitution listWith some vaccine beneficiaries possibly backing out, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III urged local government units (LGUs) to also come up with a list of substitute recipients.According to Duque, having a quick substitution list (QSL) would minimize or avoid vaccine wastage.\"We have a shortage (of vaccines) so we have to be very careful that the vaccines aren't wasted,\" said Duque.\n",
      "As for returning overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), Vergeire said only those who have yet to get immunized shall be entitled to receive the vaccine in the country.OFWs are included in the priority list, considering they frequently travel.\"If they have already been immunized abroad, they won't be inoculated again. We will just be monitoring them,\" said Vergeire.\"Since OFWs are the ones going in and out of the country to work, then they are part of our priorities,\" said Vergeire.

      "MOSCOW -- Russia on Tuesday, August 11, became the first country to approve a coronavirus vaccine, a move that was met with international skepticism and unease because the shots have only been studied in dozens of people.President Vladimir Putin announced the Health Ministry's approval and said one of his two adult daughters already was inoculated. He said the vaccine underwent the necessary tests and was shown to provide lasting immunity to the coronavirus, although Russian authorities have offered no proof to back up claims of safety or effectiveness.\n",
      "\"I know it has proven efficient and forms a stable immunity,\" Putin said. \"We must be grateful to those who made that first step very important for our country and the entire world.\"However, scientists in Russia and other countries sounded an alarm, saying that rushing to offer the vaccine before final-stage testing could backfire. What's called a Phase 3 trial - which involves tens of thousands of people and can take months - is the only way to prove if an experimental vaccine is safe and really works.By comparison, vaccines entering final-stage testing in the US require studies of 30,000 people each. Two vaccine candidates already have begun those huge studies, with three more set to get underway by fall.\"Fast-tracked approval will not make Russia the leader in the race, it will just expose consumers of the vaccine to unnecessary danger,\" said Russia's Association of Clinical Trials Organizations, in urging government officials to postpone approving the vaccine without completed advanced trials.While Russian officials have said large-scale production of the vaccine wasn't scheduled until September, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said vaccination of doctors could start as early as this month. Officials say they will be closely monitored after the injections. Mass vaccination may begin as early as October.\"We expect tens of thousands of volunteers to be vaccinated within the next months,\" Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund that bankrolled the vaccine, told reporters.The vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow with assistance from Russia's Defense Ministry uses a different virus -- the common cold-causing adenovirus -- that's been modified to carry genes for the \"spike\" protein that coats the coronavirus, as a way to prime the body to recognize if a real Covid-19 infection comes along.That's a similar technology as vaccines being developed by China's CanSino Biologics and Britain's Oxford University and AstraZeneca - but unlike those companies, Russian scientists haven't published any scientific information about how the vaccine has performed in animal tests or in early-stage human studies.Dmitriev said even as Russian doctors and teachers start getting vaccinated, advanced trials are set to start Wednesday that will involve \"several thousand people\" and span several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and possibly Brazil.The Associated Press couldn't find documentation in the Russian Health Ministry's records indicating that permission to start the advanced trials was granted. The ministry has not responded to a request for comment.Putin said one of his daughters has received two doses, and had minor side effects such as slight fever, and is now \"feeling well and has a high number of antibodies.\" It wasn't clear if she was one of the study volunteers.The Health Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the vaccine is expected to provide immunity from the coronavirus for up to two years, citing its experience with vaccines made with similar technology.However, scientists around the world have been cautioning that even if vaccine candidates are proven to work, it will take even more time to tell how long the protection will last.\"The collateral damage from release of any vaccine that was less than safe and effective would exacerbate our current problems insurmountably,\" Imperial College London immunology professor Danny Altmann said in a statement Tuesday.The World Health Organization has urged that all vaccine candidates go through full stages of testing before being rolled out, and said Tuesday it is in touch with the Russian scientists and \"looks forward to reviewing\" Russia's study data. Experts have warned that vaccines that are not properly tested can cause harm in many ways - from harming health to creating a false sense of security or undermining trust in vaccinations.Becoming the first country in the world to approve a vaccine was a matter of national prestige for the Kremlin as it tries to assert the image of Russia as a global power. Putin repeatedly praised Russia's effective response to the outbreak in televised addresses to the nation, while some of Moscow's top officials - including the country's prime minister and Putin's own spokesperson - became infected.And the US, Britain and Canada last month accused Russia of using hackers to steal vaccine research from Western labs. Russia has denied involvement.Russia has so far registered 897,599 coronavirus cases, including 15,131 deaths.The Gamaleya Institute's director, Alexander Gintsburg, raised eyebrows in May when he said that he and other researchers tried the vaccine on themselves before the start of human studies.Those trials started June 17 with 76 volunteers. Half were injected with a vaccine in liquid form and the other half with a vaccine that came as soluble powder. Some in the first group were recruited from the military, which raised concerns that servicemen may have been pressured to participate. The test was declared completed earlier this month.\"It's a too early stage to truly assess whether it's going to be effective, whether it's going to work or not,\" said Dr. Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at England's University of Southampton.It's not Russia's first controversial vaccine. Putin has bragged that Russian scientists delivered an Ebola vaccine that \"proved to be the most effective in the world\" and \"made a real contribution to fighting the Ebola fever in Africa.\" However, there is little evidence either of the two Ebola vaccines approved in Russia was widely used in Africa. As of 2019, both of those vaccines were listed by the WHO as \"candidate vaccines.\" (AP)\n"

      "NEW DELHI -- India has started shipping Covid-19 vaccines to multiple cities, four days ahead of a nationwide inoculation drive.The first consignment of vaccines developed by the Serum Institute of India left the city of Pune on Tuesday. The vaccines rolled out from Serum Institute of India’s facility in temperature-controlled trucks to the city’s airport, from where they were loaded into private air carriers for distribution all over the country.Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri called the shipping of vaccines a “momentous mission.”Beginning Saturday, India will start the massive undertaking of inoculating an estimated 30 million doctors, nurses and other front-line workers. The effort will then turn to inoculating around 270 million people who are either older than 50 or have secondary health conditions that raise their risks of dying from Covid-19.The first vaccine shipments contain the Covishield vaccine made by the Serum Institute and developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.India's drug regulator has also approved for emergency use a homegrown vaccine, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Medical groups and others have raised concern about the drug being approved with scant evidence of its effectiveness. It’s still unclear when and where Covaxin will be distributed.India has the second-most Covid-19 infections in the world, after the US. It has confirmed more than 10.4 million cases and over 150,000 deaths. (AP)\n",

No problem,” Duque said in a television interview.“I will take it as long as it has undergone scientific evaluation by the Department of Science and Technology’s Vaccine Experts Panel, the Ethics Board Review and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) which will conduct its own regulatory assessment,\" he added.Duque made the statement in response to the challenge made by Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go that Duque and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. be the first to try the vaccine before it is administered to others.Duque also encouraged his fellow Cabinet members to volunteer and receive the vaccine first.Duque said the Covid vaccination program might start in March or April 2021.\"We’ve done some scenario analysis under the leadership of Sec. (Carlito Jr) Galvez and I think the best case scenario would be about the end of the first quarter of 2021 or about the start of second quarter of next year,\" he said.\"A lot of factors will have to be taken into consideration to be able to more definitively set schedules for actual distribution, deployment, and inoculation of our people within our priority list,\" he added.The Philippines has received five applications for clinical trials for vaccines against Covid-19. These are from Sinovac, Gamaleya, AstraZeneca, Janssen and Clover.Meanwhile, Department of Science and Technology’s VEP head Nina Gloriani said the World Health Organization solidarity trial for Covid-19 vaccines in the Philippines might begin in January and may be needed to be participated by 10,000 to 15,000 people.\"Meron tayong pinaghahandaan na 4,000 participants pero baka madagdagan pa ito hanggang 10,000-15,000.

      "CATHAY Pacific Cargo has built on its many years of experience in transporting pharmaceutical shipments to develop a vaccine solution specifically for the fast and effective distribution of Covid-19 vaccines across the globe.Cathay Pacific Director Cargo Tom Owen said: \"With our 20 dedicated freighters and cargo bellies of passenger aircraft supporting our extensive freighter network, we stand ready to assist with what will be the biggest humanitarian response to a situation involving civil aviation that anyone has ever seen.\"Ultra TrackCathay Pacific Cargo is progressively rolling out Ultra Track as a key part of the vaccine solution. The next-generation track-and-trace system monitors information including temperature, GPS location, and humidity, using low-energy Bluetooth readers. This gives shippers and forwarders near real time visibility, and ensures vaccines will remain within their transportation temperature ranges.Operations Control CentreIn addition, shipments using Ultra Track will also be monitored by the newly established Operations Control Centre. Based in Hong Kong, and staffed by dedicated cargo professionals 24/7, the team can instruct ramp and cargo terminal staff to take proactive steps to ensure the various storage requirements of vaccines are maintained.Owen said: \"Ultra Track will allow forwarders to monitor the condition of their vaccine shipments in near real time. It will be progressively rolled out through the first quarter of this year, and we will be offering the service free of charge for any Covid-19 vaccine shipments.\"CEIV Pharma accreditationThe combined approach follows on from an airport-wide recertification of IATA's CEIV Pharma accreditation (the internationally recognized quality-assurance scheme for pharmaceutical shipments) at Hong Kong International Airport. Cathay Pacific Cargo, the Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal managed by Cathay Pacific Services Limited (CPSL) and ground-handling subsidiary Hong Kong Airport Services (HAS) have all been re-certified, offering a complete level of quality assurance at every stage of the import and transhipment journey.Airport Authority Hong Kong General Manager Aviation Logistics Alaina Shum said: \"Hong Kong International Airport advocates and supports the airport community in its CEIV Pharma recertification, which helps to cement its status as the world's leading and busiest cargo airport.\"The Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal is being expanded to offer more temperature-controlled capacity. While it is currently able to temporarily hold and transit 6.6 million doses of vaccine a day, there is more to come.Cathay Pacific Cargo's Owen says: \"We have just expanded so that it can handle more than seven million doses, and there will be more cold storage coming online soon. This new cold room storage will be able to handle a further 1.6 million doses.\"\"With the vaccine being so valuable and in such limited supply, it's critical that we get it right at every stage of the journey. We are confident about meeting the challenge, and we stand ready to play our part,\" Owen added.To read more about Cathay Pacific Cargo's vaccine-handling capabilities, click here. (PR)\n"
