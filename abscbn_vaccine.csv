MAYNILA - Inirekomenda ng isang dating health chief na unahing mabigyan ng AstraZeneca vaccines ang mga health frontliner na nasa edad 60 pataas.Ito ay matapos dumating sa bansa ang 487,200 doses ng AstraZeneca vaccines na ipinangako ng COVAX facility ng World Health Organization (COVAX).Ayon kay dating health secretary Esperanza Cabral, lantad sa virus ang mga senior na frontliner, pero hindi pa sila nababakunahan dahil hindi inirerekomenda sa mga may edad 60 pataas ang Sinovac vaccines mula China na unang dumating sa bansa.Marami rin aniyang health worker ang edad 60 pataas lalo na sa gobyerno, na 65 years ang retirement age.“’Yung AstraZeneca vaccine, walang age limit, walang upper age limit. So puwedeng gamitin iyan doon sa mga over 60 years old. Marami pang frontliners na over 60 years old,” ani Cabral sa panayam sa TeleRadyo.Gabi ng Huwebes nang dumating ang suplay ng AstraZeneca vaccines sa Pilipinas mula sa vaccine-sharing platform COVAX facility, matapos ilang beses na maantala ang pagdating nito dahil sa isyu ng indemnity o bayad-pinsala.Watch more in iWantTFC
Noong Lunes sinimulan ng gobyerno ang vaccine rollout, kung saan inuna ang health workers matapos dumating ang Sinovac vaccines mula China.Inirekomenda ang nasabing bakuna sa mga taong may karamdaman gaya ng obesity, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, at diabetes. Maaari rin itong gamitin sa mga gumaling kontra COVID-19.Pero bawal itong gamitin sa mga may allergic reaction at mga may edad 18 pababa. May mga inaasahan ding side effects gaya ng kirot sa naturukang bahagi, pagkahapo, pananakit ng kalamnan, sakit sa ulo, at panginginig o chills.May iba pang malalang epekto tulad ng anemia, pamamaga, myelitis, at mataas na lagnat.READ: What to expect after getting a COVID-19 vaccine

MANILA - The Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific said their planes were helping transport COVID-19 vaccines to different cities in the country, as government's inoculation drive has begun.
Philippine Airlines spokesperson Cielo Villaluna said Thursday the flag carrier has flown thousands of doses of the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine to different parts of the country.Some 17,400 doses of Sinovac vaccines have been shipped to Cagayan de Oro, 21,600 doses to Davao, 12,000 doses to Legazpi and 4,200 doses to Cotabato City, as of 10:35 a.m. on March 4.""Philippine Airlines is proud to be part of this mission of bringing the vaccines to various parts of the country as a first step towards healing and recovery,"" Villaluna said in a Facebook post.
Cebu Pacific on Friday said its unit CebGo carried doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Zamboanga and Tuguegarao.
Zamboanga received 17 boxes, while 28 boxes were transported to Tuguegarao, the carrier said.
“As a public service with the widest domestic network, we will do all we can to help ensure the timely and successful distribution of vaccines across the country, as we all work together to pave way for the recovery of our economy,” said CEBGo president and CEO Alex Reyes.
Cebu Pacific said it has flown a total 21,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines.
Private firms have been instrumental in increasing the testing and isolation capacity of the country when the pandemic started last year.Tycoon Manny Pangilinan earlier said Metro Pacific Investment Corp through its logistics arm has ""taken the initiative"" to store batches of China's COVID-19 vaccine Sinovac in its facility.This year, private firms have committed to help in procuring, transporting and storing the vaccines.

Ana Hospital administer the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac to fellow frontliners from different hospitals in Manila on March 2, 2021. George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News
BEIJING - Sinovac Biotech's COVID-19 vaccine may not trigger sufficient antibody responses against a new variant identified in Brazil, a small-sample lab study showed.
The emergence of variants of the new coronavirus has raised concern that vaccines and treatments that were developed based on previous strains may not work as robustly.
Plasma samples taken from eight people vaccinated with Sinovac's CoronaVac failed to efficiently neutralize the P.1 lineage variant, or 20J/501Y.V3, researchers said in a paper published on Monday ahead of peer-review.
""These results suggest that P.1 virus might escape from neutralizing antibodies induced by... CoronaVac,"" researchers at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, Washington University School of Medicine in the United States, and a few other institutions said in the paper.

Although the study suggests re-infection may occur in vaccinated individuals, the protection given by CoronaVac against severe COVID-19 may indicate other mechanisms in the human immune system, aside from antibodies, may also contribute to reducing disease severity, researchers said.
A Sinovac spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Chief executive Yin Weidong said in a programme aired by state-backed broadcaster CGTN on Thursday the company is ""fully capable"" of using current research and manufacturing capacity to develop a new vaccine against variants if necessary.
He also said the process would take much less time than it took to develop CoronaVac. "

AFP
A Cuban-developed coronavirus candidate vaccine entered into Phase III trials Thursday, the first shot developed by a Latin American country to get this far, the government said.
The recruitment of 44,000 volunteers aged 19 to 80 to test the drug named Soberana 2 has already begun, said Cuba's Finlay vaccine institute.
The first trial shots should start being administered in Havana next week.
The trial volunteers will be divided into three groups: some will receive two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart, another group will get two doses plus a third immune booster, and the third a placebo.
This third phase of the trial will officially end three months after the last dose is injected, the institute's Yury Valdes told reporters.
But if the results are promising, authorization for emergency use could be sought before then.
The communist state, which has stated it wants to vaccinate all inhabitants this year, has been relatively unscathed by the Covid-19 pandemic, with just over 53,300 recorded cases and 336 deaths in a population of 11.2 million.
Under American sanctions, the island nation began developing its own vaccines in the 1980s, discovering the first immunization against the meningitis-causing Meningococcal B bacteria.
Nearly 80 percent of its vaccines are produced locally, and Cuba is working on four coronavirus candidate vaccines.
Soberana 2, like Novavax developed in America, is a recombinant protein vaccine.
They work by recreating the ""spikes"" on the surface of the coronavirus and introducing it to the body, training the immune system to recognize such intruders and fight back in case of a real infection.
Recombinant vaccines, unlike some coronavirus shots already in use, do not need extreme refrigeration.

ABUJA - A doctor who has spent the past year treating COVID-19 patients on Friday became the first person in Nigeria to be vaccinated against the disease, kicking off a mammoth campaign that aims to inoculate 80 million people this year.
Vaccinating all of Nigeria's 200 million people and those in other developing countries is seen as key to stemming the global spread of the coronavirus.
""I am happy to be the first and I am happy I am not the last,"" the doctor, 42-year-old Ngong Cyprian, told Reuters. ""I want everybody to be vaccinated.""
Two other male doctors and one female nurse were also inoculated in white tents draped in green, the colors of the national flag, while cameras rolled and officials clapped and cheered.
Nigeria, with 157,671 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,951 deaths, has not been as hard hit by the pandemic as initially feared, but is aiming to vaccinate 40% of its people this year, and a further 30% in 2022.
It took delivery of 3.92 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine on Tuesday through the COVAX scheme. Nigeria expects to receive 84 million doses of the vaccine from COVAX this year.
The scheme for poor and middle-income countries is co-led by Gavi, the vaccine alliance, and the World Health Organization, with UNICEF as an implementing partner.

Nigeria also expects at least 40 million doses from the African Union and 100,000 donated doses of India's Covishield vaccine.
President Muhammadu Buhari and other ""strategic leaders"" will be vaccinated on Saturday in an effort to increase public confidence in the shots.

MANILA—The Philippines' vaccine czar on Friday said all COVID-19 vaccines to be delivered to the country will be ""specifically allocated"" to healthcare workers.
""Initial deliveries for April will also follow this allocation until we have completely inoculated nearly 2 million individuals under this sector,"" national COVID-19 task force chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. said in a statement.
Galvez explained that due to the limited supply of vaccines and recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), along with the directive of President Rodrigo Duterte, the allocation of COVID-19 jabs should follow the priority framework issued by the country's inter-agency task force focused on the coronavirus response.
""The framework prioritizes medical frontliners and healthcare workers to be followed by our senior citizens and other sectors. This prioritization primarily ensures that we will be able to protect and preserve our healthcare system as we continue to battle this pandemic,"" he said.
According to Galvez, the prioritization of healthcare workers was emphasized by the World Health Organization as part of the Philippines' agreement in procuring 44 million doses of COVID-19 shots from the COVAX Facility, an initiative focused to provide equitable access to vaccines and which the agency is a leader of.

""All the doses from COVAX must first be administered to the agreed upon priority groups starting with healthcare workers. Giving the vaccines to other sectors when not all healthcare workers have been vaccinated will jeopardize succeeding deliveries from COVAX,"" he stressed.
The Philippines on Thursday received 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX Facility, a boost in its immunization drive following the arrival of Chinese vaccine CoronaVac on Sunday.
WHO country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the Philippines should expect another 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca jabs to arrive in May through the same vaccine-sharing platform.

MANILA - The initial batch of around 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine secured for private sector's use is expected to arrive by the second quarter, a presidential adviser said Friday.Sec. Joey Concepcion, founder of Go Negosyo and Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship, said the first batch of vaccines for 23 companies may arrive by May or June. The remaining balance will arrive around the third quarter.
“Kalahati nun dinonate namin sa national government para sa mga medical frontliners,” said Concepcion.

(We're ordering now and the distributor is Faberco and Unilab. It will arrive by the third quarter.)
He said the national government and the local government units have placed around 30 million to 40 million doses.For the private sector, he said they have already ordered close to 1 million doses.
“Maraming companies are ordering but smaller quantities. These are small and medium size companies halos 400 companies. Dito sa Moderna at Novavax hindi na kailangang mag donate sa government ng vaccines,” he said.
(For Moderna and Novavax, we don't have to donate vaccines to government.)

(That's free but the employee can buy for his family from the company.)
He clarified that this is not mandatory as families have the option to wait for the free supply of vaccines coming from their respective local government units.Some companies may extend the free vaccines to their employees’ immediate family while others could offer it through salary deduction.

One of the recipients was a 28-year-old female Sumatran orangutan named Karen who had garnered headlines at the zoo when she became the first ape to undergo open-heart surgery in 1994.
Each of the nine animals received two doses of an experimental vaccine originally designed for dogs and cats, with the apes exhibiting no adverse reactions, and are all doing well, zoo spokeswoman Darla Davis said in an email to Reuters.
Zoo officials went ahead with the shots over concerns about the animals' wellbeing after a troop of eight gorillas at the affiliated San Diego Zoo Safari Park fell ill with COVID-19 in January, marking the first known transmission of the virus to great apes.
Two gorillas at San Diego Zoo test positive for COVID-19
The eight gorillas, including a 48-year-old male ""silverback"" named Winston who suffered from pneumonia and heart disease, have since improved and appear to be on their way to a full recovery, Davis said.
Winston was treated with a variety of medications, including a coronavirus antibody therapy for non-humans.

The gorillas were not vaccinated because veterinarians assumed their immune systems had already developed antibodies to the virus. They were thought to have caught the illness from an asymptomatic staff member.
The orangutans and bonobos selected for immunization were among the great apes at the zoo considered the most at risk of catching the virus and among the easiest to inoculate. Staff vaccinated the animals by distracting them from the needle with treats.
Zoo staff began administering the shots to some of the animals in January and continued through February, with the last few given in March, Davis said.
The vaccine developed by veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis was not tested on apes. But cross-species use of vaccines is not uncommon, and apes at the zoo get human flu and measles vaccines, according to Nadine Lamberski, chief conservation and wildlife officer for the San Diego Wildlife Alliance, the entity that owns the zoo and safari park.
She said the nine great apes were the first non-human primates known to have received a COVID-19 vaccine of any kind.

Dr. Jose Rene De Grano, president of the Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines Inc, said many employees in private hospitals initially expressed reservation about the Chinese-made vaccines.
At least 70 percent of employees in private hospitals earlier agreed to be vaccinated against the disease.

""Ang mga occupancy nasa (The occupancy is between) 30 to 40 percent,"" he said.
The Philippines launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on Monday using CoronaVac, which were donated by China.

Isa ang Pilipinas sa makakatanggap sa pinakamalaking supply ng bakuna kontra COVID-19 mula sa COVAX Facility, sabi ngayong Huwebes ng World Health Organization (WHO).
Layon ng COVAX Facility ng WHO na mabigyan ng bakuna ang lahat ng nangangailangang bansa. Libre ang karamihan sa mga bakunang makukuha ng Pilipinas mula rito.
""So we had some initial problems with setting up the mechanisms and the deliveries. We are happy to note that Philippines is receiving one of the largest consignment of COVAX vaccines. In this first initial consignment, [there's] 487,000 doses,"" ani WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe.
Nakatakdang dumating sa Pilipinas ngayong gabi ng Huwebes ang 487,000 doses ng COVID-19 vaccine ng AstraZeneca mula sa COVAX.
""We have already commitment from the COVAX Facility for delivery of up to 4.58 million AstraZeneca vaccines through to March, to May of this year,"" ani Abeyasinghe.
Wala pang petsa kung kailan darating ang mga dagdag na bakuna ng AstraZeneca ngunit maramihan ang pagdating nito.
Mahalaga umanong hindi masayang ang mga bakuna at maibigay sa mga priority sector, lalong-lalo na ang mga health worker.
""We need to acknowledge that possibly the largest sacrifice has been made by health care workers, not only by putting themselves at risk, but also their immediate families,"" sabi ni Abeyasinghe.
Ayon sa WHO, bagaman natatakot ang lahat na magka-COVID-19, sa pamamagitan ng pagbabakuna sa health workers ay masisigurado na may mag-aalaga sa mga pasyente.
Iginiit pa ng WHO na magkakaproblema sa access sa bakuna kung hindi masunod ang pag-prioritize sa health workers.
""If we cannot demonstrate that we are following this prioritization, unfortunately, the COVAX may have to consider other options where the impact of the vaccine rollout will be more useful and practical and will contribute to saving more lives,"" ani Abeyasinghe.
Hindi malinaw kung ititigil ba ng COVAX ang pagbibigay ng bakuna kung hindi masunod anng prioritization.
Ang sinabi lang ng WHO ay dapat sundin ang itatakda ng DOH at National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG).
Pinag-uusapan pa ngayon ang prioritization para sa AstraZeneca vaccines, ayon sa DOH.
Kinumpirma naman ng DOH na maaaring ibigay ang AstraZeneca vaccines sa senior citizens at mga may comorbidities o pre-existing na sakit pero dadaan pa rin sa NITAG kung pang-ilan ang mga ito sa prioritization.

MANILA — More than 400,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccines arrived in the Philippines on Thursday evening, making it the 2nd COVID-19 vaccine brand to be distributed in the country. Here’s what you need to know about AstraZeneca’s vaccine:
EFFICACY
The COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S[recombinant]) or AZD1222 vaccine was developed by the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and the Oxford University.
It has an efficacy rate of 63.09% against symptomatic COVID-19 infection, according to the World Health Organization, which included AstraZeneca in its emergency use listing.
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration said it has an overall efficacy rate of 70% after the first dose and trials are ongoing to determine the efficacy rate after the 2nd dose.
PH approves AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use
The emergency use authorization document from the FDA states that it comes in two doses of 0.5 mL each, with the 2nd dose given between 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose.
Despite concerns that AstraZeneca’s vaccine like others is less effective against new variants, the WHO said its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) still recommends its use.
A WHO Philippines official said a study claiming that the AstraZeneca vaccine is only 10% effective against the South African variant has a very limited sample size and that it should not be a cause of concern for now since the country only has a few detected cases.
The official also pointed out that while no vaccine is proven to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, the priority now is to reduce severe cases and deaths, something that AstraZeneca is said to be able to do.
WHO says study on South African variant effect on AstraZeneca ‘very limited,’ deems COVID-19 vaccine still effective
AGE & PRIORITIZATION
Unlike Sinovac’s vaccine, AstraZeneca’s can be administered to the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions. However, it is not yet recommended to those below the age of 18.
Because it can be used on the elderly, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said senior health care workers will be prioritized in the first batch of AstraZeneca’s vaccines.The WHO emphasized that the AstraZeneca vaccines coming from the COVAX Facility, a vaccine-sharing initiative that aims for equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, should first be given to health workers. Otherwise, there may be access concerns.
“If we cannot demonstrate that we are following this prioritization, unfortunately, the COVAX may have to consider other options where the impact of the vaccine rollout will be more useful and practical and will contribute to saving more lives,” WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said on Thursday
Health workers should be priority for COVAX COVID-19 vaccines to be sent to PH— WHO
PLATFORM
The AstraZeneca is a viral vector vaccine, which uses a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) in chimpanzees to carry thegenetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. Once injected into the body, it allows the production of the spike protein, triggering an immune response that will train the body to fight the disease if the person is infected later on.This is different from Sinovac’s inactivated virus vaccine, which contains the killed SARS-CoV-2 virus, or Pfizer’s vaccine using the relatively new messenger RNA technology.Unlike mRNA vaccines that require ultra cold freezers, AstraZeneca can be kept in regular refrigerator temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. The EUA states that the vials should not be frozen. This makes AstraZeneca easier to transport to other parts of the country and to administer.
SUPPLY
Besides the 487,200 doses that arrived on Thursday, the WHO said the Philippines “is receiving one of the largest consignment of COVAX vaccines.”
From March to May, the Philippines is expected to receive 4.58 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccines.
WHO: PH to be among biggest recipients of COVAX vaccines, 4.5M AstraZeneca doses coming
This does not include the 17 million AstraZeneca doses secured through the government’s tripartite agreements with local government units and the private sector.

There is still no schedule as of posting time on when the next batches of AstraZeneca vaccines will arrive.Besides the United Kingdom, AstraZeneca’s vaccine is being used under limited or emergency authorization in countries in Europe, Argentina, Brazil, India, Malaysia, Mexico, and others.
Other COVID-19 vaccines allowed for emergency use in the Philippines are that of Pfizer and Sinovac

MANILA — The World Health Organization on Thursday said the Philippines will receive around 4.5 million of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccines until May this year from the COVAX Facility, with the country set to become one of the largest recipients of jabs through the global vaccine-sharing platform.WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe told reporters that an initial shipment of 487,000 doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines were expected to arrive on Thursday night.
“So we had some initial problems with setting up the mechanisms and the deliveries. We are happy to note that Philippines is receiving one of the largest consignment of COVAX vaccines. In this first initial consignment, [there's] 487,000 doses,” Abeyasinghe said.
Abeyasinghe said that for the AstraZeneca vaccine alone, the COVAX Facility, of which WHO is a member, will be sending 4.58 million doses to the Philippines from March to May.“And in addition to that, we will also be receiving 117,000 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Plus, the additional quantities of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that will be allocated will be known before the end of this month,” he said.

Abeyasinghe said they still do not have the exact schedule of the additional AstraZeneca shipments from COVAX but that they are expected to come in large batches from a manufacturing facility in South Korea.
“And so we need to have set up in the country the capacity to manage these large stocks of vaccines coming in, and also to ensure that the rollout is carried out, aligned to the prioritization that is expected from the COVAX to maximize the impact of the vaccine rollout,” he said.
The WHO official said the Philippines has to demonstrate that it could efficiently roll out the vaccines while minimizing wastage.Abeyasinghe talked at length about the importance of prioritizing health workers, especially because of the huge sacrifice the sector has made for the rest of the population.Pfizer’s vaccines from COVAX was supposed to arrive first in the Philippines but was delayed because of a pending indemnification agreement, under which government would cover costs in case those inoculated experience adverse effects.The Philippines received 600,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac on Sunday. The vaccines have been rolled out to health workers all over the country.

The COVAX Facility, of which WHO is a member, is a vaccine-sharing initiative that aims for equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.
While vaccines from China's Sinovac have already been used to inoculate health workers, WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the 487,000 AstraZeneca vaccines arriving in the Philippines Thursday evening and those expected to be delivered soon should be earmarked for those most at risk, such as health workers.

“We recognize that the last year has been challenging for everybody, but we need to acknowledge that possibly the largest sacrifice has been made by health care workers, not only by putting themselves at risk, but also their immediate families,” he said. “So it is our duty to provide protection to them.”
He explained that having health workers protected would ensure the efficient treatment of patients.Abeyasinghe said the “prioritization is not something that WHO is planning to police” but he did add, “If we want to ensure that we continue to access the vaccines from the COVAX facility, we need to demonstrate that we can follow this prioritization, we can offer protection to the most vulnerable, most at risk in a prioritized way.”
He emphasized the huge demand for vaccines in all countries and how everybody feels at risk, but that it’s “a matter of relative risk.”
As of March 1, a total of 14,874 health workers have been infected with COVID-19 in the Philippines, among whom 82 died. There are, meanwhile, 121 active cases.
Abeyasinghe refused to directly respond whether COVAX would stop sending vaccines to the Philippines if it does not prioritize health workers for vaccination.
But he said, “If we cannot demonstrate that we are following this prioritization, unfortunately, the COVAX may have to consider other options where the impact of the vaccine rollout will be more useful and practical and will contribute to saving more lives.”
He specifically pointed out that the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) already identified health workers as most at risk for COVID-19. He also urged everyone to “respect the prioritization” that will be determined by the Department of Health and the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) in consultation with them.DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they are meeting with NITAG on Thursday to discuss the allocation of the AstraZeneca vaccines.
Access to COVID-19 vaccines has long been a problem for the Philippines, which has lagged behind its neighbors in Asia in starting the rollout of vaccines.
Last year, there were reports that some officials and members of the Presidential Security Group received smuggled COVID-19 vaccines.Malacañang also recently revealed that the NITAG rejected the proposal of the Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19 response to allot coronavirus shots for ""influencers"" who might help boost the public's vaccine confidence.”

Dr. Beverly Ho, director of the DOH Health Promotion Bureau, also told media on Thursday morning that with the current segment of the population being prioritized for vaccination, it may be more helpful to have “health care worker influencers” vaccinated.She explained health workers are also more convinced with medical evidence and the decision of other health professionals to be vaccinated as in the case of the Sinovac roll-out.
The WHO said the Philippines will receive 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca's coronavirus jabs from March until May, becoming one of the largest recipients of vaccines through the COVAX facility.

MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte may reconsider authorizing a pilot test of face-to-face classes once the country has rolled out 2 million COVID-19 vaccines, a Malacañang official said on Thursday.
The country has so far vaccinated 8,559 individuals with COVID-19 shots from Beijing-based drug maker Sinovac Biotech, 600,000 doses of which were donated by China last Sunday. The Philippines is set to get later Thursday 487,200 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from Britain's AstraZeneca.
Duterte in a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday said he wanted a ""more rigorous, more widespread"" vaccination before allowing limited in-person classes, and a shift to the loosest lockdown level, the modified general community quarantine, said Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles.
“Ang sabi nga niya is that unless he sees about, he gave a figure like 2 million vaccines being rolled out as a start, then that’s when he will start reconsidering about itong pagbubukas, more openly ng ating GCQ, General Community Quarantine areas, to consider again putting it under modified GCQ, and doon sa limited face-to-face classes,” he said.Face-to-face classes, if allowed, will only be held in areas with low COVID-19 transmission rates, Nograles said in a televised press briefing.READ: Senate OKs resolution recommending resumption of face-to-face classes

When the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was first authorized by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, it was hailed as a milestone in turning the tide on the coronavirus.
But in the time since, this highly efficacious vaccine has suffered a lot of reputational damage. In January, the German press and French president Emmanuel Macron falsely claimed that it is largely ineffective in people over 65, despite there being no evidence to support this.
Philippines to get 487,000 AstraZeneca COVID-19 shots on Thursday
Yet concrete evidence on how protective the vaccine is in older people has been lacking, leading some European countries to restrict the vaccine to under-65s. Together, these factors appear to have created high levels of skepticism in Europe and low levels of uptake.
READ: FAST FACTS: What you need to know about the AstraZeneca vaccine
Thankfully, though, more information on how well the vaccine works is arriving all of the time – and seeing the vaccine’s positive effects, some countries are now reversing their restrictions on giving it to over-65s. Here’s what we know so far about the vaccine’s effects.
Trials suggested it’s a bit less protective than other vaccines. Pfizer’s, for example, prevented symptomatic disease 95 percent of the time in testing, whereas the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine did so 70 percent of the time.
READ: WHO says study on South African variant effect on AstraZeneca ‘very limited,’ deems COVID-19 vaccine still effective
But recent real-world data from the UK suggests that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine might actually be a bit better than Pfizer’s at preventing serious disease and hospitalization. However, these studies haven’t been set up to avoid outside biases affecting results.For example, the Pfizer vaccine was rolled out first, so might have been given disproportionately to more vulnerable people. Also, these studies are preprints, meaning they haven’t been checked by other scientists yet.
So whether the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is more or less effective than others at preventing COVID-19 isn’t clear yet. The important thing to remember is that all the authorized vaccines are safe and offer very good levels of protection against COVID-19. If you’re offered any vaccine, you should take it.
READ: Pfizer and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines 'highly effective' in elderly: UK study
An early stage of testing – a combined phase 1 and 2 trial – strongly suggested that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine would offer protection to older people. It showed the vaccine generated just as strong an immune response in older participants as younger ones.
However, as we don’t know to what extent different parts of the immune response act against the virus, this alone didn’t prove that the vaccine would be effective in this age group. And in the final phase of testing – phase 3 trials – which are designed to prove that a vaccine is protective, there weren’t enough people over 55 to give a reliable estimate of protection for this group.
Exactly how protective the vaccine is in older people remains uncertain. But a recent preprint suggests it works very well. A single shot of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine appears to reduce the chances of people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 by 80 percent after the first dose.
It depends on the variant. A preprint suggests that the vaccine may be as effective against B117, the variant that has arisen in the UK, as it was against the earlier forms of the coronavirus.
But against the variant circulating in South Africa, B1351, a preprint suggests it may be much less effective at preventing mild to moderate disease than it was against previous forms of the virus. It’s believed this is because of a mutation called E484K, which changes the virus’s exterior so that existing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are less able to bind to it.
Sarah Gilbert, lead researcher on the Oxford Vaccine Development Program, believes that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will still protect against severe disease when facing these variants. However, this has yet to be proven.
Variants circulating in New York (B1526) and Brazil (P1) also have this E484K mutation. We don’t yet have data on how well the vaccine works against these variants, but it’s plausible that it may struggle against them too.
In the meantime, the vaccine’s developers have confirmed that they can tweak it to handle these mutations. They estimate an updated booster could be ready by autumn.
You might experience some, but they shouldn’t be severe or last long. Common side-effects include a sore patch where the needle went into your arm, a temperature, aching, tiredness and feeling sick. These aren’t necessarily bad, because they’re a sign that your immune system has noticed the vaccine and is responding to it.
READ: What to expect after getting a COVID-19 vaccine
In France and Germany, reports of healthcare workers experiencing flu-like symptoms after receiving the vaccine – at rates of 40 percent of people or higher – have worried people. However, these effects were also seen in the vaccine’s combined phase 1 and 2 clinical trial. Researchers found that taking paracetamol helped, and that these effects had largely subsided after seven days.
The intervals between doses have been a bit controversial, since the 12-week gap that’s being left between them in the UK is different from the dosing schedule that was submitted for regulatory approval by the manufacturer.
However, it looks like delaying the second dose to 12 weeks after the first is actually a good idea. The protection from the first injection seems to last, and if you have the second vaccine 12 weeks later, rather than four weeks as originally proposed, that seems to generate a stronger immune response.

MANILA - About 300 workers of Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital in Manila have signed up to be inoculated against COVID-19 using China's Sinovac Biotech vaccine.
A ceremonial vaccination is scheduled at 8 a.m. Friday, Dr. Diane Cajipe, the hospital's spokesperson, told ABS-CBN News.
The recipients were chosen after they were screened last week. Most of the workers were highly exposed to COVID-19 or those who handled patients who have caught the disease.
Those who will receive the CoronaVac shots will be monitored for several hours at a post-vaccination area, Cajipe added.
In a survey last month, half of the 1,500 employees of the hospital said they were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
Philippine health authorities started administering COVID-19 jabs Monday, a day after some 600,000 doses of CoronaVac arrived from China.

Angelina ""Helen"" Tan, M.D. during her guesting at ANC's Headstart on February, 2020. Michael Bagtas, ABS-CBN News
MANILA - The Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) said Thursday it is open to the plan of the COVID-19 National Task Force to look into a lawmaker’s recent vaccination against COVID-19 there.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez earlier said in a television interview that they plan to investigate the inoculation of government officials supposedly with the Chinese-donated vaccines, which are meant for health workers.Quezon Rep. Helen Tan had said that she was vaccinated on the second day of the hospital’s vaccine rollout as her son works as a surgeon at the VMMC, where personnel have allocations for their families under the government's legal vaccination program.
READ: House health panel chair gets COVID-19 jab
But based on the government’s priority list, frontline healthcare workers, the elderly, and other frontline personnel should be vaccinated first, given limited supply of the COVID-19 jabs.VMMC Director Dr. Dominador Chiong Jr. said that Tan’s intention was given a different meaning when she accepted Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine.“Congresswoman Helen Tan, personal na opinyon ko lang ho ito (this is just my personal opinion), being the chairman of the (House Committee on) Health, even wanted to show to everyone that vaccination with the Sinovac would be most advantageous. With her position, she could have access to whatever vaccine she wants. Mukhang nababaligtad ‘yung intent eh (It looks like the intent became different),” said Chiong.

He added that given the number of personnel under the Department of National Defense (DND), its attached agencies and the VMMC, the DND decided there is room to allow the allocation of vaccine doses to a maximum of three dependents per employee.
Sought for comment on reports that authorities want to investigate her vaccination, Tan said there is no need to investigate her vaccination.“I can’t see any reason for them to investigate. I am a medical doctor despite being a congresswoman. [A] part of my regular rounds every week is giving free consultation to sick people,” she said.Tan, in a separate statement earlier in the day, also said she did not receive any “special treatment” during the vaccination and that the COVID-19 vaccine was a “rightful allocation” to her given that her son works at the said hospital.The lawmaker also emphasized that her inoculation was legal.“In getting COVID-19 shot, it was my intention, more than anything else, to help boost vaccine confidence of the public in the face of widespread concerns of Filipinos on the COVID-19 vaccine's effects, efficacy, and safety,” the statement read.“As far as I know, I did not violate any existing laws, legal guidelines or regulations whatsoever when I took the jab,” she added.VACCINATION AT THE VMMC
Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana previously said that with just more than 14,000 who registered to get Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine in his department, they would only need close to 30,000 of the 100,000 doses donated by China.The rest, he said, would be given to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
The VMMC, meanwhile, aimed to complete first the rollout of its Sinovac vaccine allocation before requesting AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shots.
“Ang magpapabakuna lang ng AstraZeneca ‘yung hindi na-cover ng Sinovac by virtue ng age nila. Iilan lang naman ‘yung personal choice,” he added.
(Those who want to be vaccinated with AstraZeneca are only those people not covered with Sinovac by virtue of their age. Only some people had it as their personal vaccine choice.)VMMC sees increasing confidence in Sinovac's COVID-19 shots, as the hospital recorded steady growth in the daily number of vaccine recipients for the first three days of its inoculation program.The hospital vaccinated 365 of its personnel, as well as some staff from the DND, last Monday. It was also able to vaccinate some 776 personnel on Tuesday and 1,117 on Wednesday.
The Philippines has secured 600,000 COVID-19 shots from Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech, and is set to receive later Thursday 487,200 doses of the coronavirus vaccine from Britain's AstraZeneca.

MANILA - A rapid vaccination drive in the second and third quarters will lead to economic recovery by the fourth quarter, Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion said Thursday.
Arriving vaccines should be used for the vaccination program in the second and third quarters to help micro, small and medium enterprises bounce back, Concepcion said in a statement.
Election spending and the Christmas season can also help recovery, he said.
“With vaccines to start coming in by May onwards, especially in the third quarter, that will bring in a lot of confidence...the last quarter of 2021 which is Christmas, I believe is going to be the chance for many of our MSMEs to get back on their feet. That should be the time that the economy must really be bouncing back,"" Concepcion said.
""Upon the arrival of the vaccines, people must be vaccinated so that by the fourth quarter, consumer confidence would increase. Then we’ll have spending because of the Christmas season and the elections,"" he added.
Some 600,000 doses of Sinovac arrived in the country over the weekend while AstraZeneca jabs are expected to arrive on Thursday night.By May, there could be some 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines through the ""A Dose of Hope"" program. The remaining 14 million doses will be delivered in the third quarter, he said.
Increased spending after the inoculation program complements existing stimulus packages such as Bayanihan to Heal as One Act and the CREATE bill meant to lower corporate income tax, he said.
Concepcion also pushed for further easing of restrictions by placing the entire country under modified enhanced community quarantine.
Gross domestic product (GDP) of the country contracted by 9.5 percent in 2020, its worst since the World War 2. It was growing at an average of 6 percent before the coronavirus pandemic.

(UPDATE) Kasado na ngayong hapon ng Huwebes ang pagbabakuna kontra COVID-19 sa health workers sa Cebu City.
Dumating nitong Martes ang higit 7,000 doses ng Sinovac vaccine na ituturok para sa mga health worker sa Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC).
Libo-libong doses ng Sinovac vaccines dumating sa Cebu, Davao
Unang babakunahan si VSMMC chief Dr. Gerard Aquino, na susundan ng iba pang opisyal ng ospital.
Inaasahan ding magpapabakuna ngayong Huwebes si Dr. Jaime Bernadas, director ng Department of Health (DOH) sa Central Visayas, at chief pathologist na si Dr. Mary Jean Loreche.

Nakikipag-ugnayan naman ngayon ang VSMMC sa iba pang mga DOH-accredited hospital para sa mga health worker ng mga ito na interesadong magpabakuna ng Sinovac.
Target matapos ngayong linggo ng DOH sa Central Visayas ang pagbabakuna sa higit 2,000 health worker na pumayag magpaturok ng CoronaVac, ang bakunang gawa ng Sinovac.
Samantala, tuloy-tuloy naman ang pagdating ng Sinovac vaccines sa iba pang panig ng bansa.
Dumating din ngayong Huwebes sa Legazpi City Airport ang nasa 12,000 doses ng bakuna para sa 6,000 health workers sa Bicol Region.
Idaraos ang pagbabakuna sa 4 na pilot hospital sa rehiyon, kabilang ang Bicol Medical Center sa Naga City, Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital sa Legazpi City, Bicol Region General Hospital and Geriatric Medical Center sa Camarines Sur, Bicol Medical Center at NICC Doctors Hospital sa Naga City.
Mula Legazpi City Airport, ibibiyahe ang mga bakuna papunta sa cold storage facility ng DOH-Bicol bago dalhin sa mga pilot hospital.
Sa Biyernes nakatakdang magsimula ang pagbabakuna sa rehiyon.
Nasa 8,700 doses ng bakuna rin ang dumating ngayong Huwebes sa Laguindingan Airport sa Misamis Oriental.
Dadalhin ang mga bakuna sa warehouse ng DOH-Northern Mindanao.
Inaasahang sa Biyernes mag-uumpisa ang pagbabakuna sa Northern Mindanao na gagawin sa Northern Mindanao Medical Center, ang COVID-19 referral hospital sa rehiyon.
Dumating naman sa Davao City ang 21,600 Sinovac vaccines, na dagdag sa 12,000 doses ng bakuna na natanggap ng lungsod noong Martes.
Sa Biyernes nakatakdang magsimula ang pagbabakuna sa Davao City, na idaraos sa Southern Philippines Medical Center.
Base sa Febraury 8 master list ng Davao City Health Office, nasa 16,677 medical front liners ang eligible o maaaaring mabakunahan laban sa COVID-19.
Umarangkada nitong Lunes ang COVID-19 vaccination program ng gobyerno sa ilang ospital sa Metro Manila.
Target ng pamahalaang mabakunahan ang nasa 70 milyon ngayong taon para makamit ang herd immunity, na isang paraan upang mapigil ang pagkalat ng COVID-19.
Pero tingin ng DOH ay mahihirapan ang bansa na maabot ang herd immunity kung patuloy na mag-aalangan at tatanggi ang mga Pilipino na magpaturok.
'Herd immunity mahihirapang maabot kung marami ang di magpapabakuna'
Maliban sa Sinovac vaccines, na dumating nitong Linggo at donasyon ng Chinese government, inaasahang darating ngayong gabi ng Huwebes ang higit 487,000 doses ng COVID-19 vaccine ng AstraZeneca mula sa COVAX Facility.
Sa tala nitong Miyerkoles, umabot sa 582,223 ang kabuuang bilang ng COVID-19 cases sa Pilipinas, kung saan 12,389 ang binawian ng buhay.
Unang nakapagtala ng COVID-19 case ang bansa noong Enero 30 ng nakaraang taon, sa isang Chinese female tourist na galing sa Wuhan City, China kung saan pinaniniwalaang nagmula ang naturang sakit.

“We thus press that the elderly PDLs (persons deprived of liberty) and those with grave illnesses, whom we focused on in our frustrated petition at the Supreme Court for humanitarian releases, be elevated for priority immunization as part of the most at-risk groups to directly control the spread of sickness and deaths inside prison facilities, which also affects the communities surrounding them,” said Fides Lim, spokesperson of KAPATID, a support group composed of families and friends of political prisoners.
The group released the statement after it initially asked the government to include prisoners in the country’s mass vaccination program. The DOH replied on Thursday to assure KAPATID that “groups at significant high risk including all Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDLs) as determined by the BJMP and BuCor, are included in the Priority Eligible Group B-9.”
Health Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje wrote that “no Filipino will be denied for his/her right to get vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine.”
Lim, wife of political prisoner Vicente Ladlad, said she worried about her husband who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD patients are among those at risk for severe COVID-19.
“Not a day passes that I also don’t worry for my own husband Vicente Ladlad, 71, a longtime activist foisted with planted firearms to keep him in indefinite detention. He suffers from ACOS (Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome), which has a higher disease burden than either condition alone and makes COPD sufferers like him more susceptible to COVID-19,” Lim said in her letter.
She mentioned that 2 political prisoners — Adelaida Macusang, 61, and Rodrigo Lazar, 44 — have died due to COVID-19.
“Of the 683 political prisoners as of January 2021, 96 are sick with life-threatening illnesses and 58 are elderly—all cramped in the same congested, disease-ridden prison facilities with the rest of the 215,000+ PDLs in the country,” Lim said.
She said 75-year-old political prisoner Jesus Alegre was also rushed to the Ospital ng Muntinlupa, because the “hospital at the New Bilibid Prison Maximum Security Compound is ill-equipped to care for him.”
She said another political prisoner, Elizabeth Estilon, 41, is scheduled to give birth soon.
Last year, COVID-19 clusters were detected in jails and other closed setting while the cases peaked in the Philippines.

KAPATID also asked for the specific categories under the priority eligible groups “for full transparency to reassure all sectors and groups how and wherein they are included in the national deployment plan of COVID-19 vaccination, which should have the required standards of safety and efficacy.”"

MANILA - The supposed ""no vaccination, no work"" policy of some companies is impractical, the labor department and an employers' group said Thursday.
Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said his agency would create a department order ""for the guidance of both the employee and the employer.""
""Wala namang ganung polisiya, batas at higit sa lahat hindi praktikal 'yan dahil wala pa tayong sapat na vaccine,"" he told ABS-CBN's Teleradyo.
(There's no such policy or law and most of all it's impractical because we don't have enough vaccines.)
The Employers Confederation of the Philippines also denied that companies were implementing such a policy.
""'Di namin malaman saan nanggaling ang balita na 'yun...Wala. Unang-una hindi praktikal, karamihan sa mga kompanya, 'yung maliit, ay umaasa lang sa bakuna ng gobyerno. Di mo alam kailan darating 'yun at kung gusto magpabakuna ng mga tao talaga,"" ECOP president Sergio Ortiz-Luis Jr said.
(We don't know where those reports came from. It's not practical, many companies, especially small firms, rely on government's vaccines, we don't know when it will arrive and if people want to be inoculated.)
""Yung mga nagimport naman sumusunod lang sa schedule ng gobyerno 'yan so paano maiimpose ang no vaccination, no work.""
(Those who imported only follow the government's schedule so how can we impose no vaccination, no work?)
Companies who have procured their own vaccine supply should not give it to their employees at a cost, Bello added.
""Kung bibili sila sa kanilang inisyatibo, hindi sila pwede magbenta sa kanilang mga empleyado. Unang-una gobyerno naman ang sasagot sa vaccines ng lahat,"" he said.
(If they buy at their own initiative, they can't sell ito to their employees. Government will shoulder vaccines for all.)
""Okay lang (bumili) pero kailangan ibigay nila nang libre. Kung di nila maibigay nang libre, eh 'di wag nilang pilitin ang employee nila na gumamit.""
(It's okay to procure but they should give it for free. If they can't do that, they shouldn't require their employees to take it.)
The private sector, in a tripartite agreement with government and AstraZeneca, has procured 17 million vaccine doses, of which half would be donated to government frontliners.

MANILA - A prompt rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program to reach most of the population will fast track the reopening of the economy and pave the wave for recovery, an economist said Thursday.
The impact of the vaccination of most of the population will eventually make its way to the real economy but it will be “slow going” as the Philippines is among the last countries in Asia to start its inoculation drive, ING Bank head of research and chief economist Rob Carnell told ANC.
""It’s going to start working its way to the real economy once you’ve got enough of these vaccines out. You really do need to get a lot of people vaccinated before you’re going to start seeing the number of daily cases falling and the ability then for the government to really start opening the economy,"" Carnell said.
Vaccination will work faster in terms of economic recovery rather than further interest rate and reserve requirement cuts, he said.
The Philippines has received an initial 600,000 doses of China's Sinovac.At least 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines are also expected to arrive on Thursday night, Palace spokesman Harry Roque earlier said.
Officials have begun inoculating frontliners in the Philippines on Monday.

MANILA (3rd UPDATE) — The Philippines on Thursday received its first batch of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine supply from the global vaccine-sharing initiative COVAX Facility, a boost in its immunization drive following the arrival of Chinese vaccine CoronaVac earlier this week.

The shipment of 487,200 doses touched down in Manila around 7:10 p.m., according to state media. These arrived a few minutes earlier than expected, via a KLM flight from the Netherlands. The plane is currently at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Pasay City.
The vaccines were towed to Villamor Air Base's Kalayaan Hall, before they were delivered to a warehouse of Metro Pacific Investment Corp in Marikina City.
President Rodrigo Duterte, officials from the inter-agency task force leading the country's pandemic response, Department of Health (DOH), World Health Organization, and UNICEF Philippines welcomed the vaccine's arrival at NAIA.Duterte appealed to Filipinos to get vaccinated, as the national government aims to further reopen the Philippine economy, which has been battered since March last year by strict lockdowns to curb COVID-19 transmission.“Please get vaccinated against COVID-19 and be the government partner in preventing further spread of the disease. I encourage you to get vaccinated the soonest possible time. These vaccines are safe and they are key to reopening our society,” the President said in a speech at the welcome ceremony.
WHO country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the Philippines should expect another 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca jabs to arrive in May through the COVAX Facility.
He stressed that the arrival of the COVID-19 shots in the Philippines does not mean Filipinos can be complacent, adding that minimum public health standards — such as wearing of face masks, frequent hand-sanitization and physical distancing — must still be followed.
“Economic revival will still need to be carefully calibrated to prevent future surges of cases to avoid unnecessary loss of lives, and to minimize the need to have lockdowns,” he said in his speech at the ceremony.
The AstraZeneca shots, developed in South Korea, came from Belgium and stopped over at Bangkok before being transported in the country, the health department earlier said.It is the second batch of vaccines to officially reach the country following the arrival of COVID-19 jabs from China's Sinovac last Sunday.The jabs are separate from the 17 million doses that the private sector and local governments procured, presidential adviser for entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion earlier said.
AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines to arrive by early March: official
The Philippines is set to get a total of 5.6 million COVID-19 shots from COVAX Facility. The government will pay for one-fourth of these doses, while the rest will be given for free, officials had said.
The WHO-led facility is an initiative that aims to ensure equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines.
Earlier Thursday, the WHO said over 4.5 million AstraZeneca doses would be delivered to the Philippines from March to May via the vaccine-sharing platform.

Shots developed by UK's AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Sinovac have emergency use authorization in the Philippines.Regulators have also allowed the ""compassionate use"" of 10,000 doses of vaccine from China's Sinopharm for President Rodrigo Duterte's security detail. Some members of the Presidential Security Group had received the said vaccine as early as September last year despite a lack of authorization from the country's drug regulator.

The Philippines' vaccine czar, Sec. Carlito Galvez, Jr. said the country is acquiring 161 million doses of various COVID-19 vaccine brands as around 70 million people are being targeted for inoculation to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus.
Terms sheets have been negotiated with 7 pharmaceutical groups, and the bulk of the vaccines are expected to arrive in the second and third quarters of this year.
The Philippines as of Thursday has recorded 584,667 coronavirus infections, including 12,404 deaths and 37,226 active cases, the highest since October 31.

Nagsimula na ang pagbabakuna sa East Avenue Medical Center sa Quezon City ngayong Miyerkoles sa pagdating ng kanilang suplay ng CoronaVac vaccines mula Sinovac.Magmula alas-12 ng tanghali ng Miyerkoles, nasa 144 staff na ng EAMC ang nabakunahan.
Si Health Secretary Francisco Duque III ang nagturok sa medical chief ng ospital na si Dr. Alfonso Nuñez at isang nurse na si Rosemarie Reyes sa ""ceremonial vaccination"" ng pasilidad.Hangad ni Nuñez na maprotektahan ng mga bakuna ang health care workers habang patuloy silang nagsasalba ng buhay ngayong COVID-19 pandemic.Watch more in iWantTFC

Pero noong inaasahang Pfizer ang darating na bakuna, nasa 95% ang gustong magpabakuna.
“Nasa 60 to 70 percent [ang] dating [nag-no] na nag-yes na magpapa-vaccinate,” ani Famaran.
“Medyo malawak ‘yung information dissemination dito sa ospital pertaining to Sinovac, pertaining to the information with regard to the side effects, kaya na engganyo ‘yung [mga nag-no] na mag-yes for Sinovac inoculation,” paliwanag niya.
Sa 3 araw na rollout ng Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine sa Tala hospital, nasa 221 na ng paunang 300 doses ang naiturok sa personnel nito. Nasa 21 minor adverse events naman ang naitala matapos mabakunahan.
May 3 vials naman daw, na katumbas ng 3 doses, ang itinuturing na wastage.
Kung madaragdagan umano ang gustong magpabakuna, pwedeng humingi ng dagdag na dose ng COVID-19 vaccine ang ospital.Kung hindi naman mauubos sa Biyernes ang doses ng bakuna na ibinigay sa ospital, sabi ni Famaran, magtatawag na sila sa substitution list.
“‘Yung quick substitution list, just in case lang na hindi namin maubos’yung vaccines good for 300 persons, by Friday. Kung may natitirang vaccines,” aniya.

“Dahil ang ibinigay na dose pa lang sa amin is 300, sabi namin mauubos namin 'yung 150 persons today. Meron kaming 5 stations dito sa aming malaking gym,” sabi ni Liquete sa panayam sa TeleRadyo.
Ang NKTI ay may 2,400 na health care workers. Bagama't marami ang nagpa-register para magpabakuna, normal lang aniya para sa iba ang magkaroon ng agam-agam at naisin na maghintay na muna.
Hindi naman makakasama si Liquete sa mga babakunahan gamit ang Sinovac dahil lampas na ang edad niya sa age group para dito.Samantala, ibinahagi rin ni Liquete na itinatayo na ngayon ng pansamantalang COVID hemodialysis facility na magkakaroon ng 20 stations. Inaasahan aniya itong matatapos sa Abril.
“Ang problema namin noon maraming nagda-dialysis na COVID patient,” sabi niya.
Dagdag niya na ang pansamantalang pasilidad ay itinatayo sa tulong ng Inter-Agency Task Force at Department of Public Works and Highways.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/03/03/21/brazil-governors-to-buy-vaccines-directly-due-to-slow-federal-rollout,Brazil governors to buy vaccines directly due to slow federal rollout,Reuters,Posted at Mar 03 2021 08:33 AM,"BRASILIA - Brazilian state governors scrambling to secure COVID-19 vaccines said on Tuesday they are getting together to bypass President Jair Bolsonaro's government and buy shots directly because of delays in the federal inoculation program.
Half of Brazil's 26 governors visited pharmaceutical company União Quimica in Brasilia, which will produce Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine. São Paulo's government said it will buy 20 million doses.
Sputnik V would have to be authorized for emergency use by Brazil's health regulator Anvisa before the doses can be used.
Piauí Governor Wellington Dias said they hope Anvisa can authorize emergency use by next week, but União Quimica's top executive said in an interview that the company is still filing paperwork.
Brazilian states, facing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases that are overburdening their hospital wards, are frustrated with the Bolsonaro administration's failure to secure timely supplies of vaccines.
With more than a quarter of a million Brazilians dead from COVID-19 - the world's second-deadliest outbreak - Brazil is seeing its highest weekly tolls since the pandemic began a year ago. Yet little more than 3% of its 210 million people have been vaccinated.

União Quimica, a private company that produces human and animal medicines, plans to start producing the Russian vaccine in April in a transfer of technology from Moscow's Gamaleya Institute that includes local production of the shot's active ingredients.
Company Chief Executive Fernando Marques said he expects to make 90 million Sputnik V doses this year, but how many will be available to Brazilian states or exported to neighboring countries will depend on the volume demanded by his company's priority customer, the federal government.
""We will start producing in April and only then will we be able to see what surplus we can supply,"" he said by telephone.
So far, Brazil has relied on limited supplies of the Chinese vaccine Coronavac, made by Sinovac, and AstraZeneca Plc's vaccine developed with Oxford University.
João Doria, governor of São Paulo - the country's most populous state - said this week his government would bypass the federal Health Ministry if it failed to supply the needed vaccines. On Tuesday, he told reporters his state will go ahead and buy 20 million doses of the Russian vaccine.

MANILA - The government is planning to deploy all 600,000 Sinovac vaccine doses to different hospitals across the country within the first week of March, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., said Wednesday.
The country began rolling out its vaccination program on Monday using shots from Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech, which arrived on Sunday. The 11 hospitals where the vaccines were deployed so far were able to inoculate 2,793 as of Tuesday evening, said Galvez.

(Our target for the end of the week is to deploy almost 600,000. Our target for this week is to dispatch, distribute all doses to the different regions.)
He said the initial demand allocation set was for 202,182 individuals in Luzon, 51,140 for Visayas, and 94,540 for Mindanao. Each person is supposed to receive 2 doses.
Those in excess of 600,000 would be filled in by the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine when it arrives, he said.

(Initially, on the first day, there was almost no one who wanted to get it, only about 13 percent requested for it. Now, almost everyday, there are congressmen and mayors who want to have hospitals in their areas also given the vaccine.)
Galvez was among the first recipients of the COVID-19 vaccine at the Philippine General Hospital on Monday. He said he did not experience any side effects and the pain on his shoulder is gone.
However, he said 12 individuals who received the vaccine experienced ""very minor adverse effects"" and 154 others were ""deferred"" after a medical screening.
The Philippines has logged 580,442 total coronavirus infections as of Tuesday, after 6 straight days of more than 2,000 new cases.

A health ministry statement said 10% of the 12,000 doses it received were given to the Palestinian national football team, government ministers, presidential guards and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization's topmost Executive Committee. Another 200 doses went to the Jordanian royal court, after a request from Amman.
But it said the other 90% went to health workers treating COVID-19 cases in intensive care units and emergency departments, and health ministry workers.
The ministry statement followed criticism from several Palestinian human rights and civil society groups, who urged an investigation into the vaccination program, saying it was not transparent.
“The incoming information and testimonies point to ongoing cases where vaccines are obtained by several parties, in disregard of the principle of priority in distribution,"" the groups said in a joint statement on Monday.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - who last month announced the first elections in 15 years - has long faced accusations of nepotism and cronyism. In a December poll, 86% of Palestinians questioned said they viewed PA institutions as corrupt.
But, defending its vaccination program, the health ministry said the ministers and security officials who received vaccines were ""in direct contact with the president and the prime minister."" Others were election officials and the football team needed vaccination certificates because they were travelling abroad, ""to represent Palestine in a match.""
The West Bank and Gaza, home to a combined 5.2 million Palestinians, have received around 34,700 vaccine doses to date. These came from small donations by Israel and Russia as well as 20,000 sent by the United Arab Emirates to Gaza.

The numbers lag far behind Israel, which has vaccinated more than one-third of its nine million people in one of the world's fastest roll-outs.
Palestinians have accused Israel of ignoring its duties as an occupying power by not including them in its inoculation program.
But Israeli officials have said that under the Oslo peace accords, the PA health ministry is responsible. (Additional reporting by Rami Ayyub; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)

The Philippine economy is expected to start off its rebound with a near 10 percent rebound in GDP growth this year, but there are few roadblocks to this. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News/File
MANILA - The Philippine economic recovery post-COVID is expected to start off with a near 10 percent rebound in GDP growth this year, but there are few roadblocks to growth.According to credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings, there are still ""relatively broad COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines which itself can, and will also have and continue to, have a cooling impact on economic activity.""
PH economy seen growing up to 13 percent in Q2 due to 'low base effect'
""That is part of the story too though but perhaps not as large a component as the containment measures themselves,"" said Andrew Wood, Director for Sovereign ratings at S&P Global.
Vincent Conti, Senior Economist for Asia-Pacific at S&P, said prolonged lockdowns and high inflation would also be a serious downside risk.“If restrictions are in place much longer than what we are currently seeing, that does put a big dampener on the growth prospects of the economy. The other risk that would compound this, would be currently the inflation that Andrew mentioned,"" Conti explained.
""They are supply side in the sense they are driven by food pretty much, pork and vegetables, and they are transitory. But they do weigh on the disposable income that is left for households to spend on other types of consumption at a time when things are already very difficult,"" he said.
Wood noted the inflation in the Philippines is actually quite high compared to other countries.
“There are inflationary concerns all around the world at the moment, and these are at time roiling financial markets, and if we look at this chart, we are seeing a bit of an interesting trend around the world where some indices are starting to pick up. But perhaps the most notable uptick here amongst these peers, is really that line for the Philippines,"" he said.
S&P Global still expects the Philippine economy to do well this year.""The good news is we see a strong recovery kicking off in 2021. In terms of how our forecasts are shaping up, we are looking at 9.6 percent growth this year. I think it is very clear that it's almost a mirror image of the contraction we had last year, of just over 9.5 percent,"" Wood said.
The Philippines' gross domestic product contracted anew in the fourth quarter shrinking 8.3 percent to bring the full year 2020 growth to -9.5 percent, the Philippine Statistics Authority said earlier.

“Nagpadagdag na kami. 1,200 una naming hiningi. Ang aming pakay pinakamaraming mabakunahang papayag so sa estimate baka umabot kami ng 2,000,” said PGH Director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi.
(We asked for more. We initially asked for 1,200. Our goal is to have as many employees vaccinated as we can so we estimate the number to reach 2,000.)

In an interview on TeleRadyo on Wednesday, Legaspi said the DOH acted immediately and delivered the additional supply.
Legaspi shared that they had a good experience with their vaccination program as many people showed up to be vaccinated.“Siguro nung nakita ng mga tao na ang mga doktor na nangunguna ay pawang naniniwala na importante itong pagbabakuna, kahit anong brand basta mabakunahan po,” he said.

PGH has inoculated 611 employees so far, he said. He shared that they only expected around 50 people to turn up on the first day, but 128 came.“Kahapon, ang dumating 483. I think in the NCR (National Capital Region) kami na 'yung pinakamarami ngayon,” he said.
(Yesterday, 483 people showed up. I think we have the biggest number now for the NCR.)
He added that even nurses and doctors assigned at their COVID-19 area also joined the vaccination program despite earlier reservations.
Earlier, some PGH workers had expressed concern over getting vaccinated with Sinovac shots as the Chinese vaccine is known to have a lower efficacy rating than other brands.
“Nagulat kami na meron sa kanila na kinuha na ang bakuna dahil naniniwala sila na kung ano ang nandyan na, kukunin na nila kasi 50 percent is better than nothing,” he said.
(We were surprised that there were some of them who decided to get vaccinated because they believe that they should get whatever is available because 50 percent is better than nothing.)
On Monday, Legaspi was among those inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine at the PGH.An initial batch of the vaccine from China arrived in the country on Sunday, and the doses were immediately rolled out to different hospitals in the country.
Legaspi said he felt “nothing out of the ordinary” after getting the jab except for a little pain on the injection site.
But he said they received reports from PGH workers who experienced symptoms like body pain and low grade fever after the vaccination, but no one required immediate medical attention.
Legaspi said they expect the vaccination program for the first dose of the vaccine at their hospital to end by Thursday, but would extend it if more people continue to show up.They are also setting the schedule of the second dose of the vaccine by Holy Thursday or Good Friday."

Only a handful of African governments have launched mass vaccination campaigns, whereas some countries in wealthier parts of the world have already administered millions of doses.
Many rely on the World Health Organization's vaccine-sharing scheme COVAX, which delivered its first doses last week with a shipment to Ghana.
The World Bank said financing projects were being prepared in African countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Niger, Mozambique, Tunisia, eSwatini, Rwanda and Senegal, without disclosing the amount of support under discussion.
""The funds are available now, and for most African countries, the financing would be on grant or highly concessional terms,"" a bank spokesperson said in response to questions.

Biden also announced that Merck & Co Inc would help make rival Johnson & Johnson's single-shot COVID-19 vaccine, a partnership similar to those seen during World War Two.
US to distribute 4 million J&J COVID vaccines by Tuesday
Johnson & Johnson's one-shot COVID-19 vaccine effective and safe - FDA staff
With three vaccines now available, Biden said he was confident there would be enough vaccines available for each adult in the United States by the end of May.
The Democratic president said he was upbeat about reaching his goal of delivering 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office, but urged Americans to remain vigilant in wearing masks and observing social distancing.
""Today's announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic,"" Biden said in a televised statement from the White House. ""But I have to be honest with you. This fight is far from over.""
Biden's drive to get educators vaccinated more quickly comes amid a political controversy that has pitted parents pushing for schools to reopen against the teachers unions that helped put him in the White House and say the risks are still too great.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said Biden's announcement was ""great news for everyone who wants in-school learning.""
Biden, whose new education secretary took office on Tuesday, said increased production of the three vaccines would boost what he called a ""national imperative"" to reopen U.S. schools given growing mental health concerns and widening disparities caused by the challenges of remote learning.
Biden said over 30 states had already taken steps to ensure educators were vaccinated and that he was using the full authority of the federal government to direct the remaining states to follow suit.
""My challenge is this: We want every educator, school staff member, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March,"" he said, noting that parents were exiting the labor market in ""astonishing numbers"" to help their children learn remotely.
To meet that goal, Biden said the federal pharmacy program would prioritize the vaccination of pre-kindergarten through Grade 12 educators and staff, as well as childcare workers.
He said he was still pushing to have most schools open by the end of his first 100 days in office, but added that it required passage of the $1.9 trillion rescue plan working its way through Congress. The plan includes some $130 billion for the nation's schools.
""Let's treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is, and that means getting essential workers (who) provide that service - educators, school staff, childcare workers .... vaccinated immediately,"" he said.
Vice President Kamala Harris swore in Education Secretary Miguel Cardona at the White House on Tuesday.
Cardona, the former head of Connecticut's education department, pledged in an op-ed published by USA Today on Tuesday to convene a national summit on safe school reopening this month.
He said the department would also act as a clearing house for best practices and lessons learned during the pandemic, while updating a handbook of strategies for meeting students' needs and addressing the loss of instructional time.
He did not endorse calls for a national summer school plan, but said academic enrichment activities, including in-person accelerated learning, tutoring, and mental health services, could start to level the playing field for the next school year.

GENEVA/LONDON - The COVAX vaccine-sharing program said on Tuesday it will deliver 237 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 shot to 142 countries by the end of May as it steps up the global roll-out of its vaccine supplies.
The timeline for the delivery of doses, made by AstraZeneca and by India's Serum Institute, will be split into separate two-month schedules, COVAX said in a statement, with the first in February-March and the second in April-May.
""These timelines are dependent on a variety of factors including national regulatory requirements, availability of supply, and fulfillment of other criteria such as validated national deployment and vaccination plans,"" the statement said.
COVAX is the program backed by the World Health Organization and GAVI vaccine alliance to provide vaccines for poor and middle-income countries. It began its roll-out last week with the first deliveries of shots to Ghana and Ivory Coast.

""It can't be overemphasized enough that we are undertaking the largest and most complex vaccine rollout in history,"" Seth Berkley, GAVI chief executive officer, told a news conference.
""We are just starting, but we should see more and more countries being served in coming weeks and months including those at all income levels and across the world,"" he said.
Hailing the campaign as an ""unprecedented partnership"", WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Angola, Cambodia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria could also expect deliveries of COVAX-supplied vaccines on Tuesday.
""This is an unprecedented partnership that will not only change the course of the pandemic but also change the way the world responds to future health emergencies,"" Tedros said.
Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo told the same briefing that his West African country, which this week began its inoculation campaign with COVAX doses, aimed to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of 2021.
The COVAX statement said that as well as the first round of allocations of the AstraZeneca vaccine, some 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot were also anticipated for delivery in the first quarter of 2021.
COVAX hoped to finalize a deal with Novavax for 1.1 billion doses in coming weeks, Berkley said.

Katrina Domingo, ABS-CBN News
MANILA - Pasig City on Tuesday began its COVID-19 inoculation program with only half of the 300 initial vaccination slots filled as some health workers in the city remained hesitant to take Chinese-made jabs.
As of 10:30 a.m., 153 health care workers from Pasig City General Hospital (PCGH) and Pasig City Children’s Hospital (PCCH) have been inoculated with Sinovac jabs, leaving some 147 vaccination slots available, according to PCCH acting administrator Arlene Samonte.
“I was asking some [health workers] and they said, ‘Takot po kami [magpabakuna],’” she told reporters.
(I was asking some health workers and they said 'we're scared to get vaccinated.')
“Probably they are also influenced by a lot of news na kung minsan ay (that sometimes have) no scientific basis also,” she said.
Several health workers have expressed hesitation to get vaccinated with the COVID-19 jabs from China's Sinovac after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said they may not be suitable for health frontliners directly exposed to coronavirus patients as the brand has a “lower efficacy rate of 50.4 percent.""An immunization advisory body later said Sinovac may be used for health care workers, concluding it is ""safe for use.""

But Pasig City COVID-19 referral facility head Dr. Nerissa Sabarre - the city’s first vaccine recipient - said Filipinos should not worry about receiving the Chinese-made jab.

(The 50 percent efficacy rate is already good for me because it’s better than nothing.)
Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) doctor Noel Cruz - who also availed of the Sinovac jab - said he felt safer after receiving the vaccine.

‘DON’T JUDGE’
Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto said health frontliners and other Pasigueños would not be forced to avail of any COVID-19 vaccine.
“Sa mga nag-aalinlangan pa, naiintindihan din po namin. Huwag po kayo mag-alala hindi po ito sapilitan,” Sotto said.
(For those who are still hesitant, we understand. Don’t worry because we will not force you.)
“‘Wag din natin i-judge 'yung mga health care workers na ayaw pa o natatakot pa,” he said.
(Let’s also not judge health care workers who still don’t want to be vaccinated or are still afraid of it.)
The mayor hopes that public confidence on COVID-19 vaccines would improve as more Filipinos sign up for government’s inoculation program in the coming days.
Sotto had repeatedly said he was willing to be vaccinated with any COVID-19 vaccine brand as soon as the Department of Health announces that government officials may already join the inoculation.
“The best vaccine is the vaccine that is readily available,” Sotto said.
“The best vaccine is the vaccine that we are able to use not tomorrow, but right now.”
Pasig City earlier ordered 400,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca, which would be distributed to Pasigueños via 16 inoculation sites as soon as the vials arrive.
The local government is willing to spend another P1 billion to purchase additional COVID-19 jabs for the city’s 700,000 residents, the mayor said.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/03/02/21/fda-confirms-sinopharm-finally-applies-for-emergency-use-of-its-covid-19-vaccines,FDA confirms: Sinopharm finally applies for emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccines,ABS-CBN News,Posted at Mar 02 2021 01:10 PM | Updated as of Mar 02 2021 01:28 PM,"MANILA — The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday confirmed that China state-owned Sinopharm has finally applied for emergency use authorization of its COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines.“An online application was filed yesterday afternoon and the FDA is checking the contents of the submission now,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo told ABS-CBN News.
Domingo has yet to respond if the submission included interim results for the vaccine’s Phase III clinical trials, which is crucial in determining the safety and efficacy of a vaccine for emergency use.
Currently, only Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sinovac have approved EUAs in the Philippines. The first batch of COVID-19 vaccines received by the country this week was from Sinovac.
Domingo could not give any further details on the Sinopharm submission, except that like in the case of Sinovac, they cannot guarantee a 21-day evaluation period.
This is because Sinopharm and Sinovac, which is a private company from China, do not have emergency use authorizations from a so-called Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA). They are also not included in the World Health Organization’s emergency use listing unlike Pfizer and AstraZeneca.Having an EUA from an SRA, which is recognized by the WHO, can expedite a company’s application within 21 days, as what happened to Pfizer and AstraZeneca.
Sinovac, on the other hand, took more than a month before it was approved, also because it was not able to immediately submit its Phase III clinical trial data.
There have been conflicting reports on whether Sinopharm has submitted its EUA request to the Philippines.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Monday morning said Sinopharm’s application was already submitted but Domingo said Monday afternoon that they have not received any. He also could not check their online submissions because the FDA main office was closed due to a local holiday.
China's Sinopharm seeks EUA for its COVID-19 vaccine in PH, says Palace; FDA yet to confirm
By Tuesday morning, DOH spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire said that there still is no application from Sinopharm, which turned out to be not true.
Sinopharm’s vaccine is said to have a 79% efficacy rate against COVID-19.

While China donated 600,000 doses from Sinovac, the Presidential Security Group (PSG) is expecting 10,000 doses from Sinopharm though a compassionate special permit.Sinopharm was supposedly the smuggled vaccine used by the PSG to inoculate its members despite the country not yet having approved COVID-19 vaccines at that time.

It is also the brand reportedly used by columnist Ramon Tulfo to have himself inoculated ahead of the government’s immunization campaign.

Roque on Monday mentioned that he personally believes that the compassionate use permit for Sinopharm might have the effect of covering “what happened earlier” with the PSG.
The FDA on Tuesday admitted that it is facing a blank wall in its investigation on PSG’s illegal inoculation since they are “not getting any information.”

MANILA - The Food and Drug Administration is facing a blank wall in its investigation into the illegal inoculation of President Rodrigo Duterte's security detail against COVID-19.
""Well, right now, if I tell you frankly, it's a blank wall. We're not getting any information. The DOH (Department of Health) is not getting information. Our people are still at it. I don't have any concrete information on that,"" FDA director-general Eric Domingo told ANC Tuesday.
Duterte in December bared that some members of the Presidential Security Group received Sinopharm shots. He later told them to ""shut up"" if summoned by Congress to explain their unauthorized vaccination.In February, the state medical regulator allowed Duterte's security team to import and use 10,000 Sinopharm shots.PSG gets go signal to use COVID-19 shots months after some members got unauthorized jabs
Domingo said they were also continuing their investigation on special envoy to China Mon Tulfo's admission of use of a smuggled COVID-19 vaccine.""We passed on the reports to our enforcement unit late last week. I guess they should be starting with the investigation now but I have no word from that yet,"" he said.
Tulfo had said he got hold of unauthorized anti-coronavirus shots from Sinopharm through a friend ""who smuggled it into the country.""
He took the illegally procured vaccine with some ""Cabinet-level"" officials, a senator and some members of Duterte's security team, the columnist had said in an interview with One News.

As the country launched its COVID-19 inoculation program Monday, Domingo called for vigilance against smuggled vaccines.
""I think this is the time we really have to watch out for smuggling. Once you get legal vaccines coming in, that's also the time that you know these evil people will take advantage and tried to smuggle in fake or even substandard drugs and try to pass them off and sell them as actual and legal products [or] legal vaccines,"" he said.

Francis Kokoroko, Reuters
ACCRA - Ghana launched its coronavirus vaccination drive on Tuesday with doses from the global COVAX vaccine-sharing program, which delivered shipments to other African countries as its vaccine rollout to developing nations accelerates.
The start of vaccinations in Ghana, and in neighboring Ivory Coast on Monday, along with the expected delivery of millions of vaccines from the COVAX program this week, will enable more poor countries to start inoculating mostly frontline workers and the most vulnerable, months after wealthier countries began.
COVAX is the program backed by the World Health Organization and GAVI vaccine alliance to provide vaccines for poor and middle-income countries. It said on Tuesday it aims to deliver 237 million doses of AstraZeneca's shot to 142 countries by the end of May.
Ghana receives world's first doses of free Covax vaccines
On Tuesday, COVAX delivered 3.92 million doses of the vaccine to Nigeria, 1.7 million doses to Democratic Republic of Congo, 624,000 to Angola and 36,000 to Gambia. Senegal expects 324,000 doses from the scheme to arrive on Wednesday.
""This is a historic and momentous occasion for The Gambia,"" Health Minister Ahmadou Lamin Samateh said in a statement.
In Ghana, people lined up outside the regional hospital in the capital, Accra, for a first phase of vaccinations which is prioritizing frontline health workers and others at high risk.
""I feel so good about taking the vaccine. It will protect me from contracting the virus from patients,"" said Bernice Anaglatey, 42, who works in the COVID-19 intensive care unit at Accra's Ridge Hospital as she queued for her shot.
The West African country aims to vaccinate 20 million people, or over 66% of its population, by the end of 2021, according to President Nana Akufo-Addo.
Drones from US-based startup Zipline delivered some of the vaccines to health facilities, making Ghana the first in the world to use the technology on a national scale to deliver COVID-19 shots, the company said.
Only a handful of other African countries have started inoculations, with doses bought bilaterally or received as donations.
Vaccine shipments through the COVAX scheme are expected to accelerate this week with the delivery of 11 million AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech doses.
Health authorities are also stepping up efforts to fight conspiracy theories around the vaccines. President Akufo-Addo and his wife were inoculated on Monday in an effort to boost public confidence in the vaccines.""The stories I heard about the vaccine have put fear in me,"" said Isaac Armah, a 28-year-old trader in Accra. ""I'll wait for about two months to see the effects of the vaccine on the early recipients, then I'll make up my mind.""
Coronavirus infections in Ghana have surpassed 84,000 and more than 600 people have died, according to health ministry data."

MANILA - Several Metro Manila mayors on Tuesday said they were willing to be inoculated with Sinovac's COVID-19 jabs as soon as the Department of Health (DOH) allows it to help boost public confidence in coronavirus vaccines.
The Philippines began rolling out COVID-19 vaccines on March 1, about a year since the virus entered the country. But health workers and other Filipinos have expressed hesitation on getting jabs, specifically China's Sinovac, the first to arrive in the country.
""I'm okay getting inoculated with Sinovac jabs given that FDA has approved it already, but with the caveat only if it will not deprive a medical frontliner of much needed jabs,"" Valenzuela City Mayor Rex Gatchalian told ABS-CBN News.
Manila Mayor Isko Moreno said he was eager to be inoculated against COVID-19, but would have to wait after medical frontliners get inoculated.
Isko Moreno willing to get Sinovac jab vs COVID-19
""Gustong gusto ko na magpabakuna ng Sinovac,"" the mayor told reporters, noting that he has been exposed to COVID-19 patients at least 7 times.
(I really want to be inoculated with Sinovac.)
""Araw-araw akong nasa risk tulad ng ibang mga mayor, pero patuloy pa rin tayong susunod sa national policy na unahin ang mga medical frontliner. I will wait for my turn,"" he said.
(Just like other mayors, I am at risk every day, but we have to continuously adhere to the national policy that medical frontliners should be the priority. I will wait for my turn.)
Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte, Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto and Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro have also expressed willingness to receive Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine to assure their constituents that the jabs from China are safe and effective.
""We must not deprive a single health worker of the vaccine since these are so limited at present and I am happy to wait for my turn in the list,"" Belmonte said.
""No'ng isang araw ay naisama ako sa listahan ng mga eligible, at hindi naman ako katulad ng mga health care workers na napakalaki ng exposure [at] napakalaki ng risk kaya ako ay nagqua-qualify sa Sinovac,"" Teodoro said in an interview on TeleRadyo.
(The other day, I was included in the list of those eligible [for the vaccination] and I'm not like health care workers who are highly-exposed and at risk [of COVID-19] so I qualified for the Sinovac vaccine.)
Marikina mayor says will receive Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine
Health workers have expressed hesitation about receiving Sinovac vaccines after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said these jabs may not be suitable for health frontliners directly exposed to coronavirus patients as the brand has a ""lower efficacy rate of 50.4 percent.""Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine not recommended for health workers - FDA

COVID-19 jabs from American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer was seen to have a 94 percent efficacy rate, while Europe's AstraZeneca's vaccines were estimated to have an efficacy rate of 70 percent after the first dose, and trials are ongoing to determine the efficacy rate after the 2nd dose.

A national advisory body on immunization, however, approved Sinovac's use for health workers despite the FDA's warning its efficacy may decline for those exposed regularly to COVID-19 patients.LOW TURNOUT
These worries over the efficacy of Sinovac were made apparent on the first day of COVID-19 immunization programs in Metro Manila.
In Pasig City, only 167 health workers from the Pasig City General Hospital and the Pasig City Children's Hospital availed of the free COVID-19 jabs, leaving vacant almost half of the initial 300 vaccination slots for medical frontliners, data from the local government showed.
""I don't have the exact numbers pero kung pupulsuhan natin, may iba na gusto na din ng Sinovac, may iba na nagdadalawang-isip pa kasi medyo bago,"" Sotto told reporters.
(I don't have the exact numbers but if we base it on estimates, there are those who want to be inoculated with Sinovac, but there are others who are still having second thoughts because it is new.)
""Ang importante naman diyan, habang dumadating 'yung mga datos, as we receive more data and information... makikita natin kung tumataas o bumababa ba 'yung confidence level,"" he said.
(What is important is while we receive more data and information... we will see if the confidence level is improving or dropping.)
In Manila, only 163 health workers or just over a tenth of the 1,500 initial vaccination slots for frontliners signed up during the first day of the capital city's COVID-19 inoculation program, according to the local government's public information office.
""Magpabakuna po kayo habang andidito po at may pagkakataon, lalong lalo na po ang ating medical frontliners,"" said Manila Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna, a doctor and the capital city's first to receive a COVID-19 shot.
(People, especially medical frontliners, should avail of the vaccine while it is still here and while there is a chance.) Bise alkalde ng Maynila, unang naturukan sa pag-arangkada ng COVID-19 vaccine drive'NO WITH RESERVATIONS'
Some medical frontliners were uncertain about the efficacy and possible side effects brought by the COVID-19 vaccine but became more open to being inoculated after their questions were answered, Gatchalian told ABS-CBN News.
""I noticed they (medical frontliners) are hesitant but not closed to the idea,"" he said in a message.
""They're not 'hard no' on the matter, but rather 'no with reservations,'"" he said.
The Valenzuela City government has started a massive information campaign both on print and social media to address clarifications about the COVID-19 jabs, the mayor said.
""They simply have questions, but once the questions have been answered they tilt to the 'yes [to being vaccinated] column,'"" he said.
A similar initiative was done in Navotas, Mayor Toby Tiangco told ABS-CBN News in a separate message.
The local government ""conducted NavoBakuna vaccination orientations to various sectors including barangay captains, barangay health workers, seniors citizens,"" indigent families and uniformed personnel, he said.
The city also ""conducted webinars with health experts"" and ""posted on social media testimonies of Navoteño frontliners in other countries who have been vaccinated,"" he said.
""[It's] part of the process to improve vaccine confidence,"" the Navotas mayor said.
Valenzuela, Navotas allot funds for COVID-19 vaccines'UNDERSTANDABLE' PUBLIC FEAR
The national government is trying to sustain the delivery of correct information about coronavirus vaccines to Filipinos to ease their worries, Philippine COVID-19 testing czar Vince Dizon told reporters.
The public's worries are ""understandable"" because this is the first time we saw a worldwide vaccination program as big as this, he said.
""Kailangan tuloy-tuloy lang ang pagbibigay ng impormasyon na tama, hindi 'yung impormasyon lang na nakukuha natin sa internet,"" Dizon said.
(We have to continuously provide correct information, not just any information from the internet.)
""Habang nagagawa natin 'yun, confident kami na tuloy-tuloy lang 'yung pagtaas ng kumpiyansa,"" he said.
(If we can do that, we are confident that the public's confidence will continue to improve.)

It is quite a pessimistic scenario, because that will mean you will have 2 more years where you have some kind of lockdown, and mobility restrictions, and this will of course take a toll on the economy, on government revenues, on the need for social protection,"" Chikiamco said.Consumer rights activist and former Trade Undersecretary Vic Dimagiba also said the forecast is dangerous, and urged the President to take back his statement.“Maniniwala s'ya dun kasi Pangulo sya eh.

Chikiamco said Duterte's statement undermines the vaccine program of his own government, as there are opportunities for the government to take charge of the situation through vaccination.“It seems to me they are quite setting a low bar for their own performance in terms of vaccination. Frankly, I think by the end of the year, there should be enough supply worldwide because by the summer of this year the US is projecting they would already be normal, and achieve their targets, so there will probably be an excess supply by the end of the year, for a lot of other countries,"" he said.Chikiamco also pointed out that other vaccine manufacturers are ramping up production.""So I think the best-case scenario is for us to be able to vaccinate our population by 2022.""

A medical institution reported that 172 vials of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which must be kept between -80 and -60 degrees centigrade, were rendered useless after the freezer breakdown over the weekend, Japan's health ministry said, wasting up to 1,032 doses.

Japanese government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said Tuesday that the cause of the malfunction was not yet clear, but the firm that installed the freezer would investigate and report back.
Kato said Japan had installed around 100 vaccine freezers nationwide by the end of February.
""We would like to respond quickly to whatever is necessary, based on what the results of the investigation carried out by the company that installed it,"" Kato said.
Japan began vaccinating healthcare workers in mid-February, with the minister in charge of the process admitting he had ""no idea"" how much of the population would receive the jab before the Olympics, which start on July 23.
As of March 1, it had administered first doses to nearly 32,000 doctors and nurses, according to vaccine minister Taro Kono.
The country has reached deals with three major drug firms to buy enough doses for its population of 126 million.
But it was also scrambling to secure enough special syringes needed to extract six full doses from each vial of the Pfizer vaccine.
Japan is running a cautious rollout programme and is planning to initially vaccinate 40,000 healthcare workers across the country, before administering jabs to around 3.7 million more in March.
Vaccines for around 36 million people aged 65 or older are set to start from April.

Ana Hospital administer Sinovac vaccines to fellow health workers from different hospitals in Manila on March 2, 2021. George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News
MANILA - The Philippine government on Monday launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive, boosting its battle against the outbreak that has infected more than half a million people.
Medical workers, soldiers and police in the capital region, the country's epicenter of the crisis, were among the first to be administered with the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech.
During the first day of the government's immunization program, health authorities recorded 13 cases of ""minor"" adverse effects, which include pain at the site of injection, nausea, and itching.
Despite low public confidence in vaccines, health officials have repeatedly allayed concerns that adverse reactions could occur as part of the immune response.
In its global manual on surveillance of adverse events following immunization, the World Health Organization classified the reaction into 5 categories - vaccine product-related reaction; vaccine quality defect-related reaction; immunization error-related reaction; immunization anxiety-related reaction and coincidental event.
For vaccine reaction, the UN's health agency refers it as an individual’s response to the inherent properties of the vaccine, ""even when the vaccine has been prepared, handled and administered correctly.""
Some minor reactions of the vaccine include pain, swelling or redness at the site of injection; fever, malaise, muscle pain, headache or loss of appetite.
For severe reactions, the WHO said it ""usually do not result in long-term problems"" and ""are rarely life-threatening.""
Meanwhile, immunization error-related reaction refers to errors in vaccine preparation, handling, storage or administration. Among the errors identified by WHO are non-sterile injection, reconstitution error, injection at incorrect site and vaccine transported or stored incorrectly.
WHO noted that during vaccinations, those inoculated may sometimes experience anxiety-related reactions due to fear of the injection. These are fainting, vomiting, hyperventilation and convulsions.
On the other hand, coincidental events occur ""after a vaccination has been given but are not caused by the vaccine or its administration,"" the agency said.
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also listed these common side effects after getting the COVID-19 shots: pain or swelling at the injection site; fever, chills, tiredness and headache.
""If you have pain or discomfort, talk to your doctor about taking over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, antihistamines, or acetaminophen, for any pain and discomfort you may experience after getting vaccinated,"" the agency said in an advisory.
""You can take these medications to relieve post-vaccination side effects if you have no other medical reasons that prevent you from taking these medications normally,"" it added.
However, the US CDC does not recommend taking the medicines before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent side effects ""because it is not known how these medications may impact how well the vaccine works.""
Those who got the COVID-19 vaccine may also apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth to reduce pain and discomfort where they got the shot.
The US CDC also advised drinking plenty of fluids and dressing lightly to reduce discomfort from fever.
""In most cases, discomfort from fever or pain is normal,"" it said. Only seek the help of authorities if the side effects are ""worrying"" or ""do not seem to be going away after a few days""."

According to Duterte, the Davao Regional Medical Center in Davao del Norte is the go-to hospital of almost all patients from the Davao Region, and even neighboring provinces outside the region.
""Now itong Davao Regional Medical Center, it caters to Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, Davao Occidental, the ComValley, which is now known Davao de Oro, and it caters some people from itong boundary ng Cotabato na mas malayo ang Cotabato City to Davao City so dito na sila,"" Duterte said during his weekly public briefing.

""Malaki ho ang Davao, it used to be the biggest city. Until now, Davao City is the biggest city in the world, I think, hanggang ngayon, and the population is, it's the melting pot of Region 11,"" he added.
(Davao is big, it used to be the biggest city. Until Now, Davao City is the biggest city in the world, I think, until today, and the population is, it's the melting pot.)
Duterte also boasted that Davao City is so big that one wouldn't be able to travel from its southernmost part to its northernmost part in one day.
""The Davao Region is not only Davao City but Davao City is as big as a province, that's why it's called the biggest city in the world,"" he claimed.
""If you go to the south side, you will not be able to go to the north side by sunset. That's how big it is to travel from one place to the other,"" Duterte also claimed.
A quick Internet search showed that the land area of Davao City is around 2,444 square kilometers, which is less than half the area of Forth Worth in Dallas (5,279 square kilometers), Philadelphia (5,430 square kilometers) or Washington, D.C. - Baltimore area (5,500 square kilometers), the cities that are named as the 10th largest cities by various websites.According to Demographia's annual World Urban Areas, the largest city in the world by land area is New York City Metropolitan Area (12,093 square kilometers).

MANILA - More than 700 health workers were inoculated with the coronavirus vaccine during the first day of the country's COVID-19 vaccine rollout on Monday using donated doses from the Chinese drugmaker Sinovac, officials said.
In an interview with ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo, Department of Health spokesperson Usec. Maria Rosario Vergeire said at 404 health workers from different hospitals in Metro Manila have already been vaccinated.
""Based on the current numbers that we have, we have about 404 who were vaccinated in these different hospitals,"" she said, adding that they have to receive the numbers from Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC), as of 8 p.m. Monday.

Johnson & Johnson, Handout/Reuters
WASHINGTON - Four million doses of the latest COVID-19 vaccine to get US approval will be delivered across the country as early as Tuesday, a senior administration official said.
The United States on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson's COVID vaccine for emergency use, boosting President Joe Biden's plan to battle the outbreak that has killed more than 500,000 Americans.
The single-shot vaccine -- the third type to be authorized -- is highly effective in preventing severe COVID-19, including against newer variants, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said before giving it a green light.
""Starting tonight, 3.9 million doses of J&J will be distributed across all channels -- states, tribes, territories, and pharmacies and community health centers. Those J&J doses will be delivered as early as this Tuesday morning,"" the administration official said Sunday on a call with reporters.
""That's the entirety of J&J's current inventory,"" the official added. ""J&J expects to deliver approximately 16 million additional doses by the end of March. So that's a cumulative 20 million.""
US authorizes Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine for emergency use: FDA
The J&J vaccine is the third to be greenlighted in the United States after Pfizer's and Moderna's were provisionally approved in December.
Over 65 million people in America have so far received at least 1 shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines -- but unlike those, the J&J vaccine requires just 1 dose, and is stored at fridge temperatures, offering logistical and practical advantages.
The J&J shot appears less protective than Pfizer and Moderna's 2-shot regimens, which both have an efficacy of around 95 percent against all forms of COVID-19 from the classic coronavirus strain.
In large clinical trials, the J&J vaccine's efficacy against severe disease was 85.9 percent in the United States, 81.7 percent in South Africa, and 87.6 percent in Brazil.
Overall, among 39,321 participants across all regions, the efficacy against severe COVID-19 was 85.4 percent, but it fell to 66.1 percent when including moderate forms of the disease.
J&J COVID-19 vaccine is 72% effective in the US, 66% overall in large trial
All 3 vaccines have been shown to fully protect against hospitalizations and death, however.
J&J had earlier announced it aims to deliver 20 million doses by the end of March, with 100 million by June -- though the US is pushing to expedite that timeline.

However, the state medical regulator said it does not recommend giving the vaccine to health-care workers exposed to the disease due to lower efficacy rate.

MANILA (UPDATE) — The daily tally of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines remained high on Monday as the Department of Health (DOH) logged 2,037 new infections, bringing the country's total since the start of the pandemic to 578,381.
It is the 5th straight day that additional cases counted more than 2,000. The ABS-CBN Data Analytics Team said the last time the Philippines saw 5 straight days of more than 2,000 cases was in mid-October last year.
One testing laboratory failed to submit results, the DOH said.
On Monday, the Philippines started its official vaccination against the coronavirus, which was reportedly first detected in China in late 2019. Manila announced its first case in January last year, involving a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the disease is believed to have first emerged.
Hundreds of Filipino health workers received the COVID-19 vaccine of Sinovac donated by China despite reportedly low vaccine confidence due to the brand’s lower efficacy rate among health workers exposed to COVID-19 in Brazil.

The DOH said active COVID-19 cases in the country stood at 31,708, or 5.5 percent of the cumulative total.
The death toll climbed by 4 to 12,322. Monday's number of newly reported deaths is the lowest in a single day since February 15, according to the ABS-CBN Investigative and Research Group.
Total recoveries, meanwhile, reached 534,351 as 86 patients more have recuperated from the disease.
Of those currently battling the disease, 89.3% have mild symptoms, 5% are asymptomatic, 2.5% are in critical condition, 2.3% have severe symptoms, and 0.89% have moderate symptoms.
A total of 8 cases, 6 tagged a recovered, were removed from the official tally for being duplicate entries, said the DOH.
The OCTA Group on Monday said Metro Manila has a 4-day average of 942 COVID-19 cases, which is 61% higher than the previous week.
It said the increase in cases might be due to a more transmissible COVID-19 variant, although the country has yet to do more widespread genome sequencing to check the real extent of the UK variant infections.
The research group estimates that if the trend continues, the daily tally of cases in the capital region may reach 2,200 by the end of the month. It also projected the total number of cases in the country to reach 665,000 and fatalities to reach 14,000 by the end of March.
According to the ABS-CBN Investigative and Research Group, the tally of new COVID-19 cases logged in January and February were both 8,000 to 9,000 cases higher than in December.
The total during the first 2 months of 2021 account for 17.78% or almost a fifth of the running total of 576,352 confirmed cases in the country as of Feb. 28, 2021.

MANILA - The Philippines will receive at least 161 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine doses by yearend, a government official said Monday, hours after the country began its immunization program against the deadly disease.
National COVID-19 task force chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr., in a public briefing, said that of the 161 million, 44 million will be procured from the COVAX Facility, an initiative which aims for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all.
This is 13 million more than the previous proposal to procure 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from 7 pharmaceutical companies.

The Philippines will have more or less 20 million doses of COVID-19 shots by the second quarter of 2021, according to Galvez.
""Sa third quarter po, diyan po lalabas lahat ng ating mga vaccines na ating bibilhin ... sa third quarter, meron po tayong 68 million. At doon po sa fourth quarter, meron po tayong 69 (million). All in all … meron po tayong 161 million doses,"" he said.

Galvez said COVID-19 vaccines will be delivered to Cebu on March 3, and to Davao on March 4. According to the official, Metro Manila is still the top priority of the country's immunization program among regions due to its large number of COVID-19 cases.
The national government aims to immunize 70 million of its 108 million people this year to achieve herd immunity and further re-open an economy, which saw its worst contraction on record last year due to the pandemic.
Galvez Jr. earlier said the government is eyeing to vaccinate 1.7 million health workers this March. Officials are expecting 1 million more doses this month after securing 25 million doses from Sinovac.

Reuters/Composite
LONDON - The Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines have been ""highly effective"" in reducing coronavirus infections and severe illness among elderly people in Britain, with a more than 80 percent reduction in hospitalization, official data showed Monday.
In the over 80s, a single dose of either vaccine is more than 80 percent effective at preventing hospitalization around three to four weeks after the jab, according to a Public Health England real-world study that has gathered data since January.
The study comes as France and Germany consider reversing their refusal to authorize the AstraZeneca vaccine for people over 65 due to concerns of its efficacy.
British Health Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the new study as ""extremely good news"".
""The detailed data show that the protection that you get from catching COVID 35 days after a first jab is even slightly better for the Oxford jab than for Pfizer,"" he added.
Both vaccines ""are highly effective in reducing COVID-19 infections among older people aged 70 years and over,"" added the study.
The Pfizer jab has offered protection against catching the disease of between 57 and 61 percent after the first dose, with the AstraZeneca vaccine offering protection of between 60 and 73 percent, according to the study.

""This adds to growing evidence showing that the vaccines are working to reduce infections and save lives,"" said Mary Ramsay, Public Health England's head of immunization.
""It is important to remember that protection is not complete and we don't yet know how much these vaccines will reduce the risk of you passing COVID-19 onto others,"" she added.
Britain has given the first dose of one of the two vaccines to more than 20 million people as part of a mass rollout that is seen as vital in taming one of the world's worst outbreaks, which has so far claimed almost 123,000 lives.
Asked about the skepticism in some European countries about the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said the results ""vindicated"" Britain's approach.
""I think in time the data emerging from the program will speak for itself and other countries will doubtless be very interested in it,"" he said.
Britain announced another 104 fatalities on Monday, and 5,455 new cases -- almost half the number recorded last Monday.
The number of COVID admissions to intensive care units among people aged over 80 has dropped to single figures in the last two weeks, Hancock said.
Britain will next week begin to unwind its third lockdown, with a plan for life to return to normal by the end of June.
The latest results highlighted the importance of everyone getting vaccinated, said Van-Tam.
""It shows us, gives us those first glimpses, of how if we are patient, and we give this vaccine program time to have its full effect, it is going to hopefully take us into a very different world. In the next few months.

Patrick Semansky/Pool/Reuters/File
WASHINGTON - Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official, said on Sunday he was encouraging Americans to accept any of the 3 available COVID-19 vaccines, including the newly approved Johnson & Johnson shot.
""All 3 of them are really quite good, and people should take the one that's most available to them. If you go to a place and you have J&J, and that's the one that's available now, I would take it,"" Fauci said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
The US government authorized Johnson & Johnson's single-dose COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday, making it the third to be available in the country following ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.
Both of those vaccines require 2 doses and need to be shipped frozen. The J&J vaccine can be shipped and stored at normal refrigerator temperatures.
The J&J vaccine was given final approval for widespread use on Sunday.
US authorizes Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine for emergency use: FDA
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed higher efficacy rates in trials that used 2 doses versus J&J's single-shot vaccine. However, Fauci and other experts say direct comparison is difficult because the trials had different goals and J&J's was conducted while more contagious new variants of the virus were circulating.
Fauci said studies are underway to determine their effectiveness and safety for children under 18, who are less likely to get sick from the virus.
Elementary-school students could get doses toward the end of the year or the beginning of next year, while high-school students could get it in the fall, Fauci said.
The new vaccine gives the US government another option as it tries to immunize as many Americans as quickly as possible. About 14 percent of Americans have received at least 1 dose so far, according to government data.
US to distribute 4 million J&J COVID vaccines by Tuesday
President Joe Biden has said there should be enough supply to vaccinate all Americans by the end of July.
COVID-19 has claimed more than half a million lives in the United States, and states are clamoring for more doses to stem cases, hospitalizations and deaths.
Daily infections have declined dramatically since their January peak, and some states have begun to loosen restrictions on public gatherings. However, Fauci warned that caseloads could rise again if officials move too quickly.
""It's really too premature right now to be pulling back too much,"" he said.

MANILA (UPDATE) — Philippine General Hospital (PGH) head Gerardo Legaspi on Monday received the first authorized dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines, just several hours after a batch of donated doses from the Chinese company Sinovac arrived in the country.
In a live feed of the vaccination via PTV, Legaspi received the CoronaVac jab from PGH nurse Chareluck Santos.
After being inoculated, he presented a certificate showing that he received the vaccine.

The vaccine developed by Sinovac is said to have only common vaccine side effects. No adverse or serious side effects or allergic reactions have been observed among those vaccinated with it.
Second to be vaccinated is Dr. Edsel Salvana, who is part of the Department of Health Technical Advisory Group and also a PGH doctor.
Next in line was Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo.

Legaspi and the other vaccine recipients were monitored for 30 minutes for possible side effects.
Also vaccinated at the PGH were Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman Benhur Abalos, Jr. and vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez, Jr.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque was also seen being screened for the Sinovac vaccine. But the tight supply of the shots prevented him from getting inoculated.
""Ako po, willing mabakunahan. Kaya lang, kagaya ng sinabi ni [PGH Director] Dr. Gap Legaspi ay ubos na iyong 100 [doses] nila for the day ‘no. We will have to come back on another day,"" Roque told reporters in an online briefing.
(I am wiling to get vaccinated. But, as Dr. Gap Legaspi said, their 100-dose allocation for the day has been used up.)
During his speech before the vaccination, Galvez said that while there are other vaccines with higher efficacy rate, “There is no such best vaccine dahil ang pinaka-best vaccine ay yung effective at efficient na dumarating ng mas maaga.”
(There is no such best vaccine because the best vaccine is the one that is effective and efficient that arrived earlier.)
PGH spokesman Dr. Jonas Del Rosario, who was earlier reported to be the first to receive the shot, said he was not vaccinated after latest tests showed he had a high amount of antibodies after recovering from COVID-19 last year.
He said he expects more health workers to get inoculated after 90 percent of PGH workers said they preferred a different vaccine.The Philippines is the last Southeast Asian country to receive initial vaccine supplies, fueling concerns over recovery prospects for a consumption-driven economy that suffered its worst slump on record last year due to the lengthy coronavirus lockdowns.A total of 1,200 doses were sent to the PGH on Monday after the Chinese company’s vaccines arrived in the country on Sunday.
Sinovac has an efficacy rate of 65.3% to 91.2%, based on vaccinations in Indonesia and Turkey. But its efficacy rate among health workers exposed to COVID-19 in Brazil was only 50.4%.While this is above the World Health Organization benchmark of 50%, it is significantly lower than other vaccine frontrunners like Pfizer and Moderna with 95% efficacy.
The Philippines has issued emergency use authorization for Sinovac, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Pfizer was supposed to be the first COVID-19 vaccine with an EUA to arrive in the Philippines, but it was delayed due to the indemnification agreement requirement.
There have been reports of smuggled COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines. Last year, members of the Presidential Security Group were inoculated using the vaccine candidate of another Chinese drugmaker, Sinopharm.

Galvez said he was personally instructed by President Rodrigo Duterte to be vaccinated at the PGH to address the low confidence of health workers towards Sinovac.
“Kahapon, binigyan niya (Duterte) ako ng utos na 'Magpabakuna ka para at least it will make them (health workers) feel na ang ating pamahalaan, ang lahat ng mga bakuna na inaangkat natin ay safe and effective',” said Galvez, a retired military general.

Health workers are first in line in the Philippines’ priority recipients of COVID-19 vaccines.
LIST: Sub-groups in COVID-19 vaccination priority
Surveys from different hospitals showed high confidence in the vaccines against the coronavirus.l But some reports, like that of PGH, showed a much lower rate of health workers willing to be vaccinated with Sinovac’s vaccine.
Galvez said that while efficacy rate in preventing COVID-19 may only be at 50%, there is 100% protection against severe illness and death.
Other hospitals that received vials of the Sinovac vaccine were military hospital V. Luna Medical Center; Dr. Jose N Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Tala, Caloocan; the Pasig City General Hospital; the Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame; and the Lung Center of the Philippines.Of the 600,000 donated Sinovac vaccines, 100,000 are supposed to be allocated for the Department of National Defense (DND).
In a statement, the DND said it will initially inoculate 14,520 individuals using 29,040 doses, and the remaining 70,960 doses will be given to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
The government aims to vaccinate 50 to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year, depending on the supply of vaccines.
Expected to arrive next are doses from AstraZeneca through the COVAX Facility, which aims for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.

The Philippines in March will get 1 million more Sinovac shots, and 3.5 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine fro Britain's AstraZeneca, said Galvez.Doses that will not be used by health workers would go to essential government workers like barangay emergency response teams, and ""influencers"" like mayors who could boost vaccine confidence, he said.
The Philippines has seen a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some areas like several cities in Metro Manila. Currently, there are a total of 578,381 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country, of which, 31,708 or 5.5 percent are active infections.

Robredo said this would boost public confidence in the vaccination program, after the Philippines received its first official vaccine supply on Sunday from Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac.
Duterte, however, said he was still waiting for his doctor's advice on which vaccine brand to use.""Siya (Robredo) man ‘yong apurado, siya ang mauna. Ako, I cannot just decide. She’s young, I am not. I have to defer to my doctor,” Duterte, who is 75 years old, said in a press briefing.(She is the one in a hurry, she should go first.)
Palace says VP Robredo 'welcome to join' first recipients of Sinovac jabs
The country's Food and Drug Administration does not recommend the Sinovac vaccine for the elderly, although the Chinese maker of the drug said it is effective for seniors.
Duterte said his doctor was considering his possible use of a vaccine by another Chinese pharmaceutical group. His spokesperson Harry Roque earlier said the President preferred getting COVID-19 jabs from Chinese state firm Sinopharm.Duterte prefers COVID-19 shots from China's Sinopharm
""Ano bang problema nila sa bakuna na talagang magpabakuna man ako? If I do not want to die and get COVID, I should get one. I go around a lot. I meet so many people on any given trip outside,"" said Duterte.(What's their problem with the vaccine, when I will really get vaccinated anyway?)
""Bakit dadramahin pa ‘yang sinong mauna, sinong… Ako magpabakuna. Ang problema, ang doktor ko may hinihintay.""
(Why should there be drama on who goes first. I will get vaccinated. The problem is my doctor is waiting for something.)The Philippine vaccination drive will begin with healthcare workers and military personnel.The Philippines is the last Southeast Asian country to receive initial vaccine supplies, fueling concerns over recovery prospects for the domestic economy that suffered its worst slump on record last year.
The archipelago, which has the second-highest tally of infections and deaths in the region, has suffered lengthy lockdowns, hitting hard a consumption-driven economy.
Despite the vaccine arrival, however, there is little public support for the inoculation drive. One opinion poll showed that less than a third of Filipinos are willing to get vaccinated as they worry about potential side effects.

MANILA (4th UPDATE) — More than a year since being hit with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippines on Sunday received its first official supply of vaccines that would jumpstart its inoculation drive against the coronavirus, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 shots from Beijing-based drugmaker Sinovac Biotech.A Chinese plane carrying the first batch of vaccines landed in Villamor Air Base at around 4 in the afternoon Sunday, according to state television network PTV.

The military will get 100,000 doses from the donation and the rest will go to select health workers of the country, which has recorded 574,247 total COVID-19 cases as of Saturday and has lagged behind its Southeast Asian neighbors in securing the vaccines.
Roque meanwhile said the Philippines should be thankful for the vaccine donation.
“Ang importante rin nating ipakita, iyong ating pasasalamat at utang na loob sa ating mga kapatid na Tsino, na sa pinakamadilim na yugto ng ating kasaysayan, nakapagbigay tulong naman ang Tsina,” said Roque.(It is important that we show our thanks and debt of gratitude to our Chinese brothers, that in the darkest chapter of our history, China gave help.)
Huang reiterated the safety and efficacy of SinoVac's CoronaVac jabs, saying they have been ""well-tested"" and used in many countries.
""I hope that the (Sinovac) vaccines will help kick off the Philippines's mass inoculation campaign to curb the pandemic and allow Filipinos to return to normal life at the earliest,"" he said in his speech at the welcome ceremony.
Huang added ""this has demonstrated China's determination to fight the pandemic in the spirit of solidarity and build a community"" with neighboring countries.WATCH: Workers begin offloading the crates of COVID-19 vaccines from the cargo plane.

The pandemic, which triggered quarantine restrictions in the country beginning March last year, resulted in a -9.5 percent GDP growth for 2020.It is the first contraction since 1998's 0.5 percent decline due to the Asian financial crisis and worse than the 7 percent contraction recorded in 1984, making it the steepest post-war slump in Philippine history, using available PSA data dating back to 1947.

George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News/File
MAYNILA – Kasado na ang nakatakdang pagsisimula umaga ng Lunes ng COVID-19 vaccination sa Lung Center of the Philippines sa Quezon City.
Isa ang Lung Center sa mga referral hospitals para sa mga pasyenteng may COVID-19.
Sa advisory ng ospital, nakasaad na magsisimula ang mga aktibidad para sa vaccination alas-9:30 ng umaga. Pangungunahan umano ito nina Health Secretary Francisco Duque III at Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Benhur Abalos Jr.
Sa naturang aktibidad din tatanggapin ni Duque ang bakuna ng Sinovac, na inaasahang dadating galing China ngayong Linggo.
Bukod kay Duque, babakunahan din ang 20 inisyal na staff ng ospital para sa photo session.
EXPLAINER: What's behind varying efficacy data for Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine?
Sa naunang survey, nasa 82 hanggang 90 porsyento sa 1,400 na kabuuang empleyado ng Lung Center ang pumayag na tumanggap ng bakuna ng Pfizer, ayon kay Dr. Norberto Francisco, tagapagsalita ng ospital.
Wala pang partikular na survey para sa Sinovac habang nagpapatuloy pa ang information drive sa ospital.""Pero hindi ho ako magtataka kung halimbawang mas marami ‘yong humindi,"" ani Francisco.
Rekomendasyon sa paggamit ng Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine sa health workers, 'di sapat: AHW
Dalawa ang binigay na pagpipiliang bakuna para sa Lung Center: ang CoronaVac ng Sinovac at ang produkto ng AstraZeneca.""Just yesterday, we got news about AstraZeneca as an available option. That totally changes the picture. Both are good, effective vaccines with just a minor specific characteristic. The choice of the individual is purely a personal one based on the available data,"" ani Francisco.
Ayon pa kay Francisco, higit 2 linggo nang handa ang kanilang ospital sa paghawak ng bakuna.
""Maraming practice na, marami na,"" aniya.
Binibigyan din ng pamahalaan ng pagkakataon ang mga health care worker na pumili ng bakuna kontra COVID-19 na gusto nilang matanggap.
Nauna nang sinabi ng Food and Drug Administration na hindi mairerekomenda sa health care worker na direktang tumututok sa mga COVID-19 patients ang bakuna ng Sinovac, bagaman maaari naman silang magpaturok nito kung gugustuhin.
FDA nilinaw na puwedeng tanggapin ng health workers ang Sinovac vaccines
EXPLAINER: What's behind varying efficacy data for Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine?
Ayon kay Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, sakaling tumanggi ang health workers sa Sinovac vaccine, mananatili pa rin silang prayoridad para sa iba pang darating na bakuna.
""Kung ayaw naman po ay wala talagang sapilitan,"" ani Roque.
Marami ang nagpahayag ng agam-agam sa bakuna ng Sinovac na donasyon ng China dahil sa mababang efficacy rate nito sa mga health workers na exposed sa COVID-19, batay sa resulta ng clinical trials sa Brazil.Gayunman, paulit-ulit na iginigiit ng gobyerno na sapat na ang 50.4-percent na efficacy rate para masabing epektibo ito bilang panangga sa COVID-19.""Ito (CoronaVac) ay safe vaccine at mapapakinabangan o beneficial ito sa health care workers,"" ani Roque.
Samantala, tumataas umano ang COVID-19 cases na hawak ng Lung Center, pero handa raw ang ospital na dagdagan ang dedicated beds kung kinakailangan.

MANILA - Filipinos eyeing jobs abroad are urged to get vaccinated against COVID-19, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration said Sunday as the country anticipates the arrival of its first supply of vaccines against the coronavirus.
""Kinakailangan po nila ito upang mapanatili at sigurado po ang kanilang safety and health sa countries of destination 'pag sila po ay na-deploy,"" POEA Administrator Bernard Olalia told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo.
(They need this so their safety and health in countries of destination are ensured.)
""Dahil sa vaccination ng iba't ibang destination countries, pinapayagan na silang bumalik. Karamihan sa merkado natin, unti-unti nang nagbubukas at tumatanggap ng ating balik-manggagawa.""
(They are now allowed to be deployed due to vaccination in various destination countries. Several sectors are re-opening and accepting returning workers.)
The Philippines is set to receive doses of China's Sinovac and the UK's AstraZeneca vaccines on Sunday and Monday, respectively. Overseas Filipino workers are included in the country's second priority groups for inoculation.

Olalia said the country's OFW deployment had declined in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Some 300,000 land-based OFWs were deployed last year, an 80 percent decrease from an annual average of 1.4 million in previous years, he said. The deployment of sea-based workers also halved to 200,000 from an average of 400,000 prior to the pandemic, he added.
The Department of Foreigns Affairs said that as of February 20 this year, a total of 368,736 overseas Filipinos have been flown home the government started its COVID-19-related repatriations.
Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said last week that the number of OFWs coming home as a result of the pandemic has declined from around 2,000 to 3,000 a day before, to a maximum of 1,500 recently.
""Nabawas-bawasan na,"" he told TeleRadyo Sunday last week.
The Department of Health will issue COVID-19 vaccine passports to those inoculated, Malacañang earlier said.

Senators, however, said they would move to replace the vaccine passports with COVID-19 vaccine card as it “connotes or affects mobility” and may be construed as discriminatory.

BANGKOK - Thailand kicked off its COVID-19 inoculation campaign on Sunday, with cabinet ministers, health officials and medical professionals among the first in the queue to receive vaccinations.
The first doses of vaccine, developed by China's Sinovac Biotech, were given to Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who is also the health minister, among others at an infectious diseases institute on the outskirts of Bangkok.
""I hope that the vaccination will result in people being safe from the spread of COVID-19 and it allows Thailand to return to normalcy as soon as possible,"" Anutin told reporters afterwards.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, 66, attended the event, although his age falls outside the range of 18 to 59 suitable to receive SinoVac's CoronaVac vaccine, so he did not get it.
Thailand received its first 200,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine from China and 117,00 imported doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine this week.
CoronaVac has been distributed to 13 high-risk provinces, which will start injecting front-line health professionals and volunteers on Sunday, the health ministry has said.
AstraZeneca's vaccine will be ready for use by the second week of March, after going through quality control tests, the company said in a statement.
Thailand is expected to take delivery of a further 1.8 million doses of CoronaVac in March and April.
A mass campaign to administer 10 million doses a month is set to begin in June, with 61 million shots of AstraZeneca vaccines produced by local firm Siam Bioscience.
With a tally of just over 25,000 infections, Thailand has escaped the kind of fallout suffered by some other countries since the pandemic began last year.

MANILA - Health workers can wait for another brand of vaccine if they don't want to be inoculated with COVID-19 shots manufactured by Sinovac Biotech, President Rodrigo Duterte said Sunday.
Duterte said health frontliners ""have a choice"" on which vaccine brand they want to be injected with, amid safety and efficacy concerns with Sinovac's product.
""Itong mga health worker, meron mga dadating [na vaccine] … it's either AstraZeneca or the Sinovac. Kung ayaw nila ng Sinovac, maghintay sila.

The President said he won't force health workers and the public to be injected with CoronaVac and other vaccine brands.
""For those who do not want to be vaccinated, okay lang sa akin (that's fine with me). Wala akong problema (I don't have a problem with that),"" Duterte said.
Health workers and experts have voiced their concerns on CoronaVac due to its only over 50 percent efficacy rate. The Food and Drug Administration granted its emergency use authorization in late February but earlier noted it was not recommended for inoculating health workers, which is the government's priority sector.

Duterte said vaccines from UK-based AstraZeneca will be arriving soon. But Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier revealed their arrival will be delayed.
At least 520,000 AstraZeneca vaccine doses were supposed to be delivered to the Philippines on Monday, but Philippine officials said the World Health Organization informed them it was having problems with the supply.
Duque said it may take another week for the COVID-19 jabs to arrive.

“We are running extended targeted studies tracking [vaccine] safety via national databases. We are also tracking the vaccine’s efficacy rate against the latest mutations,” Chen Wei, a researcher at the Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, said in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV on Saturday.
“We have been tracking and analysing a global database of Covid-19 patients with more than 400,000 samples through genetics and biologics. Our labs then cross-examine the responses of virus variants – such as the Brazilian, South African and British strains – to existing vaccines,” she said.
Chen, who is also a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said “research began a long time ago for a new and stronger vaccine targeting mutations”.
While it might not be necessary to have specialist vaccines for the different variants – much depends on how they respond to the Covid-19 vaccines already being rolled out – Chen said China wanted to be prepared for any eventuality.
“The vaccines [targeting variants] may not be used, but we have to prepare them,” she said.
The CCTV interview came just days after Chinese firm CanSino Biologics released an interim analysis of the results of its final-stage vaccine trials, which showed the product to have an efficacy rate of more than 65 per cent at preventing people getting Covid-19, and 90 per cent at protecting against severe symptoms.
The single-dose vaccine, known as Ad5-nCOV, was developed by CanSino in collaboration with a team of researchers, led by Chen, from the Institute of Military Medicine.
China has now approved four locally developed vaccines for general use, but has yet to give the green light to any foreign products.
Other nations and companies are also working on vaccine products to combat mutations of the coronavirus.
American firm Moderna said recently it had developed an updated version of its vaccine to fight the South African strain of the coronavirus and had sent it to the National Institutes of Health for evaluation.
US company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech are also looking into booster formulas for their Covid-19 vaccine, but said their original product was effective against the new strains, a claim echoed by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.
Earlier this month, a small study found a vaccine made by Chinese firm Sinopharm and a second developed by Chongqing Zhifei could trigger immunity against the South Africa variant of the coronavirus, but their effect appeared weaker."
