The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) began vaccinating ts personnel outside Metro Manila Friday, March 5, with the delivery of the first batch of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) jabs to soldiers based in Cagayan de Oro City.
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) (MANILA BULLETIN)
Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, AFP Chief of Staff, presided over the ceremonial vaccination of military health workers assigned at the Philippine Army’s 4th Infantry Division (4ID) using the CoronaVac vaccines from China’s Sinovac Biotech.
A Philippine Air Force C295 aircraft transported 600 vials of Sinovac vaccines from the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City to Lumbia Airfield in Cagayan de Oro.The shipment was then escorted by military and medical personnel to its destination at the 4ID headquarters in Camp Evangelista.
“We, in the armed forces, especially recognize how significant a progress the vaccination program is in the fight against COVID-19 not only for our troops, who have been serving as frontliners alongside our medical health workers, but most importantly for the needed protection of our fellow Filipinos in highly-vulnerable conditions,” Sobejana said.
The vaccines were the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines that were delivered by the military outside Metro Manila.
Sobejana said around 100 out of the total 300 frontliners assigned in 4ID were targeted to be inoculated during the ceremonial vaccination.The ceremonial vaccination of military health workers was headed by Colonel Jonna Dalaguit, commanding officer of Camp Evangelista Station Hospital.
Aside from Sobejana, the event was also witnessed by Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19.
Meanwhile, Sobejana said that the AFP is already planning the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to other areas outside Metro Manila through its land, air, and naval assets. He said the military has been coordinating with the Department of Health (DOH) to discuss the protocol on the handling and storage of vaccines prior to their delivery in other regions using military assets.“We are one with the government and the Health department in the full force implementation of the National Vaccine Deployment Program,” Sobejana said.
“I am urging all members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to join this effort so that we will be able to convey to our people the need for their cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,” he concluded. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“Don’t blame us. We are just doing our job.”
This was the stern reaction by the Public Attorneys’ Office (PAO) in response to a published article that “blamed” the office and its head, lawyer Persida V. Rueda Acosta, for the delay in the arrival of the vaccines against the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
PAO, an agency under the Department of Justice (DOJ), has been assisting families in the prosecution of those believed responsible for the deaths of persons inoculated with the anti-dengue Dengvaxia vaccine that is manufactured by French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi Pasteur.It has autopsied a total of 161 dead persons who were reportedly inoculated with Dengvaxia vaccine.
In 2017, then Justice Seretary and now National Police Commission (Napolcom) Vice Chairman Vitaliano Aguirre II directed PAO to “extend free legal assistance in civil, criminal and administrative cases to all possible victims of Dengvaxia related injuries, illnesses and deaths.”
It was alleged that one of the delays in the arrival of COVID-19 vaccinees is the reported demand for protection by pharmaceutical firms concerning from the possible adverse effects of their products.
“Clearly, the Dengvaxia cases cannot be faulted because as shown… it has always been the thrust of vaccine manufacturers to lobby for indemnification programs granting them protection from lawsuits associated with vaccine-related adverse events, especially in the case of COVID-19 vaccines,” PAO said in a statement.It said “the newspaper editorial blaming the PAO and the Chief Public Attorney for the ‘sudden’ demand by vaccine manufacturers for a vaccine injury indemnity mechanism and the delay in vaccine procurement is not only misleading but a ‘Fake News’ intended to derail the Philippines’ response to the C0VID-19 Pandemic.”
“Nevertheless, despite opposition attempts to politicize and discredit the government’s response to the pandemic, COVID-19 vaccines have arrived from China (Sinovac) and the Covax Facility (AstraZeneca), and hospitals have started vaccinating their healthcare frontliners,” it pointed out.

AstraZeneca’s coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine can give protection against the severe effects of the illness, an infectious disease expert said Friday, March 5.
San Lazaro Hospital Infectious Diseases Head Dr. Rontgene Solante emphasized that it is important to get vaccinated against the disease, especially those in the priority sector such as the healthcare workers and the elderly people.
A member of the OCTA Research Group Fr. Nicanor Austriaco on Wednesday, March 3, said that the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine against the South African variant of coronavirus “could be reduced from 70 percent to 10 percent.”Solante, meanwhile, cautioned the OCTA research team against giving such statements.
“If you read the statements and in fact, I’m going to the hospitals — (some) are telling me, ‘should I receive the Astra vaccines since I do not want to get the Sinovac, but there is this issue on South African variant,’ but I always assure them we don’t have problems with the South African variant,” said Solante in an interview on ABS-CBN News Channel on Friday, March 5.
“Just get the vaccine, the most important part is the willingness to get the vaccine.Yung mga variant na iyan doon na natin pag-isipan iyan later on (Let’s think about those variants later), just get the vaccine,” he added.
Solante said that the South African variant of coronavirus “is not a variant of concern as of this moment in the Philippines.”“We still need this vaccine and this vaccine is still a good additional vaccine for all Filipinos especially the frontline health workers, those with comorbidities, and probably those who are 65 years and above,” he said.
“The point there in the WHO (World Health Organization) findings in that particular trial, it did not prevent the influence of mild to moderate COVID for those who had a South African variant but nobody did develop a severe COVID even with that South African variant, Looking at immunological insights, there is still protection,” he added.
“And that’s what we want, especially those for higher risk of mortality. The impact of preventing them from dying from hospitalization,” he furthered.WHO Country Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe also said on Thursday, March 4, that AstraZeneca’s vaccine is effective against this particular variant.
“We still believe that the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective even in places where you have a large proportion of cases which could be attributed to the B1351 variant or the South African variant,” he said.
The first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines developed by AstraZeneca arrived in the Philippines on Thursday night, March 4, through the COVAX facility, a global initiative aimed at securing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Go, chairman of the Senate health and demography committee, however, emphasized that this should be done without prejudice to the priority list of the government’s national COVID-19 vaccination program which identified essential sectors as priorities, such as medical frontliners as well as poor and vulnerable sectors.
During the launch of the Malasakit Center in Rafael Lazatin Memorial Medical Center in Angeles City, Pampanga, Go was asked if he supports putting local officials in the priority list to get COVID-19 vaccine.The senator responded favorably, saying, “Bakit hindi? Kumpiyansa po ang kinukuha natin dito. Eh, kung ibig sabihin nga nito, kung ang Mayor ninyo nagpabakuna nga, so ibig sabihin magtiwala kayo (Why not? We are securing public confidence. If your Mayor will be vaccinated, this will boost public confidence [on the safety of the vaccines]).” If it would help allay the fears of the public on getting vaccinated, Go said that he would support such recommendation.
While getting vaccinated is voluntary, Go stressed its vital role in attaining herd immunity in the country.
“Wala naman po itong pilitan. Buhay po nila ‘yan. So boluntaryo naman po ito. Kami naman po rito sa gobyerno ay pinapaintindi namin sa kanila na tanging bakuna lamang po ang susi o solusyon dito sa ating problema kontra COVID-19 (Nobody will be forced to be vaccinated. That is their lives. This is voluntary. We in government, we just want the people to understand that the vaccine is the only key or solution to our problem against COVID-19),” Go said.
“Importante po dito ay ma-attain natin ‘yung herd immunity sa community. (It is important here that we attain the herd immunity in the community),” he stated.‘Pag ‘yung komunidad ninyo ay na-attain na ‘yung herd immunity, maiiwasan na ang pagkalat… kakayanin na po ng ating anti-bodies dahil po sa bakuna na ituturok sa tao. (Once your community has attained that herd immunity… the spread of the disease will be prevented. We will have the anti-bodies due to the vaccine that was injected to us),” Go added.
Go and President Duterte witnessed the turnover ceremony for the AstraZeneca vaccines which arrived in the country at 7:30 pm last Thursday.
The AstraZeneca jabs, which will be the second batch of COVID-19 vaccines to arrive in the country, are from the World Health Organization-led Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility, a global initiative that guarantees access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.The senator from Davao said during the interview that a plan has already been laid out identifying the strategic locations where the vaccines are going to be stored to ensure equitable access throughout the country.

“Team Europe is proud to contribute to the COVAX facility to help provide for affordable and fair access to vaccines for Filipinos”, EU Ambassador Luc Véron said in a statement. President Duterte, along with top government officials and foreign dignitaries, welcomed the arrival of the plane carrying the 487,200 vaccine doses from the COVAX facility at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) past 7 p.m. on Thursday.
The first batch of the vaccines, as well as the 40 million more doses to come, are part of the World Health Organization (WHO)-led COVAX facility allocation to which Team Europe is the biggest contributor. Véron said the Philippines will receive vaccines for 22 million Filipinos under the COVAX facility, aiming to inoculate 20 percent of the population and put an end to the acute phase of the crisis.To date, the EU has provided P130 billion (€ 2.2 billion) to help 92 low and middle-income countries, including the Philippines, to help gain access to COVID-19 vaccines. “The EU has both a responsibility and interest to make vaccines available to all”.
“The European Union has maintained its goal to work in solidarity for vaccine cooperation and multilateralism – none is safe until everyone is safe,” the EU’s top diplomat in Manila stressed.
The first batch of vaccines delivered to Manila is produced by the British-Swedish company Astra Zeneca. At the onset of the pandemic, the EU has invested billions not only into vaccine research but also diagnostics, treatment, epidemiology, protective equipment, as well as modernization of health systems. It was the main contributor behind the development of the first safe and successful vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, making it the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the EU.

CHICAGO, United States (Xinhua) — A research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis indicates that three new, fast-spreading variants of the virus that cause COVID-19 can evade antibodies that work against the original form of the virus that sparked the pandemic.

To assess whether the new variants could evade antibodies made for the original form of the virus, the researchers tested the ability of antibodies to neutralize three virus variants in the laboratory.
The researchers tested the variants against antibodies in the blood of people who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or were vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine. They also tested antibodies in the blood of mice, hamsters and monkeys that had been vaccinated with an experimental COVID-19 vaccine, developed at Washington University School of Medicine, that can be given through the nose.The B.1.1.7 (found in Britain) variant could be neutralized with similar levels of antibodies as were needed to neutralize the original virus. But the other two variants required from 3.5 to 10 times as much antibody for neutralization.
The researchers then tested monoclonal antibodies: mass-produced replicas of individual antibodies that are exceptionally good at neutralizing the original virus. When the researchers tested the new viral variants against a panel of monoclonal antibodies, the results ranged from broadly effective to completely ineffective.
Since each virus variant carried multiple mutations in the spike gene, the researchers created a panel of viruses with single mutations so they could parse out the effect of each mutation. Most of the variation in antibody effectiveness could be attributed to a single amino acid change in the spike protein. This change, called E484K, was found in the B.1.135 from South Africa and B.1.1.248 from Brazil variants, but not B.1.1.7 from Britain.
The B.1.135 variant is widespread in South Africa, which may explain why one of the vaccines tested in people was less effective in South Africa than in the United States, where the variant is still rare, said senior author Michael S. Diamond.“We don’t exactly know what the consequences of these new variants are going to be yet,” said Diamond, also a professor of molecular microbiology and of pathology & immunology. “It is clear that we will need to continually screen antibodies to make sure they’re still working as new variants arise and spread and potentially adjust our vaccine and antibody-treatment strategies.”
The findings are published Thursday in Nature Medicine. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

President Duterte is willing to fully reopen the Philippine economy once he sees Filipinos can easily avail themselves of coronavirus vaccines in health facilities across the country.
President Rodrigo Roa Duterte
The President laid down the “standard” that will convince him to further ease the movement restrictions after his economic managers have been “pestering” him to open the local economy some more.
According to the President, even education authorities were making a pitch for the resumption of in-person classes in some places but he remained reluctant pending the vaccination drive in the country.“If I see most of the citizens can avail of the vaccine in any of the health centers, hospitals, at wala ng — that is the standard, then I will reopen everything sa ating ekonomiya (in our economy),” Duterte said during his visit to Valenzuela City Thursday, March 4.
Before he decides on fully opening the economy, Duterte said Filipinos must be able to get vaccinated in any public health center or hospital without any hassle.
“Pag every Filipino ganyan ang sitwasyon na magpabakuna na lang sila, wala nang kulang at walang maraming kutso-kutso, then I will open it immediately (When every Filipino can get inoculated without any more fuss, then I will open it immediately),” he said
“For now pigil ako sa lalo na mga bata (For now, I am constrained especially when it comes to the children),” Duterte said.Duterte also gave an assurance that the government would exert all efforts to roll out the nationwide COVID-19 Vaccination Program “to enable us to reopen our schools and slowly resume our face-to-face learning.”
“To our students, I hope that despite the challenges ahead, you will persevere and strive hard[er] to excel and reach your [full] potential,” he said.
In an earlier Palace briefing, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said the President wanted a widespread vaccination effort before he considers the resumption of face-to-face classes in schools.He said the President would like to see around 2 million vaccines administered before deciding on the reopening of traditional learning in schools.
The President made the latest statement a few days after the government started its free immunization program, initially offering the vaccines to health workers.
After the delivery of the Sinovac vaccines last Sunday, additional doses of vaccines from AstraZeneca are expected to arrive in the country Thursday.
More than 400,000 doses will come from the World Health Organization-led global vaccine acquisition scheme.
The President is expected to attend the turnover ceremony at the Manila airport.The country is largely under the most relaxed community quarantine level after the government began easing the strict lockdown last year.
The pandemic lockdown, first implemented almost a year ago, has weakened the local economy, crippled business operations, and left many people jobless. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

While Filipinos have been asked not to be choosy with the brand of vaccines, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque has invoked President Duterte’s position in government as well as his senior age in justifying his right to choose the brand.
“Well you know, I think the President is the president and because he is over 70 years old,” Roque said during a televised press briefing when asked why the President can choose his vaccine brand despite not being a health worker.The country’s health workers, considered heroes for battling the pandemic in the front lines, are given the top priority to get the vaccine supply to enhance their protection against the illness. Next in the vaccination line will be seniors, poor and vulnerable citizens and essential workers.
The government earlier declared that all health workers must receive the free inoculations before other priority sectors will be vaccinated.
“Kung masusunod talaga, hindi talaga dapat magpabakuna pa si Presidente dahil hindi pa tapos ang mga medical frontliners (If the policy will be followed, the President must not really be vaccinated yet because the vaccination of medical frontliners is not yet complete),” Roque said.
The President earlier passed up on getting the Sinovac vaccines despite the recent delivery to the country. The Chinese-made vaccines have not been recommended for health workers, and instead may be used for healthy persons age 18 to 59.The 75-year-old Duterte instead opted to wait for another Chinese brand upon the advice of his doctor. The Palace earlier said the President wanted to be injected with the Sinopharm vaccine and will wait for its emergency use approval by local drug regulators. The Chinese drug manufacturer has reportedly filed its application for emergency use authorization before the Food and Drug Administration. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Indian pharmaceutical firm Bharat Biotech said Wednesday its domestically developed vaccine, criticized for being rolled out before final trials, was found in interim late-stage data to have almost 81 percent efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infection.

Questions had been raised by Indian medical experts about the effectiveness of Bharat Biotech’s “Covaxin” after officials authorised it for emergency use in January even though its Phase 3 trials — the last stage before regulatory approval — were not complete.
“Covaxin (not only) demonstrates high clinical efficacy trend against COVID-19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants,” Bharat Biotech chairman Krishna Ella said in a statement.The company added that “severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events occurred at low levels and were balanced between vaccine and placebo groups”.
It said interim phase 3 trial results for Covaxin — co-developed with the scientific agency leading the government’s response, the Indian Council for Medical Research — were based on 43 cases of COVID-19 among 25,800 participants.
Of the 43 cases, 36 were recorded in participants who received a placebo and seven in those who were given Covaxin, pointing to an efficacy rate of 80.6 percent after two doses for those who had not previously been infected by the virus, the company added.
The firm said it would share further interim analysis after 87 cases, with a final analysis planned for 130 cases.
The data from the second and final studies would also be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication, it added.
Covaxin, alongside the AstraZeneca/Oxford shot, is one of two vaccines approved for use in India.
The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine has been found to be about 62 percent effective in preventing infection. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were found to be more than 90 percent effective.Fears about the lack of efficacy data for Covaxin as India’s mass vaccination drive kicked off in mid-January saw some medical workers, including doctors, refuse to get the jab.
Activists had also accused the firm of cutting corners and breaching rules in conducting trials in India.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the Covaxin shot on Monday as the country opened up the process to those over 60 and any over-45s with serious illnesses.
Some 15 million shots have been administered so far in the vaccination programme, the health ministry said Wednesday.
The country has the world’s second-highest caseload with more than 11.1 million infections.The daily increase in cases has fallen sharply this year after peaking in September, although some regions have seen an uptick in infections in recent weeks. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The city’s healthcare workers received on Wednesday the China-made Sinovac vaccines at the Valenzuela Medical Center.
Dra. Maria Estrella Litam, chief of the Valenzuela Medical Center, was the first medical frontliner to receive the Sinovac shot in the city.Mayor Rex Gatchalian thanked the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases for “honoring the frontline workers by giving them vaccine.”
“Ngayon alam natin kahit na marami pa tayong COVID handled patients, eh protektado yung mga mamamayan natin… yung mga frontline workers natin (Now we know that even though we still have many COVID patients, our people and our frontline workers are protected),” Gatchalian said.
The mayor asked the city’s frontliners to be inoculated to help in encouraging the residents to get the vaccine as well.
“Sa mga na vaccinate na, tulungan niyo ho ang lokal na pamahalaan na ipaliwanag sa mamamayan ng Valenzuela na safe at dapat tayong magpabakuna pagdating ng mga supplies ng vaccine (For those who are already vaccinated, help the local government to explain to the people of Valenzuela that it is safe and that we should be vaccinated when the supplies arrive),” he said.The Valenzuela Medical Center also caters to residents of Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas and Southern Bulacan as it is the only public tertiary hospital for COVID-19 patients in the area.

As the number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Metro Manila is feared to further increase due to the rapid spread of the UK COVID variant, the OCTA Research Team recommended that health care workers get themselves inoculated immediately to boost their immunity from the virus.

In a virtual press conference on Wednesday, March 3, OCTA noted that the number of COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila could rise by 45,000 by the end of March to 280,000 cases from the current number of 234,754 due to the B117 or UK variant.
The group also projected that the number of deaths could rise by about 990 cases “unless everyone especially the national and local governments and health authorities work together in ensuring the spread of the disease is curbed.”OCTA Research fellows recommended that health care workers inoculate themselves with any vaccine available to boost their immunity from the COVID 19 virus, especially with the discovery of the South African B.1.351 variant in Pasay City, as well as the rising number of the UK B.117 variant in certain cities in Metro Manila, including Pasay and Makati.
In an online press conference staged for OCTA Research by BluePrint.PH, Dr. Nicanor Austriaco, OP, a molecular biologist from the Providence College in Providence, Rhode Islands, USA and a visiting professor in the University of Sto. Tomas, said.
There is still a possibility of containing the spread of the so-called “super-COVID variants,” the South African B.1.351 in particular, if the Pasay City government will undertake quick steps along with the city’s residents in containing the infection from spreading, said Fr. Nicanor Austriaco, a molecular biologist from the Providence College in the US and a visiting professor in the University of Santo Tomas.
“We still have a window to eliminate the B.1.351 from circulation. I am hoping that Pasay contain the spread. If the LGU can eliminate the B.1.351, then we are safe. Otherwise, we will have to talk about other options,” Austriaco said.In its March 1 report, OCTA Research said that the surge in cases of COVID-19 is already “inevitable” and that the only steps the government and the public could take is to reduce the potential number of cases by ensuring the containment of the disease through vaccination and practice of the minimum health protocols.
OCTA Research chief Guido David of the University of the Philippines noted that Pasay City and Makati City have registered the highest rate of increase in cases in Metro Manila.
“If this trend continues and the national reproduction number remains at around Rt 1.2, the country is projected to have 665,000 COVID-19 cases and 14,000 deaths by end of March. If the reproduction number is reduced to Rt 1, the total number of COVID-19 cases is projected to be 640,000 by month’s end, with 13,500 deaths,” David said.“On the other hand, if the reproduction number continues to increase and new COVID-19 cases continue to escalate especially in the NCR, the projection is 715,000 COVID-19 cases and 15,000 deaths by the end of March,” he added.
“This trend has been reversed, with significant positive growth in new cases observed in some LGUs in the region. In this light, based on our analysis of the data and the past trends in the NCR, we believe that a surge in its early stages has already started in some LGUs,” OCTA said.
However, it should be noted that this potentially serious surge in the NCR is still in its early stages and can still be mitigated, said OCTA Research fellow Ranjit Rye.
He said the inevitable rapid increase in COVID-19 cases could still be managed with the “implementation of appropriate and timely responses to reverse this increasing trend quickly and to prevent this ensuing surge from becoming full-blown and potentially overwhelming the health care system in the NCR.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Mayor Edwin Olivarez and Zuellig’s president and general manager Danilo Cahoy signed an agreement for the logistics services in the distribution of the vaccines in the city’s 16 barangays.
Olivarez said that he is hoping AstraZeneca shots will arrive in the country in the late second quarter or early July and will be welcomed by city hall and pharmaceutical officials.He said the city government already gave a 20 percent advance payment amounting to P9.6 million for the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The mayor also said that around 500,000 city residents will receive the vaccine once it arrives in the city.
Health workers will be prioritized in the vaccination program of the city government followed by essential service workers, security and traffic personnel, and senior citizens.
“Zuellig’s storage has a capability of up to 70 degrees centigrade. From the airport, the vaccines will be brought to their storage and to our vaccination centers here in the city,” Olivarez said.He added that the pharmaceutical company’s warehouse is located along West Service Road, South Superhighway in Barangay Sun Valley, and just a 10-minute drive from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).

Loreche revealed the second batch of the vaccines comprising of 7,000 doses will arrive between March 4 and 8.Loreche explained that health workers will be prioritized in the distribution of the vaccines.
“We look forward that they will be availing of the vaccines. This was given to them because we really care for our healthcare workers,” said Loreche.
Some of the vaccines will be allocated to other medical frontliners in DOH-retained hospitals, said Loreche.“We will be allocating the vaccines to both private and government hospitals. We have to remember that not all will be given with the vaccines right away. We want to prioritize those who are in the areas who are attending COVID-19 patients,” Loreche said. Loreche said keeping the CoronaVac vaccines at VSMMC will not be a problem. “Storage is not as difficult as Pfizer because Sinovac only requires to 2 to 8 centigrade which is the usual temperature that we use for our existing vaccines,” said Loreche.

Molecular biologist and OCTA Research Team fellow Fr. Nicanor Austriaco said the detection of the South Africa variant of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Philippines is “most concerning” as it could lessen the efficacy and protection of the AstraZeneca vaccine against this particular variant.
(Juan Carlo de Vela / MANILA BULLETIN)
Citing data from an international study, Austriaco said “the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine against the South Africa variant could be reduced from 70 percent to 10 percent.”
“If we do not eliminate the B1.351 (South Africa) variant in the Philippines, then the 17 million doses of AstraZeneca that we have bought, but are not here yet, will be ineffective,” he said in a virtual press conference on Wednesday, March 3.A person may need to have three doses of the remaining vaccines, “one extra just for the B1.351 variant,” instead of the normal two doses, Austriaco also said.
The Department of Health on Tuesday, March 2, confirmed the detection of the first six cases of South Africa COVID-19 variant in the country, three of which were traced in Pasay City.
Austriaco noted that the ongoing surge in the National Capital Region (NCR), particularly in Pasay City had the “hallmarks of a variant-driven surge.”
“We still have a window to eliminate the B1.351 from circulation. I am hoping that Pasay can contain the spread. If the LGU (local government unit) can eliminate the B1.351, then we are safe. Otherwise, we will have to talk about other options,” the OCTA expert explained.Citing a yet-to-be-published data from Brazil, Austriaco said Sinovac could be effective against the B1.351 variant. “In terms of long-term goal, you may want to pick Sinovac over AstraZeneca. It will protect you against the variant, while AstraZeneca will not,” he pointed out.
Austriaco cited that the detection of the B1.351 in country will not just be about pandemic control, but should also be about the “impact of this variant on our national vaccine strategy that we have just began.”
“So we have just began (but) we have already been hit in the stomach by a variant that if it not is controlled or eliminated, will be more difficult for us to vaccinate the 75 million Filipinos in order to acquire herd immunity,” he said.Moreover, University of the Philippines professor and OCTA research fellow Ranjit Rye pointed out that “OCTA is not suggesting either not to take one vaccine or the other.”
“There is a solidarity in OCTA to say that the best vaccine is the vaccine that is available now. We need to get our own health workers vaccinated. We need to get through our priority list as far as the vaccine is concerned,” Rye said.
“Whether it’s AstraZeneca or Sinovac, it is still better than not getting vaccinated at all. There are differences and nuances to each vaccine but they can be used, they will be effective. We encourage most especially our healthcare workers to get vaccinated, given the window of opportunity that we have, and given the reality that there is a (COVID-19) surge evolving in NCR,” he added.

The Sinopharm already submitted an application for the emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines.
“Very objective ang pag approve natin ng bakuna. May checklist tayong hinahanap dyan. Safety, efficacy, and quality. Basta umabot sa pamantayan ay magbibigyan ng authorization.

As long as they meet our standards, then we will grant them the authorization. If they fail, then we will not grant it to them),” said FDA-Director General Rolando Enrique Domingo during the “Laging Handa” press briefing on Wednesday, March 3.Currently, the submitted documents by Sinopharm are still lacking. It only submitted the Phase 1 clinical trial results and their letter of intent, said Domingo.
“We are still asking for additional documents before we can start evaluating their application,” he said.
“Mabilis naman ang proseso ng FDA basta kumpleto ang dokumento lalo na kung may EUA galing sa mga stringent regulatory authorities, like US FDA or WHO (World Health Organization), kaya namin iyan 21 days.

The FDA is also currently reviewing the EUA applications of Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute and India’s Bharat Biotech. So far, three vaccine developers were granted an EUA in the country: the American company Pfizer, British-based AstraZeneca, and China’s Sinovac Biotech.

DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III on Wednesday, March 3, said AstraZeneca will likely be the next vaccine brand that will be shipped to the Philippines. The AstraZeneca vaccines will be supplied by the World Health Organization (WHO)-led COVAX facility.
A total of 525,600 AstraZeneca vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines last March 1 but the shipment was delayed due to logistical concerns, said WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe in a television interview on Tuesday, March 2.“Ang malamang na susunod (na dumating) hopefully AstraZeneca.

Senator Nancy Binay on Wednesday urged the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) and local government units (LGUs) to immediately come up with a comprehensive medical waste disposal plan now that the COVID-19 vaccination program has begun.
Senator Nancy Binay (Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Binay said it is imperative to ensure that medical wastes would be disposed of properly in order to prevent harmful health risks, noting that while the Department of Health (DOH) has already provided “interim guidelines” for vaccine waste disposal, this might not be enough “because this isn’t a temporary problem.” “We’re dealing with infectious medical wastes here magnified in millions of used vials… yung basta na lang itatapon sa basurahan, kukunin ng truck ng basura at itatambak kung saan (the fact they can just throw it in the garbage bin, and collected by garbage trucks and would be left in some place) elevates public health risks,” Binay warned in a statement.
What is worrying, she said, is the capacity and capability of LGUs, especially from geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas, to approach and tackle medical wastes concerns.“I’m worried about the LGUs. Does everyone have a local vaccination plan and comprehensive medical waste disposal plan? Are our LGUs ready to come up with one once they start rolling out the vaccination program?” she pointed out.
“Without a local vaccination plan, these concerns could get out of hand, and we should be anticipatory rather than reactive regarding what threatens to be an environmental and public health hazard,” Binay said.
She noted that the way infectious healthcare waste is being processed and handled at a snail’s pace since the pandemic started has been alarming.
Binay has filed Senate Resolution No. 656 urging the IATF, in consultation with relevant stakeholders in the public and private sectors, to come up with a concrete plan on the proper handling and management of COVID-19 vaccination medical wastes in order to prevent harmful health risks.“Whereas, based on the Philippine National Development and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 Vaccines (Interim Plan, January 2021), waste generated at the health care facilities after vaccination may pose harm and risks to the health care workers and communities if not properly managed,” she said in the explanatory note of her resolution.
In her resolution, Binay further emphasized that proper planning and implementation of managing wastes generated in the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination is required, considering the complexity of the nature of the vaccines.
She noted that the cause of delay is due to the lack of capacity that waste treatment and disposal facilities have.“And partly because waste haulers need permits so the DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) can keep track of where hospital wastes go,” Binay said.
She reiterated the Philippines cannot afford to play catch-up, especially as the plan to vaccinate around 60 to 70 million Filipinos would generate massive amounts of waste.
“Our appeal then is for the IATF to make it part of the checklist for LGUs their comprehensive local vaccination plan and infectious medical/healthcare waste plan,” she said.
“In a span of two to five years, we expect more than 70 million Filipinos to get vaccinated, because these are double-doses and that would mean over 140 million units for the vaccine paraphernalia alone. We haven’t counted how much tons of concomitant waste would be there,” she said.
“I really hope that the IATF and LGUs are prepared once the vaccines start arriving. I hope the IATF would be serious on this too and not to forget it,” she added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

HONG KONG, China — Hong Kong’s public health authorities are investigating the death of a man with chronic diseases two days after he received the first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.
(Agence France Presse / MANILA BULLETIN)
The Department of Health of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, at a press briefing in the small hours of Wednesday, said it has not been clear so far that if the death is related to the vaccination and an expert committee will conduct the causality assessment to ascertain the cause of the death.
The 63-year-old man with chronic and respiratory diseases died at about 6:00 a.m. on Sunday at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He went to the hospital due to shortness of breath earlier on the same day.The government is very concerned about the incident and extends deep condolences to the deceased and his family, Ronald Lam, controller of the Center for Health Protection, said at the briefing.
The man was given the first jab of the vaccine on Friday.
Infectious disease expert Leung Chi-chiu said the death was unlikely to be caused by the vaccination and there have been no proved death cases related to COVID-19 vaccines around the world. He urged the authorities to find out the cause of the death and inform the public as soon as possible.
As getting the vaccine has more effects than risks, the ongoing vaccine rollout should not be stopped, Lam said. “Hong Kong has a strict vaccine approval system and its responding mechanism for adverse events following vaccination is the same with the international practice.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

On February 28, an initial batch of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccine arrived at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.Sinovac was the first among a number of Coronavirus vaccines set to inoculate thousands of Filipinos nationwide.
According to the Duterte administration, the country’s frontline healthcare workers will be the first ones to receive the Sinovac vaccine.
The Sinovac vaccine is currently undergoing Phase 3 trials in some countries. Currently in late stage trials in Indonesia and Turkey, the Sinovac vaccines have an efficacy rate of 65.3% and 91.25%, respectively.Last year, Pangilinan, along with some of the country’s top business leaders, also committed to support the national government in providing two million doses of AstraZeneca COVID vaccine for frontliners.
The vaccine was developed by the Oxford University in the United Kingdom.
“The protection of our health workers and public frontliners is indeed a priority,” he stressed.
“We equip our frontliners with PPE and we have also provided disinfectants and COVID testing extraction machines to hospitals nationwide — all these to ensure that we have the necessary means to help combat the pandemic.”
A vaccine will hopefully stem the pandemic, which is, literally a shot in the arm that we need,” according to Pangilinan.PLDT and Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC)’s support will be coursed through the PLDT-Smart Foundation to avail of the AstraZeneca vaccines for the country’s frontliners.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not authorized to release the clinical trial data of Sinovac vaccine, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Tuesday, March 2.
DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that only Sinovac Biotech can release their own data with regards to their coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine.
“The Food and Drug Administration does not have any authority at all to publish data that are not theirs. These data that has been submitted to them was a requirement submitted by the manufacturers. The FDA does not own these data,” said Vergeire in a press briefing.“Ang ating regulatory authorities bounded sila na kailangan ang mga dokumentong sina-submit sa kanila ay hindi nila naishe-share kahit kailan. Manufacturers have that right. The Sinovac manufacturers ang may karapatan pong mag-publish o hindi mag-publish, nasa kanila po yung ball na iyan (Our regulatory authorities are bound not to share the documents submitted to them. Manufacturers have that right. The Sinovac manufacturers have the right to publish or not (their data). They have that ball),” she added.
Before recommending the use of the Sinovac vaccine to medical front liners, Vergeire said that the local health experts were able to study the unpublished clinical data of the China-made vaccine.
Meanwhile, DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) is already reviewing the Sinovac vaccine.
“As we speak, the HTAC is now doing an evaluation of Sinovac already,” said the Health chief in an interview on ABS-CBN News Channel.“We belatedly received the trial data of Sinovac just last week and the FDA immediately submitted it to HTAC,” he added.
Duque said that the HTAC evaluation is being conducted for the procurement of Sinovac vaccines. “We expect that by about mid to third week of March, we will be able to see the procured one million doses of Sinovac,” he said.
The Health chief said that the HTAC review is not a prerequisite on the use of the initial doses of Sinovac vaccines since these are donations from China.“Ideally you would want that but this is needed when the vaccines are to be procured by the government. But for donated vaccines, nothing in the lawor provisions of the Universal Health Care law dictates that this should undergo HTAC because in the first place, the safety and efficacy evaluation is the mandate of the Food and Drug Administration,” said Duque.
“HTAC is really an economic tool to evaluate the cost-effectivenessof the vaccines but because this is not to be procured, the FDA evaluation of risk benefit analysis sufficed,” he added.

Recognizing the importance of keeping its stakeholders accurately informed on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, the Department of Education (DepEd) has expressed support to the government’s vaccine information drive.

“Vaccination works, not because it is someone’s opinion or because it is the sentiment of the majority, [but] vaccination works because it is the result of decades and even centuries of scientific endeavor, of studying, of further learning, of education,” Education Secretary Leonor Briones during the launch of a vaccine education campaign.
Dubbed, “Ugnayang Pang-paaralan tungkol sa Pagbabakuna para sa Kalusugan ng Bayan,” the campaign was held in partnership with UNILAB’s AKAP Guro CONNECTed program.It was also organized by the government’s Vaccine Cluster – Task Group on Demand Generation and Communications to inform the general public about the national vaccine deployment plan.
Briones encouraged everyone to keep themselves informed on the COVID-19 vaccine and the government’s vaccination program during the launch.
“I enjoin everyone to continue to advocate truth, believe in science, and foster critical thinking as we all take part in the government’s COVID-19 vaccination plan through our respective roles and jobs,” Briones said.
During the program, Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Vaccine Expert Panel Chair for COVID-19 Dr. Nina Gloriani was invited to discuss the vital processes of vaccine used to assure its safety, efficacy, and quality.“What’s important is we understand that the side effects and adverse effects is to determine causality – all together, the benefits must outweigh the risks or the side effects,” Gloriani explained in a mix of English and Filipino.
A local government unit (LGU) was also invited to show how the National Vaccine Deployment Plan (NVDP) is operationalized at the local level during the launch. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The government should notbe choosing who among the country’s health workers should be prioritized in the inoculations against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Senator Joel Villanueva said on Tuesday, March 2.
Senator Joel Villanueva
“If the virus doesn’t choose its victims, then why should we choose who among the hospital workers should get the vaccine first? Private or public, basta nanggagamot ng Pilipino, at may supply, bigyan (Whether they are public or private hospitals, as long as they treat Filipinos, and there is supply, then we should given them the vaccines),” Villanueva said in a statement.
“If there’s left from the allocation of public health workers because many of them aren’t taking it, then give the surplus to those who are willing to receive it,” he added.Villanueva made the comments after National Task Force against COVID-19 and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. disclosed on Monday that the St. Luke’s Medical Center has asked the government for an allocation of vaccines from Sinovac for its 5,000 workers.
Galvez said there will be a “mini rollout” of the vaccinations in the hospital’s two branches.
In appealing for the grant of vaccines to private health workers, Villanueva stressed that the government should avoid the “spoilage of a precious and scarce commodity”.
“Why deny it to vaccination volunteers simply because they are not in government employ? Iturok ang mga ito sa mga tatanggap. Ang bakuna po ay mahalaga, huwag i-aksaya (Vaccines are important, let’s not waste them),” he added.Villanueva earlier called on the government to augment the country’s vaccine supply and allow health workers to choose which vaccines they want to receive.

Senator Cynthia Villar
“I am happy that we finally have the vaccines here in the Philippines to stop the spread of the virus,” Villar said in a statement issued on Tuesday, March 2.
The availability of the vaccine, she said, “will have a positive impact on our lives as we can slowly go back go our jobs, promote livelihood opportunities, open up our industries and the economy and navigate a new ‘normal life’.”The senator added that Filipinos, especially health frontliners, would finally be protected from the deadly infection.“The vaccine connotes hope and a much better future for Filipinos,” Villar said.
The government started on March 1, its vaccination program among health workers in government hospitals as well as health personnel in the police and military.At least 756 health frontline health workers received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac, according to authorities.The Department of Health said at least 20 people experienced minor reactions to the vaccines.
Still, Villar reminded the public not to be complacent despite the vaccine rollout.“Do not let your guard down,” she said, citing compliance to health protocols such as the wearing of face masks and face shield, as well the regular hand washing in physical distancing. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In a radio interview, Villanueva, chairman of the Senate labor committee, said he moved for the inclusion of workers in the vaccination program’s “priority lane” because he knew that unless workers were given back their jobs, the economy would have a difficult time recovering.
“We believe that we will be able to recover only if our workers are protected,” he explained. “Protected workers equals jobs,” he added.Government data showed that up to 17 million workers lost their jobs at the height of enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) from March to April in 2020.Villanueva said millions of families suffered economically because of the pandemic.
“This is unacceptable,” he stressed.
Villanueva said there was only one thing needed for the country to get back on its feet: “Work, work, work.”The vaccination program, according to Villanueva, has been stripped of obstacles in sourcing and procurement of supplies by the law that Congress passed and which President Duterte signed recently.
“We increased the role of local government units (LGUs) and the private sector,” Villanueva said. “We are removing all excuses from those fond of excuses,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Anakalusugan Partylist Rep. Michael T. Defensor on Tuesday disclosed that not a single centavo from the P20 billion taken away from the budget for the pension fund of retired personnel of uniformed went to the procurement of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines.

(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
Instead, Defensor said portions of the slashed funding went to pork barrel funds, apparently for lawmakers.
Defensoraired these claims as he accused ACT-CIS Partylist Rep. Eric Go Yap, chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations,of lying before their Lower House colleagues for claiming that the P20 billion slashed from the military and police retirees’ pension fund went to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) fund.Defensor said Yap’s claim is simply “not true”The former made this claim a day after the two solons debated on the floor in connection with Defensor’s allegations about the slashed funding.
“The claim of appropriations committee chairman Rep. Eric Yap that P20 billion in military and police retirees’ pension money was diverted to Covid-19 vaccine procurement is not true,” said Defensor.
In a privilege speech on Monday, Defensor, former chairman of the House Committee on Public Accounts, accused Speaker Lord Allan Velasco of denying retired personnel of uniformed services at least P20 billion from their pension fund to boost congressional allocations for infrastructure projects.
Yap quickly rose to defend Velasco, saying that Defensor was mistaken about his accusations.Yap said it was he who decided to realign the fund to finance the procurement of COVID 19 vaccine.Defensor’s revelation opened a can of worms in the Lower House as Yap accused the administration of former Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of slashing P70 billion in proposed budgetary allocation for the same pension fund when the 2020 GAA was passed.
Yap also blamed Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab, his predecessor as appropriations chief, for the re-aligned pension fund.
Ungab swiftly belied Yap’s claim, saying that what the Cayetano speakership re-aligned was P209 billion and not P70 billion.He also decried Yap’s accusations, saying that the re-alignment was decided by Cayetano and then Deputy Speaker LRay Villafuerte behind his back.In his press statement, Defensor said Yap was wrong in claiming that the P20-billion in the 2021 budget was re-aligned for vaccine procurement.“To set the record straight, the vaccine procurement fund approved by Congress, as recommended by the bicameral conference committee (bicam) and carried in the 2021 budget, was P2.5 billion, which is good for just a few thousand doses and which was the amount recommended by the executive branch at the beginning of the pandemic,” Defensor stressed.
“That is the amount that is sure of funding, as it is part of the “programmed” portion of the national budget,” he pointed out.
According to Defensor an additional P172 billion was allocated by Congress but placed it in the ‘unprogrammed part of the outlay.”This means that the budget will be made available only if there are excess revenues.
Instead of relying on excess revenue collection, the Duterte administration decided to resort to “borrowing to finance the COVID-19 response measure”.“Through the bicam, Congress juggled at least P182 billion in appropriations recommended by President Duterte in his version of the budget. None of that, not even a centavo or peso, was added by the two chambers to the Palace-recommended P2.5-billion vaccine procurement fund,” said Defensor. He added: “The huge amount of realignments, including the P20 billion for military and police retirees, went to “pork” and other things, but not vaccine.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

To reverse the situation and encourage more to avail the free vaccination against COVID-19, the local government of Igbaras has formed a task force that will focus on intensified information campaign.
Esmeralda, who is a medical doctor by profession, emphasized the need for the people to get proper and reliable information from those who are in the medical profession including nurses and not from unreliable sources.“We might have to do a house-to-house campaign and explain the scientific basis of vaccines,” Esmeralda added.

The country is having difficulty getting more supplies of coronavirus vaccines even if the government would “buy, steal, or borrow,” according to President Duterte.

The President acknowledged that the world’s supply of life-saving vaccines remained thin especially after many rich nations have reportedly cornered the bulk of the stocks of the vaccines.
“Hindi ako puwedeng magsinungaling bobolahin kayo eh (I cannot lie to you or deceive you),” Duterte said during a televised address Monday, March 1.“Wala talagang supply (There is really no supply). I’d like to say it in — my dear countrymen, ginusto ko man, sabi ko, buy, steal, or borrow, wala akong makuha (I can’t get anymore),” he added.
Given the limited global supply of vaccines, the President pointed out that country was in the same boat as most nations facing difficulty in vaccine procurement.
Duterte previously said the nation would just have to wait for the vaccines after 10 rich countries have acquired 75 percent of the world’s supply of coronavirus vaccines.United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres earlier criticized the unfair distribution of the vaccines, after 10 nations administered most of the supply.
“Walang bakuna ngayon available, either hingiin mo, nakawin mo o bayaran mo (There is no vaccine available — either you beg, steal or pay for it),” Duterte said.
“Not only the Philippines, as stated by earlier — binigyan tayo ng worldwide situation ng vaccine. Hirap rin sila. Ang Amerika mayroon pero inuuna nila (We have a worldwide situation on vaccine. They’re having a hard time too. America has supplies but they’re scrambling for them),” he said.
The President however said the country managed to secure initial vaccine supply, citing efforts of the team led by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.
He also expressed appreciation anew to China for augmenting the country’s supply with the donation of 600,000 doses of vaccines developed by Sinovac. The supply was delivered to the country last Sunday, which paved the way for the vaccine rollout the next day.“It is only China who has come up with its commitment to so many nations,” he said.

“As humanly possible, we would like to, I said, distribute it among the Filipino people across the nation,” the President said during his televised address Monday, March 1.The President made the pronouncement after vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. reported that the country would receive 161 million doses of vaccines before the end of the year.Of the forthcoming vaccines, Galvez said 20 million doses, including those coming from World Health Organization’s COVAX facility, are expected to be delivered to the country in the second quarter of the year.
Among the suppliers are Novavax and AstraZeneca. By the third quarter, Galvez said the country could expect the arrival of 68 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. An additional 69 million vaccines doses will be delivered to the country by the fourth quarter of the year.
“All in all po, Mr. President, Mr. Mayor, ay mayroon po tayong 161 million doses kasama na po iyong 44 million na COVAX (All in all, Mr. President, Mr. Mayor, we have 161 million doses including 44 million from COVAX),” Galvez said during a meeting with the President and other government officials on pandemic response.
Galvez, also chief implementer of the government’s program in battling the pandemic, also assured the public that they would implement an “equitable distribution” the vaccines across regions. 
Of the vaccine supply, Galvez said 130,000 doses will be set aside for National Capital Region, epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
Other regions, especially those with reported increase in cases of infections, will also receive vaccine allocation from the government.
The government has launched its vaccination campaign Monday in a bid to boost public protection after the pandemic infected over half a million people and weakened the local economy in recent months.The first batch of the Sinovac vaccines donated by China arrived in Manila last Sunday.
The government aims to vaccinate 70 million citizens this year to attain herd immunity but recent polls indicated vaccine hesitancy among some peopleover safety concerns.The President earlier assured the public of the government’s resolve to ensure a timely vaccine rollout to overcome the health crisis and “enables us to confidently reopen our society.”“We cannot afford to waste time or resources in the distribution of these vaccines because we are dealing with precious lives,” he said in his remarks after welcoming the vaccine arrival over the weekend.

“The Philippines is going to receive both AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines through the COVAX facility,” said WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe in an interview on CNN Philippines on Tuesday, March 2.
The Philippine government has already complied with all the necessary requirements to have access on these vaccines, said Abeyasinghe.
“The requirements relating to AstraZeneca have been completed…Having said that, we are also informed that all requirements that the Philippines was required to meet with regards to Pfizer vaccines have been completed, but access to Pfizer vaccines may be delayed,” he said.Abeyasinghe said that they are looking at how they can accelerate the deliveryof the 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines. These vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1.“Although AstraZeneca was tentatively scheduled on Monday, this was not possible and we now believe that we will hear of a possible date…I don’t want to create any expectations until we have a firm date. So when we know of a firm date and which we believe will be very soon, we will announce that,” said Abeyasinghe.
“The consignments are ready and just logistics arrangements are being made. So once we have a finalization and a confirmed itinerary of the delivery, we will share that information,” he added.
At the global level, Abeyasinghe said that they are facing two bottlenecks in the delivery of the essential vaccines around the globe.“The (first) bottleneck that we are talking of was the manufacturers unable to meet the manufacturing targets because these are biological processes and they could not produce the quantities that they anticipated that they could early on,” said the WHO official.“We are now seeing a second bottleneckthat is the delivery processes because these vaccines need to be transported: maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world,” he said.
“There are 190 countries who have signed on to the COVAX and who are anticipating vaccines, and now this is posing a challenge,” he added.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

CEBU CITY—The so-called social media influencers were asked to help boost the vaccination campaign in the Visayas.
The Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV) said these social media influencers will play a key role in helping increase the confidence in COVID-19 vaccines.
One of those who committed to help push the government’s vaccination campaign was Jess Labares, a transgender beauty queen.“I really do believe in this vaccination push and the vaccine brands that our government is procuring. We have to trust the process. We have to trust our government,” Labares said in an online show hosted by OPAV Assistant Secretary Anthony Gerard Gonzales.
Labares is considered a trailblazer in the LGBTQIA+ community for being the first transwoman flight attendant of local airline Cebu Pacific.
Labares expressed willingness to get vaccinated if only to help boost the confidence of the public to take the vaccine.
“I’d be willing to get vaccinated. I want to become an example to ease the hesitation of other people in getting a vaccine or not. This is really important because this will help us become immune to this virus,” said Labares, a physical therapy graduate of the Cebu Doctors’ University.Aside from boosting the confidence in the vaccines, Gonzales said social media influencers can also help minimize the disinformation going around about COVID-19 vaccines.
“We need to boost this advocacy to encourage the Visayan community and the Cebuano community to believe in vaccination because this is a crucial step taken by our government as we gradually reopen our economy,” Gonzales said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

As the government kicked off the vaccination drive, the President said he respects the “right” of health professionals to choose the vaccine brand.
At least 600,000 doses of vaccines developed by Sinovac Biotech have been donated by China to the Philippines. The country’s immunization drive kicked off Monday, a day after these Chinese vaccines, the country’s first supply, arrived in Manila.“Even the doctors, some are not quite keen sa Sinovac but that’s their right. They want maybe the US. It could be AstraZeneca, it could be Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson is US talaga ‘yan. It could be Moderna…Wala kaming objections diyan kung ayaw ninyo (We have no objection to that),” the President said during his televised address Monday, March 1.
According to the President, the health workers could wait to get inoculated if they refuse to take the Sinovac vaccine.“Maghintay na lang kayo pag magdating ng bakuna (You may wait for the arrival of the vaccine) of your choice and not the ones being applied now to the people,” Duterte said.
“We respect your decision on the matter,” he added.The country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier allowed the emergency use of the Sinovac vaccines in the country. The vaccine however has been not been recommended to health workers exposed to COVID-19 patients due to its varying efficacy levels.The local drug regulator later clarified that this was only a recommendation, adding the health workers may still receive the vaccine if they want.
The Palace earlier disclosed that the President was “perplexed” after the FDA advised against the use of the Sinovac vaccine on health workers.Duterte even summoned FDA chief Rolando Enrique Domingo to the Palace to explain such “colatilla” on the Sinovac vaccine even though the World Health Organization laid down the 50 percent minimum threshold of vaccine efficacy.
The President has passed up the chance to get vaccinated with Sinovac drug and decided to wait for the arrival of another Chinese-developed brand. Duterte, 75, said his doctor advised him on the vaccine brand suitable for his advanced age. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“Given that a surge in the NCR is now not a question of if but of how much, we exhort the government to ensure the urgent but efficient deployment of vaccines in the next two weeks,” the group said in its report on Monday, March 1.
“We hope the national government, in coordination with the LGUs, will ensure that our health workers in the NCR and nearby provinces would be vaccinated together with the other front liners identified as a priority by the national vaccination program,” it added.Moreover, given that a surge of new cases in the NCR is anticipated in the next few weeks and could possibly overwhelm its health care system and its workers, the OCTA Research Team encouraged health workers in the NCR and in the adjacent provinces, together with the other front liners identified as a priority by the national vaccination program, to get themselves vaccinated.“There is a very small window of opportunity for health workers in the NCR to get vaccinated while the surge is still in its early stages and hospital occupancy in the region is still manageable,” it said.
“Our healthcare workers in the region must seize this opportunity,” it added.
In its report, OCTA pointed out that the reproduction number in NCR has increased to 1.5 as the region registered 1,022 new COVID-19 cases on February 27.
“The four-day average was 942, while the seven-day average was 762, which is an increase of 61 percent from the previous week and 94 percent from two weeks ago,” it said.
The group noted that the pattern of increase in NCR is similar to the patterns observed in Cebu City, Mountain Province and Benguet, where the SARS-Cov2 variants were identified.
“The positivity rate in NCR increased to an average of 6 percent over the past seven days, based on 18,000 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests per day.

Pharmacists and midwives may be tapped to administer COVID-19 vaccines in the country under Republic Act No. 11525 signed by President Duterte.
President Rodrigo Roa Duterte
The new law, also known as “COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021,” included a provision on licensed pharmacists and midwives as “vaccinators.”These health professionals must be trained by the Department of Health (DOH) for the government’s COVID-19 immunization drive.
The government earlier disclosed plan to vaccinate up to 70 million people this year in a bid to reach herd immunity against the new coronavirus disease.“Notwithstanding the provision of Section 4 (g) of Republic Act No. 10918, otherwise known as the ‘Philippine Pharmacy Act’, and Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7392 otherwise known as the ‘Philippine Midwifery Act of 1992’ and in furtherance of the COVID-19 Vaccination Program, licensed pharmacists and midwives who are duly trained by the DOH may administer COVID-19 vaccines,” the law read.
The COVID-19 vaccines must be registered with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or possess an emergency use authorization (EUA), according to RA 11525.
Section 4 (g) of the country’s pharmacy law refers to the administration of FDA-approved vaccines provided pharmacists undergo training on vaccine administration and management of adverse impact. They must also hold a certificate of training issued by an institution duly accredited by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC).
Under the country’s midwivery law, the practice of midwivery covers not only providing services related to supervision care of women during pregnancy and deliveries but also health education of the patient, family and community; and primary health care services in the community including giving immunization.The health department earlier backed the recommendations to pharmacists and midwives to boost the ranks of vaccinators in the country.
RA 11525, signed by the President on Feb. 26, also included the creation of a P500-million COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund that will be administered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.The same law provides “immunity from liability” of public officials and employees, contractors, manufacturers, volunteers, and representatives of private entities involved in the vaccination program in case of claims from vaccine administration or use except arising from “willful misconduct and gross negligence.”Some vaccine makers earlier sought legal protection from any lawsuit in case a person suffers adverse side effects after taking the COVID-19 shot. The indemnity requirement resulted in the delay in the delivery of the Pfizer vaccines under the COVAX facility to the country. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Republic Act No. 11525, also known as “COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021,” has directed the Department of Health (DOH) to maintain a central database of vaccinations and mandates a uniform format for the vaccine cards.
The COVID-19 vaccine cards, which will include the name, address, birthdays, and vaccination information of vaccine recipients, will be subject to the provisions of the country’s data privacy law.
Such vaccine cards however will not be an “additional mandatory requirement” for educational, employment, and the government transaction purposes, according to RA 11525.
“The DOH shall issue a vaccine card to all persons vaccinated. To fast track the process, the DOH may delegate the processing and issuance of vaccine cards to LGUs and private entities, subject to guidelines to the promulgated by the DOH,” the law read.The vaccine card, which could either be digital or printed card, will contain the following information:
– basic personal information such as full name, present and/or permanent address, and birthdate;– manufacturer, brand name, and batch number or other identifier of the COVID-19 vaccine;
– date of vaccination;
– name of hospital, health center or health facility where the vaccine was received;– name, signature, license number of the duly licensed physician, nurse or other health worker administering the vaccine;
– date of the last RT-PCR testing and the name of the laboratory; and,
– other information that may be determined as necessary by the Health Secretary or the government pandemic task force
Under the law, the DOH, through the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), must develop the LGU-based digital systems and applications that will meet the objectives of the COVID-19 Vaccination Program while maintaining quality, safety, ease of use, and accessibility for all Filipinos.
The contents of the vaccine card will be updated accordingly to conform with globally acceptable standards.“Individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 as indicated in the vaccine card shall not be considered immune from COVID-19, unless otherwise declared by the DOH based on reliable scientific evidence and consensus,” the law read.
RA 11525 also said no fees will be collected for the issuance, amendment, or replacement of a vaccine card. The amount for the implementation of the vaccine cards will be charged against available government funds.
Any person who falsifies a vaccine card may face punishment under the Revised Penal Code.
The same new law, signed by the President on Feb. 26, facilitates the swift procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines by the local government units (LGUs) as well as the establishment of the P500-million indemnity fund. the law takes effect immediately upon publication in a newspaper or the Official Gazette.
The measure will remain in effect during the state of calamity declared by the President last September. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Alliance of Health Workers (AHW) on Monday, March 1, expressed disappointment at the government’s decision to allowingthe vaccination of healthcare workers with China’s Sinovac coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine.
(JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“We are dismayed at the sudden turn around decision of the government to inoculate health workers with Sinovac, sacrificing the health and safety of the health workers,” said AHW President Robert Mendoza in a statement.“The government should not pass on to us the burden of public trust on vaccination, because it’s the government’s responsibility to the people to give the best vaccine and ensure the safety and efficacy and it should be consistent and transparent to the people,” he added. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Sinovac vaccines last Feb. 22, but it was not recommending the use of the China-made vaccine to medical frontliners who were attending to COVID-19 patients due to its low efficacy rate of 50.4 percent.
However, the National Immunization Technical Advisory (NITAG) has recommended the use of Sinovac vaccines for healthcare workers, citing its safety and efficacy to reduce mortality.“Due to the ever-changing government’s pronouncements, we health workers doubted of what is behind the government’s insistence for the Sinovac vaccine. There are better options for vaccine that have the highest efficacy rate. Why the donation CoronaVac with a low efficacy rate is being forced by the government to be vaccinated to us health workers and the people?,” he added.The group stood firm“on their demand for a free, safest and most efficacious COVID-19 vaccine for all because they believe that health workers’ and people’s lives matter most.”
“Many from our ranks have been infected and some died in combating the deadly virus. Our health and lives are always at stake, it is just right and humane that we demand the free, safest and most efficacious vaccine,” said Eleazar Sobinsky, president of the Lung Center of the Philippines Employees Association- Alliance of Health Workers (LCPEA-AHW).“As we go along with the entire vaccination program, we demand for a free treatment and hospitalization for immunized health workers experiencing adverse side effects, that we should also receive our compensation while undergoing treatment or hospitalization,” he said.Sobinsky called on the government to indemnify health workers who suffer severe side effects or worse, death due to COVID vaccines amounting to not less than P1 million.
“Lastly, we want the government and health authorities to be held accountable in indemnifying victims of severe effect of the vaccine.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“Once na mabakunahan ka ng Sinovac, by the time na dumating yung Pfizer or other better vaccines hindi ka na maaaring magpabakuna ng iba pang vaccine (Once you get vaccinated by Sinovac, by the time the Pfizer or other better vaccines arrive, you will not be able to get another vaccine),” he added.Last week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authority (EUA) for the COVID-19 vaccine of China’s Sinovac Biotech.
FDA Director General Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that all conditions for an EUA were present and the benefits of using the vaccine outweigh the known and potential risks.
He said interim data also showed that when the vaccine is used on clinically healthy members of a community aged 18 to 59, it has an efficacy rate of 65.3 to 91.2 percent.
However, he said, it has a lower efficacy rate of 50.4 percent when used on healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19.On Monday, the government conducted the kickoff of the vaccination drive in the country.
Among the hospitals in Metro Manila that received the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. was Philippine General Hospital (PGH).

Glovax Biotech, a Filipino-owned vaccine distributor and proponent of the P7-billion vaccine manufacturing venture, is looking to supply 40 million doses of next generation COVID-19 vaccines from Korea 50 percent cheaper than what is currently being offered by vaccine producers.
Glovax Biotech President Giovanni Alingod announced during a briefing that he has already informed government officials, including Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the Philippines’ Declared National Policy Against COVID-19, of the available vaccine supply called EuCorVac-19 of Eubiologics from South Korea.
Glovax Biotech President Giovanni Alingod
He explained that the EuCorVac-19 of Eubiologics was developed in Western New York, USA by POP Biotechnologies and has been approved for Human Clinical Trials. The South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety also approved the combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials last January 2021. The firm is just awaiting the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Authority (EUA) for the mass production of the next generation vaccines in South Korea.
For the Philippine supply, Alingod said Glovax and Eubiologics are also in the process of applying for an EUA from the Food and Drugs Administration. Should they get the EUA by May this year and successfully convince the government to order the 40 million doses, Alingod said they can bring in the next generation EuCorVac-19 vaccines over a period of six months.He said Eubiologics can only produce 100 million doses annually in South Korea but because of its long established partnership, Glovax was able to secure 40 million doses. In fact, he said, other countries are asking South Korea to supply them with the vaccines at higher prices.
But for the Philippines, he said, “It will be 50 percent cheaper than the first generation COVID-19 vaccines.” While the price is not yet revealed, Alingod noted that the vaccine being offered now by the first generation manufacturers costs between P3,600 to P3,900 a dose.Glovax, the only vaccine-focused Filipino pharmaceutical distributor in the country, has partnerships with Korean firm Eubiologics since 2017 and LG Chem in 2005. These two firms are World Health Organization (WHO) Pre-Qualified Vaccine manufacturers.
Alingod said they have approached the SM Group for a partnership that will allow the use for free a space in their malls as vaccination centers for their host local government units.
Alingod, however, said that the proposed vaccine manufacturing plant announced last Feb. 22, is tied with the Philippine government’s purchase of 40 million doses of EuCorVac-19 vaccines. This means the ambitious project may only be pursued if government purchases the 40 million doses of EuCorVac-19.
According to Alingod, the vaccine plant will produce the next generation COVID-19 vaccine and the Pentavalent Vaccine in partnership with Eubiologics and LG Chem, respectively. The plant will ensure that the Philippines has a vaccine manufacturing capability and a facility that could be used for vaccine production in case of new pandemics in the future.
They are reportedly in talks with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Board of Investments and the National Development Company, the investment arm of the DTI, for possible funding or minority equity share in the construction of the first ever vaccine plant in the Philippines.
There are also other foreign groups interested to help put up the facility, which should be in an economic zone near an international airport. They are initially looking at Clark Special Economic Zone.Alingod, who reportedly started his company by selling his wedding gifts, justified the P7 billion Next Generation COVID Vaccine plant. He said the P7 billion investment includes the construction and the technology transfer costs.The planned vaccine manufacturing plant, he said is a complete technology transfer from Korea and the US from active pharmaceutical ingredients up to formulation and capable of producingany vaccine for new pandemics that may come in the future and make the Philippines self reliant.
“Hopefully Eubiologics can help in vaccinating Filipinos and if takes years to vaccinate we can shorten the timeframe if can have own vaccine plant,” he stressed. Should the plan push through, he expects start of construction within the year.“It is estimated that the world could vaccinate all its population in 7 years and the local vaccine plant can help reduce that timeframe especially for the Philippines. This will be the legacy of our President Rodrigo Duterte as it will be in partnership with the DTI, BOI, NDC, Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology, and IATF, among different government agencies.”
As traditional vaccine manufacturers, Alingod said that Eubiologics and LG Chem have already produced vaccines in the past that were used by UNICEF, unlike other COVID vaccine manufacturers.
And as producer of Next Generation COVID vaccine, he said EuCorVac-19 would be more effective to fight the newer COVID strains and other mutations unlike the first generation COVID vaccines which are only 22 percent effective against the new South African strain and other new strains found around the world.
The next generation COVID vaccine can also be stored up to 25°C or room temperature up to 3 months and 2°C to 8°C for longer period, unlike the first generation of COVID vaccines which requires freezing temperature that the Philippinesis not well-equipped with.
According to Alingod, Glovax is the first and only vaccine company to bring in the first pandemic vaccine in 2009/2010 during the AH1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic.“If anyone could remember, there was also a shortage of the Pandemic Vaccine during the AH1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic,” he said. “With this experience, the proposed vaccine plant can avert the current and future pandemic.”
Since 2003, Glovax had brought in more 5 million vaccine doses of various types of vaccines, including Polio, Tuberculosis, Measles, Tetanus, Pentavalent, and Rabies. It is the only vaccine-focused company in the Philippines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Dr. Alfonso Famaran received the first dose of China’s Sinovac vaccine shortly after 9:30 a.m. and said he did not feel any pain while being inoculated.
“The best comparison dito is…pneumococcal vaccine. Yung pneumococcal vaccine, 30 minutes after, meron ng pain sa injection site. Itong Sinovac, wala eh (With the pneumococcal vaccine, after 30 minutes, I felt pain in the injection site. But with Sinovac, none),” Famaran told reporters after his inoculation.“Tapos yung entry ng vaccine…itong Sinovac [di ko napansin]…tapos na pala. Wala akong naramdaman kasi nilagyan nalang ng band-aid (I also didn’t notice the entry of the Sinovac needle. I was surprised that it’s already done. I did not feel anything until I realized that they were already putting band-aid on my shoulder),” he added.
Since he is allergic to penicillin and seafood, the hospital’s medical chief said, he had to be monitored for 30 minutes until he was cleared of possible adverse effects.
Testing Czar Sec. Vince Dizon, who also was present in the rollout and received a vaccine shot, agreed with Famaran.
“Lahat ng sinabi ni Doc, ‘yun din naramdaman ko (I also experienced what Dr. Famaran experienced),” he said, “Mas masakit yung flu vaccine. Doon, medyo nakaramdam ako ng sakit. Dito wala akong naramdaman at all (Flu vaccine, for me, is more painful. When I got vaccinated against the flu, I felt a bit of pain. But with COVID, I didn’t feel anything at all).”Famaran and Dizon were only among the dozens of frontliners from DJNRMC who received the first dose of vaccine against COVID-19, which arrived in the country on Sunday, Feb. 28.
The rollout, which was also led by Caloocan Mayor Oca Malapitan and Department of Health Assistant Secretary Elmer Punzalan, started at around 9 a.m. But by 12 noon, there were hardly any frontliners lined up for vaccination.
A personnel at the registration site told reporters that more were expected to come by late afternoon.178 Sinovac volunteers
In an interview with reporters, Famaran said that only 178 of the hospital’s 1,111 priority workers volunteered to get the Chinese vaccine.
Asked why only a small number of the hospital’s workers wanted Sinovac, Famaran said, this is because the vaccine has less acceptance rate among their employees.
“Ang expected kasi namin is Pfizer-BioNTech, so…mataas yung vaccine acceptance noon sa hospital na ‘to: 95 percent (We were expecting that Pfizer-BioNTech would arrive first. So it has a high acceptance rate of 95 percent),” he said.
“Well informed sila sa data eh (Because workers here are well-informed with the data), when it comes to Pfizer-BioNTech,” he added.But both Famaran and Dizon maintained that the Chinese vaccine has “100 percent” efficacy rate or “percentage of protection,” particularly against getting severe cases of COVID-19.
“Ang healthcare worker, kapag sya’y nabakunahan ng Sinovac, 100 percent or sigurado syang hindi magkakaroon ng severe COVID-19 (If a healthcare workers is already vaccinated with Sinovac, it os 100 percent sure that he will no longer experience severe COVID-19 case),” Dizon said.
Sinovac has 60-70 percent protection against moderate cases, and 50 percent against mild cases, the testing czar added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Filipinos were urged to get the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, including China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd., as soon as possible since it is a moral obligation that needs to be fulfilled to collectively defeat the threat of the pandemic, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said Monday, March 1, as the country officially began its rollout of the vaccination program.

Galvez, the vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19, led the symbolic vaccination at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) in Manila where he vowed to take the Sinovac jab himself after all healthcare workers were vaccinated against COVID-19 in adherence to the government’s priority list.
“We will not be able to go to the ‘new normal’ way of our lives and our economy will not recover if we won’t be vaccinated. Getting vaccinated is a moral obligation of all people,” he said.Galvez said that the public should no longer wait for the “best vaccine,” seemingly referring to other brands with higher efficacy ratings.
“There is no such thing as ‘best vaccine’ because the best vaccine is the one that is safe, effective, and readily available to us now. What importance will it be if there is a vaccine that has a high efficacy rating but will come in the third quarter? We should get whatever vaccine arrives first,” he noted.
Sinovac reportedly registered an efficacy rate of 65.3 to 91.2 percent based on vaccinations in Indonesia and Turkey although it had a lower rating of 50.4 percent when administered to healthcare workers in Brazil.
In the first quarter of 2021, Galvez said around 5.1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be delivered in the country including one million doses of Sinovac jabs that are set to arrive in March alone.Also included in the shipment are 3.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines from the Covax facility, of which the first batch consisted of 525,600 doses was originally scheduled to be delivered on March 1 but was delayed by one week due to supply shortage and logistical problems.
“After this [rollout], the supply of vaccines will start coming in. We will try to get all the available vaccines that we can and give it to our healthcare workers. Our pledge is to finish the vaccination of all healthcare workers in March,” Galvez said.
Aside from the vaccination at the PGH, similar vaccinations were also held at the Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital, and V.

Duque led the symbolic vaccination program at the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) in Quezon City.He administered the Sinovac vaccine toDr. Eileen Aniceto, 59, department manager of LCP’s Emergency Medicine and Outpatient Department. Aniceto is the first recipient of the Sinovac vaccine in LCP.
The symbolic program was also simultaneously done in five other hospitals namely: Philippine General Hospital in Manila, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center in Caloocan City, Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City, Philippine National Police General Hospital in Quezon City, and the Victoriano Luna Medical Center in Quezon City.“Dumaan sa napakahigpit at masusing pagsusuri, ito po ay ginamit na pinakamataas na pamantayan or standards of safety first of all (and) efficacy, and quality. So, huwag po tayong mag-alinlangan (It went through a very strict and thorough review, it has high standards of safety, efficacy, and quality. So, let us not doubt [this vaccine]),” said Duque.
“Ito pong bakunang ito ay 100 percent safe in preventing severe COVID infection. Iyon naman po ang ating hangad a maiwasan ang severe infection from COVID-19 (This vaccine is 100 percent safe in preventing severe COVID infection, which is our goal—- to prevent severe infection from COVID-19),” he added.
On Monday, 20 healthcare workers of the LCP will get vaccinated using the Sinovac vaccine, said LCP Director Vincent Balanag.
“We are confident that after this, marami pang susunod. We have received as much as 600 doses initially. We hope to finish this within the week,” he said. The LCP has a total of 1,250 personnel.Duque said that the vaccination will help boost the country’s economy. “I call on everyone to get vaccinated. This is the time.Dr. Anthony Fauci said that ‘the best vaccine is the one that is currently available.’ And what is the currently available vaccine? We only have Sinovac. Let us support it,” said Duque.

Instead of getting the Sinovac vaccine donated by China, President Duterte has requested another brand of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine for him, his family, and possibly for some Cabinet members.

The President admitted seeking a “personal” supply of vaccines after expressing readiness to be inoculated to enhance protection against the new coronavirus disease.
Duterte however did not identify the brand but the Palace previously mentioned he prefers to be injected with a vaccine developed by China’s Sinopharm. The 75-year-old leader earlier disclosed that his doctor has advised him to wait for a specific vaccine brand due to his old age.“Ako, naghingi ako, personal. Wala silang stock na ano eh. Naghingi ako para sa pamilya ko pati sa akin (I asked for a personal supply. There is no stock yet. I asked for vaccines for family and me),” Duterte said during a press conference Sunday, Feb. 28, after welcoming the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by China to the country
“I don’t know if we would have enough vaccines for everybody but I think I can accommodate the — itong Cabinet members,” he added during the turnover ceremony held at the Villamor Airbase in Pasay City.
The President is not among the first recipients of the Sinovac vaccines given by China as he waits for the other Chinese brand recommended by his doctor.
“My doctor has in mind. It’s a Chinese brand still pero hindi ito. Siya ‘yong nakaalam ng constitution ng katawan ko (It’s a Chinese brand but it’s not this. My doctors know the constitution of my body),” he said.The President made the remarks a few days after former special envoy to China Ramon Tulfo revealed Duterte’s preference for the Sinopharm vaccine. The newspaper columnist also bared he arranged a phone call between the President and a Sinopharm representative and that the former asked for vaccines for him and his family.
Sinopharm has yet to secure an emergency use approval for its vaccines in the country. The Food and Drug Administration however allowed the Presidential Security Group to secure Sinopharm vaccines under a compassionate use license. The Palace earlier said the legal team was studying if the President can get the Sinopharm vaccine under such compassionate use permit.
Even though he won’t get the Sinovac vaccine, the President tried to assure the public that such a vaccine is effective in preventing coronavirus illness.“I am giving the guarantee that it is effective. That efficacy is good,” he said.
Duterte also encouraged people to get vaccinated, telling them to get their doctor’s advice on which vaccine to take.
“Ngayon, ‘yong ayaw magpabakuna, wala akong magawa para sa inyo (Now, to those who refused to be vaccinated, I can’t do anything for you) or you might want at least you know in your lifetime, may kilala kang doktor, magtanong ka na lang sa doktor kung anong mabuti sa iyo (if you know a doctor, ask the doctor what will be good for you),” he said.
He noted that although senior citizens like him are “discouraged” from getting the vaccine, he is prepared to get vaccinated. “Pero ako, since I get to go around and meet people to travel, baka kailangan ko (I might need it),” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement as the government Philippines finally started vaccinating healthcare workers against COVID-19 at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) in Manila.
In his speech, Roque pointed out that March 1, 2021, was a historic day for the Philippines.“Ang gagawin po natin dito sa PGH at iba pang pampublikong hospital dito sa Metro Manila ay pagsimula po ng pag-asa na matapos po ang halos isang taon ng kadiliman dahil sa COVID-19, narito na po ang liwanang (What we will be doing here at the PGH and other public hospitals in Metro Manila is the start of our hope that after almost one year of darkness due to COVID-19, here comes the light),” he said.
Roque thanked health workers for their sacrifices throughout the pandemic and pointed out that they are the real heroes during this crisis.
“Nagpapasalamat din po ako sa ngalan po ng Presidente natin at ng sambayanang Pilipino sa lahat ng medical frontliners kayo po ang tunay na bayani sa panahon ng COVID-19 (On behalf of the President and the Filipino people, we thank the medical frontliners. You are the real heroes during this pandemic),” he said.
“At dahil kayo po ang ating tunay na bayani, tama lang po na kayo po ang mauna sa COVID-19 [vaccine]. Ito po ay pagpapakita ng aming pasasalamat at utang na loob (And since you are our true heroes, it’s only appropriate that you are vaccinated first. This is our way of showing gratitude to our healthcare workers),” he added.The Philippines rolled out the vaccination program with the CoronaVac vaccine manufactured by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac. The first to be vaccinated was PGH director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi on Monday morning.
The Chinese government has donated 600,000 doses of CoronaVac after an emergency use authorization (EUA) was issued to Sinovac by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week. The EUA, however, did not recommend the Sinovac vaccine to be administered to healthcare workers and senior citizens.
Healthcare workers have expressed their misgivings about the CoronaVac, noting the 50.4-percent efficacy rate for medical frontliners. President Duterte assured health workers that they are free to wait for their preferred vaccine brand without them losing their priority status.The Philippines is set to receive 525,600 doses of British-Swedish vaccine AstraZeneca from the COVAX Facility within the month.

Four million doses of the latest Covid-19 vaccine to get US approval will be delivered across the country as early as Tuesday, a senior administration official said.
The United States on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson’s Covid vaccine for emergency use, boosting President Joe Biden’s plan to battle the outbreak that has killed more than 500,000 Americans.
The single-shot vaccine — the third type to be authorized — is highly effective in preventing severe Covid-19, including against newer variants, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said before giving it a green light.“Starting tonight, 3.9 million doses of J&J will be distributed across all channels — states, tribes, territories, and pharmacies and community health centers. Those J&J doses will be delivered as early as this Tuesday morning,” the administration official said Sunday on a call with reporters.
“That’s the entirety of J&J’s current inventory,” the official added. “J&J expects to deliver approximately 16 million additional doses by the end of March. So that’s a cumulative 20 million.”
The J&J vaccine is the third to be greenlighted in the United States after Pfizer’s and Moderna’s were provisionally approved in December.
Over 65 million people in America have so far received at least one shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines — but unlike those, the J&J vaccine requires just one dose, and is stored at fridge temperatures, offering logistical and practical advantages.The J&J shot appears less protective than Pfizer and Moderna’s two-shot regimens, which both have an efficacy of around 95 percent against all forms of Covid-19 from the classic coronavirus strain.
In large clinical trials, the J&J vaccine’s efficacy against severe disease was 85.9 percent in the United States, 81.7 percent in South Africa, and 87.6 percent in Brazil.
Overall, among 39,321 participants across all regions, the efficacy against severe Covid-19 was 85.4 percent, but it fell to 66.1 percent when including moderate forms of the disease.All three vaccines have been shown to fully protect against hospitalizations and death, however.
J&J had earlier announced it aims to deliver 20 million doses by the end of March, with 100 million by June — though the US is pushing to expedite that timeline. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Duterte made the statement as he personally welcomed the Sinovac vaccines donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines at the Villamor Airbase in Pasay City on Sunday, February 28.
In his speech during the ceremony, Duterte told Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian that he wants to fly to China just to express his gratitude to President Xi.“Mr. Ambassador, I’d like to just say that towards the — maybe at the end of the year, when everything has settled down — I intend to make a short visit to China to just shake hands with President Xi Jinping and to personally thank him for this donation. Thank you,” he said.
In a press conference after the event, the President said he wants to go to Beijing even if it would only be a one-day trip.
“If I have to travel to China– even one day– just to tell President Xi Jinping, ‘Thank you, and then I go home,” he said. The President likewise pointed out that China has donated vaccines to many countries but the Philippines was the only country where China made a personal delivery.“China has donated several vaccines to several countries. But it is only the donation made to the Philippines that was carried by a Chinese government plane,” Duterte said.
“Iyong iba kinukuha doon sa China. Dito, hinatid sa atin (Other countries had to get the vaccines from China but China delivered the vaccines to us),” he added.
In honor of his motherDuring the press conference, President Duterte said he would want to visit Fujian Normal University, the school that dedicated a college and a building to his late mother Soledad before going to Beijing to meet Xi.
“My mother was one of the first educators of the Chinese school in Davao… So in China, they have a building named after my mother. So I’d like to go to Xiamen before going to Beijing,” he said.

The Philippines should work to build an environment that will make its health care workers stay rather than leave, Vice President and opposition leader Leni Robredo said on Sunday.
Vice President Leni Robredo (JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Robredo was reacting to Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello’s request for vaccines from the United Kingdom and Germany in exchange for the deployment of more nurses there.The vice president raised how it is disheartening for government officials to treat Filipino nurses as commodities.“Medyo nakakalungkot ‘yun kasi parang ganoon na ba tayo ka-desperate, na alam ko desperate na tayo for vaccine pero huwag naman at the expense of our workers, di ba (It’s sad because are we that desperate? I know we are desperate for a vaccine but not at the expense of our workers),” Robredo said during her weekly radio show, “BISErbisyong Leni.”
Fortunately, both countries already said they will not enter into an agreement that will send Filipino nurses in exchange for COVID-19 jabs.Various health workers’ groups criticized Bello over the week over his offer to deploy more nurses to the United Kingdom and Germany in exchange for COVID-19 vaccines.This was after British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce requested to hire more Filipino nurses because of the pandemic. The Philippine government has set a 5,000-cap on the number of nurses who can be deployed overseas due to the outbreak of the pandemic.
Germany made a similar request to hire more Filipino nurses, but Bello said he hasn’t talked to the German ambassador in Manila yet.“Our target should be to improve the environment here for our health workers so they won’t need to leave,” Robredo said in Filipino.
Although a lot of people agree that health workers are the “heroes” of the pandemic, Robredo asked how the government is treating them.
If the government is recognizing their sacrifices, it should protect them with just compensation and addressing their other needs.“We should look at how we are treating them, so they don’t need to leave,” the vice president said.
“Our gratitude to them should not only be in words. We should let them feel we are grateful. They will feel such gratitude if we take care of their needs,” Robredo noted. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Go, who chairs the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, made the assurance as the government gears for the arrival of the first batch of Sinovac vaccines on Feb. 28 and AstraZeneca on Monday, March 1.
The senator also said the government is simultaneously ensuring the safety and efficacy of the procured vaccines.“This is just the start. We need to do more. We need to accelerate the vaccination program in a safe, sure and secure manner,” Go said in an interview on Net 25.
According to Go, President Duterte has ordered that the vaccines be distributed to strategic places particularly in the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City and at the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City.
“The President wants the vaccines distributed all over the country,” Go said adding that the Chief Executive has also ordered the first round of vaccinations to begin by the first week of March.
However, details of the vaccine rollout would be provided in due course by National Task Force Against COVID-19 and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr., Go said.He also said the President has ordered the government task force against COVID-19 to follow the priority list.
“In fact, this 100,000 Sinovac would be given to soldiers and civilian employees of the Department of National Defense (DND). The Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) is now ready to conduct the vaccination,” he stressed.
Go also said the President is willing to revisit his decision to reject the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) to place the country under modified general community quarantine or MGCQ.“What is important right now is we work as a team—Executive, Legislative and Judiciary. What is very important right now is the roll out of the vaccines,” he said. “That’s the only key solution to our problem right now,” Go stressed.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Bureau of Customs (BOC) Deputy Commissioner Vincent Philip Maronilla answered this question in a DZBB radio interview Sunday morning, Feb.28.
According to Maronilla, customs agents will first get an opportunity to count the number of vaccines received by the country from importers during then handling of the jabs at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City.“Pagdating po ng RITM nandun po mga customs officers namin para lang po tignan yung paglipat niya sa doon cold storage facility.

On Monday, March 1, 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines will be flown into the Philippines.
Maronilla said the same process would be observed for both vaccine brands.
He reiterated that the BOC has done advanced processing on the vaccines, which are considered government imports. This will allow the items to forego the usual process of opening the boxes for inspection and even x-ray examination.“Hindi po pwedeng buksan yung shipment na ito, hindi rin po siya pwedeng idaan nga sa x-ray kahit ano klaseng examination (We aren’t allowed to open this shipment, and we can’t conduct x-ray or any type of examination on it),” he said.

Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian had earlier said the donated vaccine doses to the Philippines are part of the friendship and partnership between the two countries. “It is a fine tradition between China and the Philippines to help each other in trying times. A friend in need is a friend indeed,” he said.
‘Sinovac use in PH’
Sinovac’s CoronaVac was issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Feb. 22.
It is the third vaccine to be granted an EUA in the Philippines after Pfizer’s Comirnaty and AstraZeneca’s AZD1222.The FDA said the vaccine is recommended to be administered only to healthy individuals 18 to 59 years old, but not to senior citizens and medical frontliners, stating that it’s “not the best vaccine” for the said group of people.
FDA said local clinical trial data showed that the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 65.3 to 91.2 percent when used on clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59, however, it has a lower efficacy rate of only 50.4 percent on healthcare workers.
The Department of Health (DOH) and the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), however, recommended the use of Sinovac for healthcare workers.
“The DOH, FDA, and our panel of experts concur that the current available evidence is enough to establish that the vaccine is safe for use,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a press briefing Friday, Feb. 26.
Roque said the country’s health workers may decline the Sinovac vaccine and wait for their preferred brand of the preventive drug. He said these health workers would not lose their priority status if they reject the first available drug.
‘Other countries using Sinovac’
Aside from the Philippines, two other Southeast Asian (SEA) countries also received their first batch of COVID-19 jabs from China’s Sinovac, namely Indonesia and Thailand.
Indonesia – the first country to give Sinovac’s CoronaVac an emergency use approval (EUA) outside China – received their jabs on Dec. 3, and kicked off their inoculation program last Jan. 13, with President Joko Widodo getting the first jab.
Thailand, meanwhile, got their Sinovac vaccines delivered on Feb. 24.
Like the Philippines, Thailand is also eyeing to roll out its Sinovac jabs by March 1.
Outside Asia, countries like Turkey, Chile, and Azerbaijan had already started inoculating its citizens with CoronaVac.
‘Safety and effectivity’
Countries that conducted clinical trials for Sinovac’s CoronaVac like Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey yielded different results in terms of the vaccine’s efficacy.
Researches in Brazil said the vaccine has 50.4 percent efficacy against “mild-to-severe” cases.
In Indonesia, experts said the vaccine had 65.3 percent efficacy, while trials in Turkey showed CoronaVac to be 91.25 percent effective.
As for possible side effects, a Sinovac official said persons who have gotten the jab usually feel muscle pain afterward.
In a press briefing on Wednesday, Feb. 24, Sinovac Hong Kong general manager Helen Yang assured the Filipino public that CoronaVac has no “fatal” side effect.
The World Health Organization said in its “Types of vaccine and adverse reactions” module said inactivated vaccine-like CoronaVac “may not always induce an immune response and the response may not be long-lived.”
“Several doses of inactivated whole-cell vaccines may be required to evoke a sufficient immune response,” it added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The United States on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson’s COVID vaccine for emergency use, giving the nation a third shot to battle the outbreak that has killed more than 500,000 Americans.

The single-shot vaccine is highly effective in preventing severe COVID-19, including against newer variants, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said before giving it a green light.
“This is exciting news for all Americans, and an encouraging development in our efforts to bring an end to the crisis,” US President Joe Biden said in a statement.But he urged Americans to remain vigilant with anti-virus curbs such as social distancing, warning that new variants of the virus still posed a threat.
“But we cannot let our guard down now or assume that victory is inevitable,” he said.A third vaccine is seen as a vital means to ramp up the immunization rate in the United States, where more than 500,000 people have lost their lives to the coronavirus.In large clinical trials, the J&J vaccine’s efficacy against severe disease was 85.9 percent in the United States, 81.7 percent in South Africa, and 87.6 percent in Brazil.Overall, among 39,321 participants across all regions, the efficacy against severe COVID-19 was 85.4 percent, but it fell to 66.1 percent when including moderate forms of the disease.
Crucially, analyses of various demographic groups revealed no marked differences across age, race, or people with underlying conditions.
– 100 million doses by June –
The J&J vaccine is the third to be greenlighted in the United States after Pfizer’s and Moderna’s were provisionally approved in December.Over 65 million people in America have so far received at least one shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines — but unlike those, the J&J vaccine requires just one dose, and is stored at fridge temperatures, offering logistical and practical advantages.
The J&J shot appears less protective than Pfizer and Moderna’s two-shot regimens, which both have an efficacy of around 95 percent against all forms of COVID-19 from the classic coronavirus strain.
All three have been shown to fully protect against hospitalizations and death, however.
Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Washington Post the two earlier vaccines were tested months before the emergence of “variants of concern” that could affect the efficacy, meaning the Pfizer and Moderna results were not an “apples to apples” comparison with the J&J shot.There was a hint, based on preliminary data, that the J&J vaccine might be effective against asymptomatic infection — though the company said it needs to do more research.The company has announced it aims to deliver 20 million doses by the end of March, with 100 million by June — though the US is pushing to expedite that timeline.
The J&J vaccine uses a common-cold causing adenovirus, which has been genetically modified so that it can’t replicate, to carry the gene for a key protein of the coronavirus into human cells.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

BETTER DAYS
Senator Sonny Angara
According to February 24 Bloomberg data, some 213 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have already been administered in 95 countries. And with an average inoculation rate of 6.1 million a day, it was estimated that it will take 5.1 years before global herd immunity — where at least 75 percent of the world’s population is vaccinated — will be achieved.
Attaining this herd immunity to finally end the pandemic entails surmounting the greatest logistical challenge humanity has ever faced in modern history. It also involves navigating some of the deepest inequalities between and within nations.At a recent virtual meeting of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres decried that current COVID-19 vaccination trends to be “wildly uneven and unfair.” He pointed out that while only 10 countries account for as much as three-fourths of all the vaccines that have already been administered, more than a hundred other countries, like the Philippines, have yet to receive a single dose.
In late January this year, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) reported that of the 12.5 billion doses that the main vaccine producers have pledged for 2021, 6.4 billion were pre-ordered mostly by high-income countries. Having purchased such high volumes, richer countries like Canada and the United Kingdom could reportedly inoculate their entire populations many times over.
One article in the South China Morning Post put it succinctly: “If the big problem of 2020 was the coronavirus, the big one of 2021 is shaping up to be vaccine inequality.” Leaving this issue unaddressed will surely prolong the pandemic and the economic recovery. In fact, a study commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce Research Foundation even estimated that vaccine inequality could cost the global economy up to US$9.2 trillion.
Of course, this is where the COVAX facility of the World Health Organization (WHO) comes in, as it aims to provide every country — especially the ones with limited resources — with doses to inoculate at least 20 percent of their populations.By and large however, low-income countries will still need to fight tooth and nail to purchase the doses they need, or attract donations from other countries.Having fallen behind, they will still be hard-pressed to scrounge up the resources, hasten the procurement process, and ensure the unhampered delivery and distribution of vaccines.
The National COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act — which we recently sponsored, and which both Houses of Congress passed upon certification by the President — aims to provide some solutions to this problem.
For one, it provides legal cover for our Local Government Units (LGUs) and private entities to procure and even make advance payments for vaccines and ancillary supplies and services, subject to certain conditions.By enabling LGUs and private entities this way, wefree up even more resources to purchase vaccines.While there is roughly ₱82.5 billion that has been appropriated in 2021 for our national COVID-19 immunization program, we are adding more to this fund by allowing LGUs and companies to use whatever resources they have to purchase vaccines and the related supplies.
In fact, based on a survey and study conducted by the League of Provinces of the Philippines (LPP), 70 LGUs are prepared to spend a little more than ₱13 billion to purchase and administer vaccines — ₱4.392 billion from 32 provinces and ₱8.72 billion from 38 cities and municipalities.Then as of December last year, hundreds of Filipino companies pooled their resources and were able to secure pledges of up to 17 million doses. With revenues down, we will need as much cash as we can to procure and administer vaccines expeditiously.
The measure also responds to the issue of indemnification that some vaccine manufacturers have required for their supply agreements.Under the measure, a COVID-19 national indemnity fund — worth ₱500 million to be administered by PhilHealth — will be established for the compensation of any inoculated person who subsequently experiences severe adverse effects or even death. We believe that by putting such terms in black and white, we remove a significant barrier to the signing of a vaccine supply agreement.
We’ve also exempted purchases, importations, and donations of COVID-19 vaccines from customs duties, VAT, excise tax, donor’s tax, and other fees and charges. In doing so, we hope to encourage more parties to donate vaccines for the benefit of the public.
With the assistance of our Senate colleagues, counterparts in the House, and friends in the academe and the private sector, we were able to pass such an important measure in a short amount of time. We are also thankful that President Duterte has swiftly signed it into law.Sen. Sonny Angara has been in public service for 16 years.He has authored and sponsored more than 200 laws.

Senator Joel Villanueva said there should be no more excuse for delaying the purchase of coronavirus vaccines now that President Duterte has signed the “COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act”.
Sen. Joel Villanueva (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
In a statement on Saturday, February 27, Villanueva expressed confidence that the law will help address the lack of vaccines “and erase the shame of our being last in the ASEAN to get one.”Since the measure increases the number of buyers, removes taxes, relaxes procurement rules, and creates an indemnity fund, “then it will make it easier for government to close vaccine supply deals,” he said.“It will make us competitive in the global vaccine race,” Villanueva added.
Duterte on Friday night signed the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act, which aims to expedite the procurement of vaccines through the local government units and private sector. The law, among several others, also includes at least P500 million indemnification fund being requested by some vaccine makers before supplying the country with their products.
Villanueva urged the executive department to use the law to shore up the country’s vaccine inventory as he raised concern the government’s planned purchases might not be enough to vaccinate the country’s population.
“Kung meron pong (If there will be) five million vaccine doses before end of March and another 24 million doses then that would only cover 12 percent of the 110 million population at two doses per person. Kaya kulang pa po (That’s why it’s not enough),” he said.“Kung totoo pong meron na (If it’s true that there will be) 161 million doses by the end of the year, well and good. If this bill is what is needed to firm up its delivery, then invoke its provisions,” he added.
Villanueva said Congress has “done [its] part” in providing the necessary funds and policies to speed up the government’s procurement of the vaccines.
“It is time for them to deliver.May pondo at polisiya na (There is already a fund and a policy). Insurance sa babakunahan at indemnity fund na hiningi ng mga suppliers, isinama na po namin (We included it). Naglagay na rin po tayo ng (We also put a) vaccination list plus vaccination card.We also removed the taxes and the procurement restrictions,” he said.
“If they’ve asked ask to throw in the kitchen sink, we would have done it so there will be no more excuses for the delay. May batas na po, bakuna na lang kulang (We now have a law, all we need are the vaccines),” Villanueva stressed. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

All a Canadian woman wants for her 94th birthday is a COVID-19 vaccine, according to a handwritten sign outside her home in Toronto.
Shipments of initial doses of the newly authorized Moderna Covid-19 vaccine arriving at selected ports of entry in Canada on December 24, 2020
“I am 94 today! No gifts, just the vaccine please,” it reads.
Nina Rockett’s daughter Margot made and hung the banner at her mother’s house in Canada’s largest metropolis when she turned one year older on February 24, amid mounting frustrations with the relatively slow pace of Canada’s vaccine rollout.Canada has ordered or reserved more than 400 million doses of vaccine from seven suppliers, and started inoculating its citizens in December 2020 with the first authorized candidates made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. A third one developed by AstraZeneca was approved on Friday.
But the nation, with no vaccine production capacity of its own, hit a bump in the past month with shortages and delivery delays linked to European manufacturing issues.
So far less than three percent of Canada’s population of 38 million has received at least one shot.
“It was the night before my mother’s birthday and I realized she is turning 94 and she has no vaccine,” Margot said in an interview with AFP.She lamented “a lot of broken promises” and a lack of firm information from doctors, public health officials and governments. Each of Canada’s 10 provinces is responsible for administering vaccines purchased in bulk and distributed by the federal government.
“What is happening here is terrible, is shameful,” she said.
“I was fed up and I thought I just want the world to know that she is 94 and she is worthy of having the vaccine — and she wants it.”As she spoke, the sounds of a passing car honking its horn broke the uneasy quiet of the neighborhood in a city that has been in a pandemic lockdown since December 26.
It’s been two days of “horns honking, thumbs up, (passersby) yelling I support you” and sharing stories of being unable to see their isolated elderly parents or grandparents for fear of unwittingly passing on the novel coronavirus to them, Margot Rockett said.
“I think everybody should hang a banner like this outside their door or window or balcony” to raise awareness of the plight of the elderly in Canada over the past year, she commented.
As of Friday, Canada has reported more than 858,000 cases of the coronavirus and 21,865 fatalities.The bulk of them have been in Ontario and Quebec provinces where more than nine out of 10 COVID-19 deaths were people aged 60 years or older SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Canada on Friday authorized a third COVID-19 vaccine, adding AstraZeneca’s candidate to its approved list alongside the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots.
Ottawa has ordered 20 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, officials said, and two million shots of the same formula made by the Serum Institute of India.
“In other words, we now have a third safe and effective vaccine independently approved by health experts in Canada,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference.“This is very encouraging news. It means more people vaccinated, and sooner.”
Officials said evaluations of Johnson & Johnson’s and Novovax’s respective COVID-19 vaccines have been completed and decisions on their approvals are expected soon.
The World Health Organization has announced that the AstraZeneca vaccine could be given to people aged 65 and over despite concerns about its efficacy, and used in countries where variants of the novel coronavirus have been found.Canada said it will make it available to its citizens aged over 18.It has been found to be about 62 percent effective in preventing infection, compared to more than 90 percent for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that are based on different technology.
Already in use in Britain and the European Union, it requires two doses four to 12 weeks apart to offer the best protection, but does not need to be stored in extreme cold temperatures in contrast to the Pfizer vaccine, making its distribution simpler and with a broader reach.
Canada started its vaccine rollout in December 2020 but recently faced shortages due to European manufacturing issues, with no production capacity of its own.“Canada is hungry for vaccines,” Health Canada senior advisor Supriya Sharma told a separate media briefing. “We’re putting more on the buffet table.”
The department, she added, has concluded “that the benefits outweigh the risks.”
As of Friday, Canada has reported more than 858,000 cases of the coronavirus and 21,865 fatalities.
Ottawa has ordered or reserved more than 400 million doses of vaccine from seven suppliers for a population of 38 million.
The first shipment from the Serum Institute of India is scheduled to arrive within weeks, with the remainder to be delivered over the next couple of months.By the end of March, Trudeau said, Ottawa expects to receive a total of 6.5 million Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccine doses, and tens of millions more in April and June — getting back on track to a stated target of inoculating all Canadians by September.

The US will begin in mid-March a clinical trial of a version of Moderna’s COVID vaccine specific to the South Africa variant, Anthony Fauci, the top advisor to the White House on the pandemic, said Friday.The Phase 1 trial will involve 210 people to study both the immune response generated by the vaccine and its safety, he said.
Unlike previous trials there will be no placebo, and instead the experiment will look at various combinations of the new vaccine and the old, both in people who were previously vaccinated and in people who have never before been vaccinated.
The goal is to determine how well the different strategies compare in their ability to neutralize the B.1.351 strain, which has been shown to partly reduce the effectiveness of the current generation of vaccines.
Carrying out the early-stage trial “does not necessarily mean a commitment to make 300 million, or 600, million doses of this vaccine,” said Fauci.“This is all going to depend on the dynamics of the outbreak and what other variants might be dominant.”
The Food and Drug Administration said earlier this week that variant-specific COVID vaccines would likely not need to go through the same level of clinical testing that the first versions did before they receive authorization. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A US panel of independent experts voted unanimously Friday in favor of recommending Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose COVID-19 shot for emergency approval, clearing the way for a third vaccine to soon begin shipping in the world’s hardest hit country.
The committee’s 22 members were convened by the Food and Drug Administration and included leading scientists as well as consumer and industry representatives.
Although their recommendations aren’t binding, they are usually followed.An emergency use authorization (EUA) will likely follow, probably in the coming days, making the J&J vaccine the third to be greenlighted in the United States after Pfizer’s and Moderna’s were provisionally approved in December.
“We’ve all seen the news about (the) Johnson and Johnson vaccine today — (the) third, safe effective vaccine,” President Joe Biden said from Houston shortly after the vote.
“We’re going to use every conceivable way to expand manufacturing of the vaccine… and make even more rapid progress in getting (shots) to people’s arms.”
Administration officials said this week they hoped to deliver three to four million doses next week.The recommendation followed a day-long, live-streamed virtual meeting to decide if the known benefits of the drug outweigh its known risks for use in people aged 18 and over — which gave the public an inside look at the details of the scientific debate.
“Janssen’s vaccine candidate will play a critical role in the global efforts to fight COVID-19,” Johan Van Hoof, global head of vaccines research and development at J&J’s Janssen subsidiary, had told the meeting, emphasizing the shot’s high efficacy against severe COVID-19, including against new variants.
He also stressed the fact that it was proven to work with a single shot, and could be stored long term at fridge temperatures, which “offers logistical and practical advantages.”– Placebo crossover –In a global trial of almost 40,000 people, the vaccine’s efficacy against severe disease was 85.4 percent, but it fell to 66.1 percent when including moderate forms of the disease.
This makes it slightly less protective than Pfizer and Moderna’s two-shot regimens, which both have an efficacy of around 95 percent against symptomatic COVID-19.
Nevertheless, experts say J&J’s shot will bring to bear a powerful new weapon against the outbreak in the United States, where more than 500,000 people have died.
Van Hoof said that if authorized, J&J would apply to amend their trials so that people who received the placebo could now receive the vaccine.The idea is to compare relative efficacy between people who were vaccinated earlier against later, to see if immunity wanes over time.The company is also planning to soon begin testing its vaccine on children.
It is separately studying whether two doses might be more protective than one — which raised concerns among some panelists who felt people who got one dose might feel short-changed if two doses ends up proving more effective.
– Anaphylaxis case –
During J&J’s presentation, company scientist Macaya Douoguih revealed that a case of anaphylaxis occurred in a health worker in South Africa — the first time this has happened for the shot.Some rare anaphylaxis cases have been reported for the Pfizer and Moderna shots.In almost 44,000 people studied for safety issues, the vaccine was well tolerated, with typical side-effects like injection-site pain, headache, fatigue and muscle pains.
There were a handful of cases of people who developed hives, which could have been linked to the shot.The FDA also said long-term monitoring was needed to determine whether the vaccine was linked to a small number of cases of potentially dangerous clotting, and to tinnitus (ear ringing).
Seven people died from COVID-19 in the placebo group, and none in the vaccine group.
There was a hint, based on preliminary data, that the vaccine might be partly effective against asymptomatic infection.
The company has announced it aims to deliver a total of 20 million doses to the United States by the end of March, with 100 million by June — though the US is pushing to expedite that timeline.
The J&J vaccine uses a common-cold causing adenovirus, which has been genetically modified so that it can’t replicate, to carry the gene for a key protein of the coronavirus into human cells.Those cells then produce that protein, which in turn trains the human immune system should it encounter the real virus.

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) refuted allegations that it is skipping the priority list in order to get first dibs on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines that will soon arrive in the country.
“Hindi po kami nakikipag-agawan, hindi po kami nakikipag-unahan sa pagbabakunang ito. Kung ano ang mailaan sa amin, tatanggapin namin sapagkat mahalaga sa amin na protektado ang aming mga kasamahan (We are not trying to cut the line in this vaccination program. Whatever is given to us, we will accept it because we want to protect our personnel),” said Major Gen. Edgard Arevalo, AFP spokesperson, at a “Laging Handa” press briefing Friday, Feb.26.Arevalo gave these remarks even as the public awaits the arrival of the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines from aboard this Sunday, Feb. 28.He said the AFP personnel are likely to be inoculated with the vaccine made by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac.
“The vaccination of our soldiers will start as soon as the vaccines are aready available,” he said.
After the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Sinovac with an emergency use authorization last Monday, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana bared that around 100,000 doses of the vaccines were donated by China to the Department of National Defense through Chinese Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe.
Of the donated vaccines, Arevalo said 50,000 doses will be administered to the soldiers while the remaining doses will go to other priorities of the government.Aside from this, Arevalo said the AFP is also awaiting confirmation if it be given a portion of the 500,000 vaccine donations earlier promised by the Chinese government. The commitment was made by Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi through Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. back in January.
Meanwhile, the FDA had also reportedly approved the “compassionate use” of 10,000 doses of Chinese vaccine Sinopharm among the Presidential Security Group (PSG) personnel.
He again defended the PSG from the secret vaccination of some of its personnel using an unregistered COVID-19 vaccine last year, saying the soldiers “sacrificed their own health and safety to protect President Duterte from all forms of threat.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is raring to do its part to ensure the successful nationwide rollout of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination program, a military spokesperson said Friday, Feb. 26.
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) (MANILA BULLETIN)
“We, at the Armed Forces of the Philippines, are ready. Our Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, is focused on ensuring that the military is ready to fulfill its supporting roles once the rollout begins,” said Major Gen. Edgard Arevalo at a Laging Handa press briefing.
The first batch of the COVID-19 vaccines is set to arrive from abroad on Sunday, Feb. 28.The AFP will play three supporting roles in the government’s national vaccination program to eliminate the threat of COVID-19, according to Arevalo.
These roles include ensuring the overall peace and security situation during the vaccination program, the lending of military medical personnel in areas where additional manpower is needed, and logistical support in transporting the vaccines from the cold storage facilities to the designated vaccine sites.
Arevalo also noted that Sobejana gave an order to vaccinate all of the 120,000-strong military personnel so they can fulfill their duties to help the government in the vaccination program.
“We do not want our personnel to be the carriers of the virus and bring the disease to our countrymen whom we want to serve,” he said.To inoculate all of its personnel, the AFP created 72 vaccination teams and identified 47 vaccination sites within military camps that have treatment facilities. Twenty-seven vaccination sites have already acquired an authorization from the Department of Health (DOH) while 20 more are awaiting the go signal.
Of these, a total of 12 are located in Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), Region 1, Region 2, and Region 3, and are managed by the Northern Luzon Command (NoLCom); eight in Metro Manila, supervised by the Joint Task Force National Capital Region (JTF-NCR); 10 in Region 4A and Region 5, under the command of Southern Luzon Command (SoLCom); two in Region 4B, under the Western Command (WesCom), and six in Region 6, Region 7, and Region 8, under the Central Command (CentCom).
There are also a total of five vaccination sites in Region 9 and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), under the command of the Western Mindanao Command (WesMinCom); and four sites in Region 10 and Region 11, under the Eastern Mindanao Command (EastMinCom).We aim to inoculate 100 personnel per day,” Arevalo said.
Meanwhile, military camps which have no treatment facilities are directed to coordinate with the local government units and DOH offices for the establishment of a vaccination site.
It is likely that the Coronavac vaccine made by Chinese firm Sinovac will be used in inoculating the military personnel, Arevalo said.
He said the vaccination will be free of charge for all military personnel. However, he reiterated that soldiers will have to pay if they opt for another brand of vaccine.
“If they choose another brand, they have to pay for it since it was not the original brand that was given to us,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) has agreed to recommend the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine for medical frontliners.

Based on the clinical trial data of the Sinovac vaccine, it was shown that the vaccine is “50 percent effective in preventing mild symptoms, and 100 percent effective against moderate to severe symptoms,” said Vergeire, adding that the data also shows that it is effective in “reducing morbidity and mortality.”
“Given this evidence, the NITAG has deemed it sufficient to recommend the use of the vaccine for healthcare workers as it bears to reiterate that our goal for prioritizing healthcare workers for vaccination is to reduce morbidity and mortality among their group while we maintain the most critical essential health services,” said the DOH spokesperson.Right to refuseHealthcare workers have the right to refuse the Sinovac vaccineand wait for the arrival of other vaccine brands, said the health experts.
“We like to emphasize again that vaccination with the incoming Sinovac donation is voluntary and we’d like to give the right of refusal after informed choice to our healthcare workers because they deserve it,” said Dr. Nina Carandang, health social scientist and professor of the College of Medicine at the University of the Philippines-Manila.
“If they want to give their slot for this particular Sinovac vaccine and wait for the next vaccine to arrive in the country, that is their personal decision and it is not mandatory for them to accept this particular Sinovac vaccine,” she added.It is only right that the healthcare workers be given the choice, said Dr. Edsel Salvana, a member of the DOH Technical Advisory Group.“I think it is completely appropriate that we be given the first choice whether we are going to take this vaccine that’s already available or if we want to wait. But at the same time, based on the data, this vaccine looks like it will save lives and so I think, it is right that we offer it to the people who have been on the frontlines, who have been saving lives,” he said.
“If they feel that it is not the right vaccine for them, then we are not going to penalize them, they are still first in line either for Pfizer or Astra[Zeneca]. But as for myself,a healthcare worker who sees covid patients, I’m willing to take this vaccine,” he added.
Carandang encouraged healthcare workers to get vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine.
“We like to offer this opportunity for healthcare workers if they are willing to do so to have themselves vaccinated with Sinovac. If they don’t feel that this is not the best vaccine for them, given their risk benefit analysis for themselves, then they can still wait for the other brands of vaccines – but unfortunately we don’t know yet: what is the current status of the negotiations and what is the actual delivery date of the (other) vaccines. So that is the tricky part that you have to look at,” she said.“You may not like the current brand available, but if you think that your risk is high at this point in time because of patient care duties and exposure in the community, then you also have to think about how much worth it is for you to actually have the Sinovac vaccine because we don’t know yet as to when the next vaccines of whatever brand are coming into the country,” she added.
Carandang, meanwhile, expressed hope that the country can secure other vaccine brands soon.
“We hope that we will be able to procure our own set of other vaccines from the other brands soon,” she said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The country’s health care workers can refuse the first available coronavirus vaccine without losing their priority status in the vaccination line, Malacañang said Thursday.

Ahead of the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines in the country, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque clarified that the medical frontliners would not be forced to take a certain vaccine if they prefer to wait for another brand.The country’s Food and Drug Administration recently approved Sinovac Biotech’s coronavirus vaccines for emergency use, paving the way for the delivery of the 600,000 doses this Sunday.The vaccines have not been recommended for health workers due to varied efficacy levels but can be used for heathy people age 18 to 59.
“Puwede naman nating ibigay iyan sa mga medical frontliners na talaga namang first priority natin. Wala pong pilitan (It can be given to medical frontliners who are really our first priority but it won’t be compulsory),” Roque said during a televised press briefing Thursday, Feb. 25, about the Sinovac vaccines.
“‘Yung gustong mag-antay nga po ng ibang brand siguro ang concession na maibibigay sa kanila is puwede silang humindi at puwede silang mag-antay without losing their priority kasi iyan naman po ang nakasulat sa EUA (To those who want to wait for other brands, maybe the concession we can give them is they can decline and wait without losing their priority because that’s stated in the EUA),” he added.
Roque maintained that the “order of priority” of vaccine recipients will still be followed.“Lahat ng health professionals will still enjoy the sectoral priority dahil uubusin po muna natin ang lahat ng medical professionals, medical frontliners before we go to the geographical priorities (All health professionals still enjoy the sectorial priority because we will vaccine all medical professionals, medical frontliners before we go to the geographical priorities),” he said.
With vaccine orders reaching more then 160 million doses, the government aims to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos this year.
Early this month, the government pandemic task force released the list of priority groups in the free vaccination program.First on the list are frontline workers in health facilities including health professionals and non-professionals like students, nursing aides, janitors, and barangay health workers.
Seniors citizens and persons with comorbidities will be next on the vaccination line, followed by frontline personnel in essential sectors including uniformed personnel as well as the indigent population.
Other priority groups are teachers, social workers and other government workers; other essential workers; socio-demographic groups at higher risk other than senior citizens and indigenous people; overseas Filipino workers; remaining workforce; and the rest of the population.

The President has put his foot down when declared there should no longer be questions about the Presidential Security Group’s (PSG) vaccination, according to his spokesman Harry Roque.
“As far as the PSG is concerned, the President has been clear, there should be no questions anymore about the PSG because the PSG acted out of self-defense and out of necessity,” Roque said during a televised press briefing Thursday.
Roque made the statement when asked if the Palace will urge the PSG to cooperate with the inquiry initiated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the use of unregistered vaccines last year.
FDA director-general Rolando Enrique Domingo recently claimed that the PSG has yet to answer their queries about the matter and expressed hope it will cooperate with their probe.
Last December, PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III confirmed that several PSG close-in security members received the COVID vaccines to advance their mission to protect the President.The vaccines, supposedly donated, were administered to the PSG troopers despite the lack of regulatory approval from authorities.
Prior to the PSG admission, the President revealed that some soldiers have been inoculated with coronavirus vaccines.
By January, the President defended the PSG vaccination as a matter of “self-preservation.”
He also appealed toCongress “not to tinker” with the PSG and force its personnel to testify against their will.Recently, the FDA has granted the PSG’s request for the “compassionate use” permit of Sinopharm vaccines.
The permit allows the President’s security group to secure 10,000 doses of vaccines.
So far, Roque said the PSG has yet to receive its vaccine order from Sinopharm. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Department of Finance (DOF) approved the inclusion of all importations of coronavirus vaccines in the “Mabuhay” or express lane to allow their quick processing of the tax and duty exemptions.
In a statement released by the DOF, the department said that Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III approved the inclusion of COVID-19 vaccines in the Mabuhay lane as well as the waiving of their filing fees.
Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III
Dominguez, upon the recommendation of Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko, also allowed COVID-19 vaccine importers to use the Tax Exemption System (TES) Online Filing Module in processing their shipments.According to Dominguez, these regulatory relief measures aim ”to further support the government’s rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program.”“COVID-19 vaccine tax exemption applications in the Mabuhay Lane, which is under the DOF’s Revenue Office, will be processed within 24 working hours,” the department said.
These tax exemption policies will be incorporated in the inter-agency guidelines on the implementation of a One-Stop Shop for International Donations and Government Procured COVID-19 Vaccines.
The inter-agency guidelines are being prepared by the DOF, Department of Health, Department of Foreign Affairs, Bureau of Customs, and the Food and Drug Administration.
Tionko, who heads the DOF’s Revenue Operations Group, recommended the inclusion in the Mabuhay Lane of COVID-19 vaccine imports, “regardless of the applicable legal basis,” to “allow for the expedited processing of the tax and exemption of such applications.”Under DOF Department Order No. 54-2000, the Secretary of Finance is authorized to include additional sectors that may avail of the express service under the Mabuhay Lane.“We add that the Mabuhay Lane currently processes all Relief Consignment under Section 120 in relation to 121 of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA). The Lane is expected to process all COVID-19 vaccines which may qualify as relief consignment,” Tionko said.Relief Consignment refers to goods donated to national government agencies and accredited private entities for free distribution to, or for the use of, victims of calamities.Under Section 121 of the CMTA, relief consignment imported during a state of calamity and intended for the use of calamity victims shall be exempted from the payment of duties and taxes.Created on May 13, 1994 through DO 29-94, the Mabuhay Lane is tasked to expeditiously process applications for the tax and duty exemption of certain groups of importers, which include export-oriented firms, returning residents and non-profit, non-stock educational institutions.

If the Johnson & Johnson vaccine gets FDA approval, it would be the third vaccine to be available in the United States, after the other two made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
Unlike the two-shot dosing for the vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine only requires one shot. Meanwhile, it does not require ultra-cold storage.The FDA released an analysis on Wednesday saying the Johnson & Johnson vaccine provides strong protection against severe disease and death from COVID-19, and may reduce the spread of the virus by vaccinated people.

The 200,000 doses, the first shipment among 2 million doses Thailand ordered from the Chinese biopharmaceutical firm, were delivered by a Thai Airways International cargo flight from Beijing to Bangkok.
Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, as well as Chinese Embassy official Yang Xin were at the airport for the handover of the vaccines.“Today is a historic day with the reception of the first lot of vaccine,” Prayut said at the vaccine handover ceremony, expressing his gratitude for China’s timely delivering of the vaccines.
“Without any unexpected problems, subsequent lots will arrive as planned,” he said.
Calling it another major progress in bilateral anti-pandemic cooperation, Yang Xin said he hoped the Sinovac vaccines would play an active role in supporting Thailand’s fight against COVID-19.
Thailand approved the Sinovac vaccine for emergency use on Monday, and the authorization will be valid for one year, according to Anutin.Upon the vaccines’ arrival, three days would be required for the final inspection before the national vaccination campaign begins, Prayut said.
The first batch of the Sinovac vaccines will be distributed to 13 provinces, including Bangkok, and administered to at-risk groups, including medical workers, close contacts with COVID-19 patients and people with certain chronic illnesses.
A second batch of 800,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccines is scheduled to arrive in Thailand next month, followed by a third batch of the remaining 1 million doses.Thailand has set a three-staged national inoculation program, aiming to vaccinate enough of the general population to create herd immunity. Besides the Sinovac vaccines, it would also use AstraZeneca vaccines.

Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go on Thursday assured the public that the government is fast tracking the process of acquiring vaccines against COVID-19.(AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN)
The chairman of the Senate health and demography committee gave the assurance during his visit to Parola, Tondo, Manila where he personally led the distribution of assistance to 361 victims of a fire incident in the area.
He said President Rodrigo Duterte is constantly urging concerned officials to do everything necessary to expedite the vaccine rollout.“Alam n’yo, halos araw-araw po naming pinag-uusapan ni Pangulong Duterte. Halos araw-araw rin naming kinukulit ang ating mga opisyales, Vaccine Czar natin (si Sec. Galvez), Sec.

“Mismo si UN (United Nations) Secretary-General si (António) Guterres po mismo ang nagsabi na hindi po equal dahil, unfortunately, medyo mahirap po ang ating bayan, hindi po tayo nakasama doon sa malalaking mga bansa na nabibigyan na po ng mga bakuna.

The failure to secure the vaccines for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) until now has forced the Philippine government to offer to buy the doses for a higher price just to ensure early delivery, a top official said.
Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 (NTF AGAINST COVID-19 / MANILA BULLETIN)
Retired military chief of staff Carlito Galvez, vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19), said they are now negotiating with vaccine manufacturers for the delivery of the first batch of the vaccines by next month or the second quarter of this year.
“This is the technique that we are doing, we are offsetting their price. We are negotiating to pay a little to ensure the early delivery,” Galvez told President Duterte in Filipino during a briefing.The negotiations for the procurement of vaccine for the Philippines was early but Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin later disclosed that ‘somebody dropped the ball’ which resulted in the failure to secure the vaccine. Health Secretary Francisco Duque, however, denied that he ‘dropped the ball’.
Galvez then took the lead in securing the vaccine and the optimism went to the point that government officials declared that the vaccination roll-out would be on February 15. Dry-runs were conducted involving various government agencies that include transportation of the vaccines and even the vaccination proper.
But still, no vaccines arrived amid the vaccination roll-out of some countries that include Myanmar, Bangladesh and even conflict-torn Afghanistan.
It was later found out that the negotiations were bungled anew over failure to produce an indemnification agreement which manufacturers have been reportedly asking even from other countries.Vaccination roll-out for the Philippines is expected to begin once China’s donation for 600,000 doses of the controversial Sinovac arrives. Galvez said the China donation is set to arrive next month.
Galvez explained that delay and the low supply of doses for the first two quarters of this year was caused by the high global demand for COVID-19 vaccines.
But he said some 24 million doses of vaccines are expected to arrive in the country by second quarter, including the ones ordered by the Philippine government from Pfizer and Astrazenica.“The main volume of the procurement will arrive in the third and fourth quarter (2021) so the major vaccination roll-out really will be coming from the third and fourth quarter,” said Galvez.

The single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine is highly effective in preventing severe COVID-19, including newer variants, according to documents released by the US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday.
Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine requires only one shot and can be stored at regular fridge temperatures, giving it an operational advantage over the Pfizer and Moderna jabs
The news came as the regulator was set to convene an independent panel Friday that will likely vote to authorize the vaccine, making it the third available in the country hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
In large clinical trials, the J&J vaccine’s efficacy against severe disease was 85.9 percent in the United States, 81.7 percent in South Africa, and 87.6 percent in Brazil.Overall, among 39,321 participants across all regions, the efficacy against severe COVID-19 was 85.4 percent, but it fell to 66.1 percent when including moderate forms of the disease.
Crucially, analyses of different demographic groups revealed no marked differences across age, race, or people with underlying conditions.
The vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with no reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), which have been seen in rare cases for the Pfizer and Moderna shots.Mild to moderate reactions, like injection-site pain, headache, fatigue and muscle pains were more likely to occur in younger participants than older.There were no reported deaths in the vaccine group, but five in the placebo group.
“The analysis supported a favorable safety profile with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA (emergency use authorization),” the FDA wrote.
White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters that if authorized, the federal government would seek to distribute three to four million doses next week.
“Johnson and Johnson has announced it aims to deliver a total of 20 million doses by the end of March,” he continued, adding the government was trying to speed up the delivery of the contracted 100 million doses, which the company has promised by the end of June.
– One dose, fridge storage –
A third vaccine is seen as a vital means to ramp up the immunization rate in the United States, where more than 500,000 people have lost their lives to the coronavirus.Some 65 million people in America have so far received at least one shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines — but unlike those, the J&J vaccine requires just one dose, and is stored at fridge temperatures.
The trade-off is slightly less protection against mild or moderate forms of COVID-19.
“The vaccine was effective in preventing COVID-19 using a less restrictive definition of the disease and for more severe disease, including COVID-19 requiring medical intervention, considering all cases starting 14 days after vaccination,” the FDA wrote in its briefing document.“Although a lower efficacy overall was observed in South Africa, where there was a predominance of B.1.3.5 lineage during the time period of this study, vaccine efficacy against severe/critical COVID-19 was similarly high across the United States, South Africa, and Brazil,” it added.
There was a hint, based on preliminary data, that the vaccine might be effective against asymptomatic infection.
But “this finding needs to be further investigated with additional data,” wrote the company in a separate document made available by the FDA.
The J&J vaccine uses a common-cold causing adenovirus, which has been modified so that it can’t replicate, to carry the DNA for a key protein of the coronavirus into human cells.This makes those cells produce that protein, which in turn trains the human immune system should it encounter the real virus.
Other adenovirus vector vaccines against COVID-19 include those made by AstraZeneca-Oxford and Russia’s Sputnik V. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has proven 94 percent effective in a study involving 1.2 million people in Israel, the first peer-reviewed real world research confirming the power of mass immunization campaigns to bring the pandemic to a close.

The paper, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, also demonstrated there is likely a strong protective benefit against infection, a crucial element in breaking onward transmission.
“The fact that the vaccines worked so well in the real world… really does suggest that if the nations of the world can find the will, we now have the means to end COVID-19 forever,” said Ben Neuman, a virologist from Texas A&M University who was not involved in the research.
ADVERTISINGThe experiment was carried out between December 20 2020 and February 1, 2021 — a period when a newer variant first identified in Britain was rampant in Israel, making the vaccine’s performance all the more impressive.
Around 1.2 million people were divided into equal groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated.
Each vaccinated participant was matched to an unvaccinated “control” person of similar age, sex, geographic, medical and other characteristics.Lead author Noam Barda, head of epidemiology and research at the Clalit Research Institute, told AFP the matching process was highly robust.An elderly Ultra-Orthodox Jewish man from a particular neighborhood with a particular set of comorbidities and flu vaccination history would be matched for another person fitting that precise profile, for example.
The researchers then recorded outcomes at days 14-20 after the first of the two doses and day seven or more after the second.
The efficacy against symptomatic infections was 57 percent between 14-20 days after the first dose, but rose to 94 percent seven days after the second dose — very close to the 95 percent achieved during Phase 3 clinical trials.
People who received second doses were also highly protected against hospitalization and death — though the precise numbers here are less significant and had a wider statistical range because of the relatively lower number of cases.
The study also found people who received their second dose had a 92 percent lower chance of getting any form of infection at all compared to those who were unvaccinated.
While this finding was considered encouraging, the researchers and outside experts said it needs more confirming evidence.
That’s because the participants weren’t being systematically tested at regular intervals; rather, they were getting a test when they wanted one.The authors attempted to correct for this with statistical methods but the result is still likely imperfect.“Unless you are testing everyone all the time, this will miss some infections,” said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida.She added she was certain there was a strong protective benefit, but “nailing down this number more precisely will require specialized study designs with frequent testing.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Philippines would have to wait for coronavirus supplies and comply with health protocols after the bulk of doses have been secured by only 10 countries, President Duterte declared Wednesday.
President Rodrigo Duterte
According to the President, these few countries have dispersed 75 percent of the world’s coronavirus supply while the 130 countries have yet to receive their doses.
“There are only 10 countries today. In fact, 75 percent of all vaccination, sitenta’y singko porsyento nang lahat ng bakuna, nakuha ng 10 countries, sampu lang. Iyong 130, wala. So, maghintay tayo (The 130 countries have none yet so let’s just wait),” Duterte said during his televised address Wednesday, Feb. 24.While majority of the countries still awaited for supply, Duterte said even the United States and Canada were fighting over vaccine supply.
“Canada nga na kapitbahay ng Amerika nagdadamutan pa sila. Kino-corner talaga ng Amerika lahat ngayon kasi they have about 270 million people…332 million (Canada and United States are neighbors but are being selfish. America has really cornered all because they have about 332 million),” he added.
Pending the arrival of the vaccines, the President urged anew the public to observe health protocols, most especially wearing masks to avoid getting infected. Duterte showed his white face mask, saying it can save people “a lot of trouble and expense.”
“I’m not trying to, I said, pontificate here. Iyong in the meantime, you just better follow government at iwasan…Iyong — iyong mask, ito. Ito it can save you a lot of trouble and expense. Simple lang ito (This is simple),” he said.United Nations Secretary António Guterres recently found unfair that around 10 countries have control over the majority of the vaccine supply. The UN chief lamented that vaccine equity was the “biggest moral test” before the international community.
In the Philippines, the government expects to receive 161 million doses of coronavirus by the end of the year. The supply delivery has been hampered by indemnity and regulatory requirements as well as supply challenges.
The first batch of doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by China is expected to be delivered to the country this Sunday.In the meeting the President and other Cabinet members, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. admitted that the country has a thin COVID-19 supply line this first quarter.
Citing “indicative delivery of vaccines,” Galvez said around 3.5 million doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines through the World Health Organization’s COVAX facility. An additional 600,000 donated doses will be coming from China.
Galvez added there will be a procurement by the Department of Health of 1 million doses by March.
“Talagang manipis tayo sa first quarter. Ang total niyan is 5.1 million (We will have a thin supply this first quarter. The total will only be 5.1 million),” he told the President.
Galvez said they are negotiating for more vaccine supplies from the United Kingdom, China, Russia, India for first quarter. He said it was imperative to vaccinate around 1.7 million health care workers as well as seniors and other vulnerable citizens.“Ito ang medyo talagang malaking problema natin dahil sa global demand, napakababa ng ating supply sa first quarter (This is really our big problem because due to global demand, we have a very low supply in the first quarter),” he said.
By the second quarter, Galvez said the country could expect 24.1 million doses of coronavirus vaccines, that includes 6 million jabs from COVAX facility. The main volume of supplies is expected to arrive in the country by third and fourth quarter of the year.
With these forthcoming supplies, he said the country’s major vaccine rollout will occur in second half of the year. He said they are trying to negotiate an early delivery of the supplies from the vaccine manufacturers even at a higher cost.
“We are expecting to receive 161 million doses by the end of 2021,” he said.
Galvez also informed the President that they are “polishing” three supply agreements with drug manufacturers in terms of indemnity and delivery.
The country has so far secured 17 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines after advance payments were made by the private sector and the local government units. Galvez said he also conducted marathon negotiations with Moderna Wednesday morning to finalize the language of the supply agreement.
He said vaccine manufacturers have asked for a “full blanket” indemnity in the supply deals but the government could not agree with such request. The vaccine makers should still maintain “good manufacturing practices” to ensure the protection of vaccine recipients, he said.
He noted that the government cannot fully waive immunity especially in case of malpractice and willful neglect in the vaccination. He insisted that the government has a duty to protect public safety and health. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

There is no need to conduct a special audit of all the funds that would be spent under the implementation of the proposed law expediting the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines if the Commission on Audit will examine purchases through regular audit process.
Quirino Rep. Junie Cua
Quirino Rep. Junie Cua said auditing rules still apply under Senate Bill 2057 or the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021, which the House of Representatives adopted Tuesday night.
“Once you use government funds (to purchase), it will definitely pass the scrutiny of state auditors,” Cua said during an online press briefing, when asked if there is a need for a special audit on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.The Senate on Tuesday approved on third and final reading Senate Bill No. 2057 which allows local government units (LGUs) to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport and distribution.
“All procurement, even if that is negotiated or did not pass through bidding, will eventually be audited,” Cua pointed out.
Under the bill, LGUs are also allowed to make advance payments not more than 50 percent of the contract price.
Cua also pointed out that the law requires LGUs to procure the COVID-19 vaccines through the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force against COVID-19 (NTF).“So no special audit is needed because there is no need for that. Whoever is the resident auditor (in that LGU), they are the ones that will conduct the audit,” Cua said.
Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, chair of the Senate finance panel and sponsor of the measure, had said many LGUs are already waiting for the enactment of the bill in order to exempt them from the legal requirements regarding the procurement of goods.
Among the laws covered by the exemption under the proposed COVID-19 law are Republic Act 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, Presidential Decree 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, and the Local Government Code.“The bill will provide legal cover to the LGUs, many of which have intimated to us their concern about possible adverse findings by the Commission on Audit (COA) and even graft cases that may be filed against their officials,” Angara said on Tuesday, Feb. 23.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce on Wednesday said they have no plans to link the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccines to the deployment of Filipino health care workers in the United Kingdom.
This was in response to an earlier proposal made by Labor and Employment Secretary Silvestre Bello III offering Germany and the UK of deploying more nurses to those countries in exchange for providing the Philippines with some 600,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines.
“We’ve got no plans to link the vaccines with those conversations around the recruitment of nurses,” Pruce told reporters during a virtual press briefing.
The British diplomat admitted that the proposal to trade the vaccine for the lifting of the deployment cap for Filipinos health care workers (HCWs) abroad was raised by Bello himself during their last conversation a few weeks ago “in the midst of the number of points that we were also exchanging views on.”
While they understand the basis upon which the Philippines’ offer came given the demands of the pandemic, the British diplomat explained the hiring of Filipino HCWs is being done based on their government’s policy decision in terms of managing the flow of health care professionals.
On the vaccine distribution, Pruce said the UK has made an emphatic commitment that any vaccine excess that it may have in the course of their vaccine deployment plan will be directed through the COVAX facility.
COVAX facility is the mechanism launched by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission and France to ensure that people in all corners of the world will get access to COVID-19 vaccines once they are available, regardless of their wealth.
Early this month, it was announced that the COVAX has allotted the Philippines 10 million vaccine doses, mostly the Astra Zeneca brand, but will be delivered on an installment basis. Pruce said the COVAX vaccine allocations to countries, including the Philippines, will be done in a “fair and equitable” manner.“And it will be through COVAX facility that distribution of surplus vaccines through developing countries will be managed in a fair and equitable way,” he said.

It’s up to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) whether to include in its probe newspaper columnist and special envoy to China Ramon “Mon” T. Tulfo Jr. who admitted his inoculation of an unregistered vaccine against the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) last year, Justice Secretary Menardo I. Guevarra said on Wednesday, Feb. 24.
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)(MANILA BULLETIN)“The NBI has an ongoing investigation on the alleged importation, entry, sale, and administration of unregistered COVID-19 vaccines in the underground market,” he said.
“I will leave it to the NBI to determine if it’s necessary or relevant to invite Ramon Tulfo to shed light on the matter,” he also said.In his newspaper column, Tulfo revealed that he was vaccinated last year with Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine.Guevarra had issued a Department order that directed the NBI “to conduct an investigation on the reported importation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, administration, and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines that are not authorized by or registered with the Food and Drug Administration” (FDA).
He also directed the NBI “to file the appropriate charges against all persons involved and found responsible for any unlawful act in connection therewith.”Guevarra’s directive was following revelations made by Presidential Security Group (PSG) Commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III that the PSG was able to get COVID-19 vaccines and have its personnel vaccinated to better protect President Duterte from getting infected with the virus.
But Guevarra clarified that his order to the NBI on the probe was not prompted by reports on the vaccination conducted on PSG’s security personnel. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement after Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III proposed to Germany and the United Kingdom to the deployment of Filipino health care workers (HCWs) in those countries.Such scenario is premised on the expectation that those countries will provide the Philippines with with COVID-19 vaccines.
The proposal, however, was met with criticisms, including one from former Vice President Jejomar Binay who described the move as “insensitive and dehumanizing.”
In his Wednesday presser, Roque said that Malacañang respects the opinion of all Filipinos about the issue as much as it welcomes the move of the DOLE and the DFA.
“Lahat naman po ng opinion ng ating mga kababayan nirerespeto natin dahil meron po tayong kalayaan ng malayang pananalita sa Pilipinas (We respect every opinion of the public because all of us have the right to free speech in the Philippines),” he said.He, however, said that President Duterte had nothing to do with the move.
“The President was not informed of this proposal, as far as I know,” Roque said.
“Hindi po ito ideya ng Presidente. Ideya po ito ni Secretary Bello and Secretary Locsin na wini-welcome din natin (This is not the President’s idea. This is the idea of Secretary Bello and Secretary Locsin which we welcome) because more is better than less,” he added.According to the Palace official, it was up to the two cabinet secretaries to make the same offer to other countries.
“That’s up to both DFA and DOLE. But as far as the President is concerned, we have ordered more than enough [vaccines],” Roque said.
Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., said on Tuesday that Europe “appreciated” Bello’s offer. He even praised Bello for his initiative.
Bello has conveyed to both Germany and the UK governments that the Philippines is willing to grant exemption from the deployment cap of Filipino health care workers should they agree to the vaccine request.

This was the assertion of Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph G. Recto, Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri and opposition Senator Risa Hontiveros.
They said Malacanang could not give excuses on vaccines purchases when the bill passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives would be enacted into law.Recto said the Legislative Branch acceded to Malacanang’s requirements in buying the vaccines.The measure passed by the Senate includes an Indemnification Fund to answer for any serious adverse effects of the vaccines on those vaccinated.
Malacanang had told Congress that vaccine makers wanted these conditions before they sell the vaccines to the country. Recto said the measure passed by the Senate includes rules on vaccine purchases by the national government, local government units (LGUs), private and civic groups.
The measure also includes exemptions from all forms of taxes in the importation and roll out of these vaccines to private firms.Recto described the measure as a good one and that the Executive branch follows it.When enacted into law, Zubiri said the ball would be in Malacanang’s hands in the importation and distribution of the vaccines after Congress has done its responsibility.

A growing number of Poles are opposed to getting a COVID vaccine,according to an opinion poll published on Tuesday, despite government warnings about a rising “third wave” of infections.
The survey conducted by pollsters CBOS this month found 33 percent of Poles do not want to get vaccinated, against 55 percent who said they were in favour.
In a previous poll by CBOS in January, the proportion had been 30 percent against getting a vaccine and 56 percent in favour.Less than half the respondents aged under 45 want to be vaccinated, according to the latest poll of 1,179 people conducted from February 1-11.
Infection numbers have been rising in Poland and the government warned last week that it expects the trend to continue because of new strains, although it has so far not said it will reverse the recent easing of restrictions.
“The third wave of the pandemic is already in Poland and it is no longer a question of whether this will happen or not but what the scale will be,” Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said on Friday.
So far this year, the government has re-opened non-essential shops as well as museums, cinemas, theatres and swimming pools.The health ministry on Tuesday reported 6,310 new infections and 247 deaths — up from 5,178 infections and 196 deaths on the same day last week.

Go, chairman of the Senate health committee, emphasized that authorities are doing their best to secure sufficient supply of vaccines for the country,Furthermore, Go also urged experts, such as those in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to provide clear explanations to the public on the steps and precautions being taken to ensure that lives will be protected when the vaccine program is rolled-out.
He, likewise, appealed to the public to trust the health experts and rely on credible sources of information in order to be aware and fully understand why vaccination is crucial in overcoming the pandemic towards full recovery.Go also sought an explanation from the FDA on its decision not to recommend the use of China’s Sinovac vaccine against COVID-19 on medical frontliners.He said that FDA Director General Eric Domingo should explain to the public why they have to set such conditions and why they choose the type of vaccines that would be used by the health workers. Go’s statement came after Domingo disclosed that they have already approved the emergency use of Sinovac vaccines in the Philippines but would not recommend the use of this brand to medical frontliners due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4 percent based on clinical trials worldwide.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said that a total of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines would be donated to the Philippines by the Chinese government. The Philippines also plans to buy more doses from Sinovac on top of what will be donated.While awaiting the vaccine rollout, Go reminded the public to remain vigilant, cooperate with authorities, and trust that the government is doing everything it could to overcome the ongoing crisis.Go appealed for understanding from the public for the difficulties encountered in securing the vaccines.

Task Force head Dr Maricar Ang said this is because posting it on social media may result in many people fearing the vaccine.
“It may result in many people fearing the vaccine if they post on social media the adverse effects without any proof that it was caused by the vaccine given to them,” she said during the Laging Handa press briefing Tuesday, Feb. 23.“There is a proper forum for reporting. There is a group in charge of getting adverse effects following immunization,” added Ang.
She said individuals should report it to the proper agency in order to find out if it was really caused by the vaccine they received.
“We need to analyze if the adverse effects, like allergies, are really due to the vaccine or not,” said Ang.
Meanwhile, Dr. Lulu Bravo of the Philippine Medical Association for Immunization said the public should trust the experts when it comes to the vaccines.“As I have always mentioned we have to trust experts. They were the ones looking at all the data,” she said in a television interview.
“It’s easy to make a judgment but it’s not easy to pour and look over at scientific data to really come out and say ‘okay, this is best for us now,'” added Bravo.
On Monday, the Food and Drug Authority (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authority (EUA) for the COVID-19 vaccine of China’s Sinovac Biotech.FDA Director General Undersecretary Eric Domingo said all conditions for an EUA are present and the benefits of using the vaccine outweigh the known and potential risks.
He said interim data show that when the vaccine is used on clinically healthy members of a community aged 18 to 59 it has an efficacy rate of 65.3 to 91.2 percent.
However, he said, it has a lower efficacy rate of 50.4 percent when used on healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19.
“Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this group,” said Domingo. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“Europe appreciated the offer. Thank you Bebot. You da man. Will save us. He also never gives up on Commie peace talks. He the man. Period,” Locsin said in a tweet.
Locsin’s comment came in the wake of reports that Bello has conveyed to both Germany and the UK governments that the Philippines is willing to grant exemption from the deployment cap of Filipino health care workers should they agree to the vaccine request.Also part of Bello’s offer is the renewal of previous bilateral agreements with the two countries that cover the protection of Filipino workers.Bello, according to the report, had informed Germany and the UK that the Philippine government may exempt them from the deployment cap if they would agree to the agency’s requests, which include the renewal of previous bilateral agreements protecting OFWs.
The issue of placing a cap on Filipino nurses and HCWs seeking jobs abroad came to the fore at the height of the pandemic last year when the Philippines implemented a deployment restriction, especially on nurses to ensure a sufficient supply of health care professionals in the country. Demand for healthcare workers has increased over the years in some European countries and even in Japan due to their aging population.Meanwhile, the Philippine Nurses Association (PNA) called on the government to include the nurses in their negotiations with the labor-receiving countries to ensure that their welfare and interests are amply protected.PNA President Melbert Reyes also cautioned the government not to make it appear that Filipino nurses and health care workers are “mere commodities” that could be traded in exchange for the vaccines.“We would like to be part (of the negotiation). If there is such negotiation, there should be policies and guidelines to protect our nurses because we cannot just trade or send them in those countries,” Reyes told the Manila Bulletin in an interview.
If carefully handled, Reyes said the offer of Bello could turn out to be a “win-win” situation for the Philippines since it would be able to help the country hasten its vaccination program that has been delayed already.He likewise appealed to the government to put the nurses and other healthcare workers on the vaccine’s priority list.
“Of course we are concerned with our members. We are the frontliners and in direct contact with the patients,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Mayor Sara Duterte (Facebook / MANILA BULLETIN)
The city chief executive announced this as the country has yet to start its own COVID-19 vaccination program.
She said the local government opted to secure its own supply of COVID-19 vaccines in case the national government fails to deliver on its commitment to make the vaccines available for all.
She said the initial doses of AZD1222, the vaccine jointly developed by the British firm with Oxford University, can can benefit 15,000 individuals.Duterte added that they will procure additional vaccines developed by US-based Novavax Inc. and Serum Institute of India after receiving information that the local government units in the country can now place orders with the vaccine manufacturer.
“We are starting our documentation right now to buy a certain number of doses of Novavax. We’re buying these vaccines just in case the national government will not fulfill its commitment that there will be vaccines for all because there’s nothing on paper yet with regard to the number of doses that they can give to the LGUs,” she said.Duterte added that the city has been allocated an initial supply of 15,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccines that the national government will receive through the COVAX Facility, benefiting 7,500 individuals.
She said the local government is also asking private hospitals that serve as COVID-19 referral facilities in the city to submit names of their health care workers, who are willing to receive the vaccines, as the initial supply will be more than enough to cover all workers of the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC), which has around 5,000 employees.Duterte said the city’s public and private hospitals catering to COVID-19 patients have around 12,000 to 13,000 frontline healthcare workers, excluding those employed in standalone laboratories and allied medical services, who need to get vaccinated.The health care workers are at top of the government priority list for COVID-19 vaccination program, she said.

Senator Richard Gordon has urged the Senate to make sure that the bill seeking to expedite the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines will allow the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) to also procure them.
Senator Richard Gordon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
Gordon said Senate Bill No. 2057 or the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 should also cover international human organizations like the PRC, to ensure that the most vulnerable would be inoculated.
The senator, who is also chairman of the PRC, said the COVID-19 vaccines that would be procured by the organization would be administered also to individuals consistent with the government’s priority list set.“The idea is for them to get it from the Red Cross if we can get it, but they will have to donate one is to one. If they get one vaccine, they will donate one vaccine to the most vulnerable,” Gordon said.
“So, if they get 2,000 vaccines, they give us 2,000, which we can now distribute in accordance with the government plan to add to those who need it. This will now add more depth to our supply of vaccines and at the same time, expand it and make it faster,” he said, in proposing amendments to Section 5 of the bill.
Gordon also proposed that the Department of Health (DOH), the National Task Force against COVID-19 (NTF), local government units (LGUs), and private entities procuring COVID-19 vaccines may partner with the PRC in the administration or distribution, and inoculation of the vaccines.
He noted that, subject to certain conditions, the current Section 5 allows private entities to procure only in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through a multiparty agreement with the said agencies and the vaccine supplier.Under the bill, vaccines purchased by private entities shall also be for the sole and exclusive use of such companies, without prejudice to the multiparty agreement.

Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte has expressed frustration about the delay in the arrival of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine in the country as it affected the city’s own vaccination program rollout and the reopening of its economy.
Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte (QC PIO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“I would be lying to say that I’m not frustrated with the delay. We have already planned our vaccination program… We are very, very ready. Kulang na nga lang yung bakuna (What we just need is the vaccine),” Belmonte said in an interview with ANC Tuesday.
Belmonte made the remark as the arrival of vaccine was delayed due to the national government’s late submission of required indemnification agreement to vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and AstraZeneca and the late emergency authorization to Sinovac.Because of this, the Quezon City government now has to adjust its “calendar,” which initially aimed to achieve herd immunity by vaccinating 80 percent of the population or around 1.6 million people within six to eight months.
“We estimated a time of about six to eight months to achieve this [herd immunity]… Certainly, with this delay, and of course given the fact that Sinovac will not applicable to our health workers and to our senior citizens, I think this will require us again to change our vaccine program and shuffle it around,” the mayor said.
Belmonte added that aside from its calendar, the delay also affected the local governments’ bid to reopen the economy as “the riskiest population should be vaccinated first before we can really go about opening the economy.”
If Sinovac, which is still not recommended to health workers and senior citizens, will arrive first, “that means we will have to start with the non-so vulnerable sectors like the working essential workers,” Belmonte said.“But these are not really the one we should be protecting. It is the health workers and our senior citizens,” she said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sen. Risa Hontiveros made the appeal after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not recommend Sinovac for health workers, even though it has given the China-made vaccines an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Sinovac is also scheduled to arrive in the country as the first vaccine against COVID-19.The NTF, Hontiveros said, should still stick to the vaccination program as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) by speeding up the purchase agreements of vaccines that are effective for healthcare workers given their high exposure to COVID-19.
The senator warned that rearranging the priority list could lead to further compromise later on in the vaccination program.
“We have to remain faithful to the list from the very start. If not, this might lead to people cutting the line. Magkakagulo lang (There would be chaos),” Hontiveros said in a statement.
“Baka mahuli na naman ang health workers. Late na nga ang allowance ng frontliners, late pa yung bakuna. Wala ba tayong utang na loob sa healthcare workers natin (Our health workers may come in late again in the vaccination program. The allowance for our frontliners is already late, the vaccines would be late too. Don’t we owe our healthcare workers?),” she pointed out.Since Sinovac is also recommended only for 18 to 59 years old only, all the more should the NTF secure the purchase of sufficient quantities of other brands of vaccines, the lawmaker stressed.
She also said the NTF should be upfront about the status of its negotiations with vaccine manufacturers and suppliers.
“What’s the stage of our negotiation? Are we going to have a supply delivery soonest? Is the NTF dragging its feet because there is something slowing it down? The NTF should be thinking two steps ahead every time,” she reiterated.“After all they’ve done for us, the least we can do is make the health of our health workers a priority. Our healthcare system will completely collapse without their service and dedication,” she said.“Let’s ease their anxiety by making sure they can go home safely to their families soon.

Fisher’s group Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya) welcomed the government’s prioritization of fishers, farmers, and other economic frontliners in the nationwide inoculation.
“While we welcome the prioritization of fishers and farmers on the government’s massive vaccination campaign, we assert that the vaccine be totally free, safe, and effective,” said Fernando Hicap, Pamalakaya national chairperson.He told the Manila Bulletin that the COVID-19 vaccine “must be developed by established pharmaceutical companies to ensure the efficacy and safety of the vaccine.”
On Monday, Feb. 22, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said transport workers, farmers, fishermen and other essential workers will likely be among the economic frontliners who will be given priority in the distribution of vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech.
The Sinovac vaccines already have an emergency use approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but were not recommended to be used by healthcare workers and senior citizens due to varying levels of efficacy.“The national government’s crucial and urgent responsibility is to ensure that a large number of the population are immunized from the virus disease to let the displaced workers get back to the wheels of production and go on with lives,” Hicap said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

On February 17, 2021, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended a virtual UN Security Council Ministerial Open Briefing on COVID-19 Vaccine Issue in Beijing, and delivered a speech entitled “Strengthening Global Anti-pandemic Cooperation with a People-centered Approach”.
Wang Yi said, in the past seven months since the Security Council passed Resolution 2532 calling for a global ceasefire and stepping up efforts to fight the pandemic, more than 180 countries have endorsed the global ceasefire initiative, and the situation in Libya, Sudan and other countries has made significant progress, contributing to the international fight against the pandemic. Meanwhile, a new round of the pandemic is still spreading, and the vast majority of developing countries, especially countries caught in conflict and those affected by humanitarian crises, are facing difficult situations. We must redouble our efforts to make new contributions to fighting the pandemic and maintaining peace. Wang Yi put forward four points in this regard:
First, put people first and strengthen international cooperation against COVID-19. In the face of the pandemic, there is no principle more important than putting people first, and no other consideration that is given higher priority to than putting people’s lives first. This is a relay race to save lives together, not a zero-sum game in which one gains at the expense of the other. All countries should replace division with unity, and firmly follow the right path of cooperating to fight the pandemic and overcome difficulties together; replace prejudice with science, and combat all kinds of false information and attempts to politicize the pandemic. Security Council members must set an example in this regard.Second, fully implement Security Council resolutions and create an environment conducive to the fight against the pandemic. All parties to the conflict must earnestly abide by Security Council Resolution 2532, stay away from the battlefield, and participate in the battle against the pandemic. We should ensure humanitarian access, and give priority to helping vulnerable groups such as women and children. The UN should make good use of the ceasefire window, actively mediate and promote the political settlement process. China has always opposed unilateral sanctions that are not authorized by the Security Council and urges relevant countries to demonstrate humanitarianism and at least suspend unilateral coercive measures that are not based on international law.
Third, address the vaccine deficit and increase assistance to developing countries. The COVID-19 vaccine is being developed and produced at a record speed, but there are also problems that urgently need to be resolved. First, “capacity deficit”. For vaccines that have been used for emergencies and have received conditional marketing authorization, countries should not only rely on their own strength to increase the supply, but also actively carry out international cooperation such as commissioned production and joint production. Second, “access deficit”. Vaccines are entering high-income countries quickly and in large numbers, while poor countries have little access. This will not only lead to the “immunization gap” but also aggravate the “development gap”. All parties should come together to reject vaccine nationalism, promote fair and reasonable deployment of vaccines, and in particular, make them accessible and affordable for developing countries, including those in conflicts, so as not to let a country in need be left behind or let any people waiting for the vaccine be forgotten.
Fourth, strengthen overall coordination and give full play to the role of the UN system. All parties should continue to increase their political support and financial input to the World Health Organization (WHO), and in particular support the WHO to lead this largest immunization campaign in human history. The “COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility” (COVAX) should fully embody the principle of giving priority to developing countries and ensure the supply of conflict areas and sanctioned countries. The World Food Program, United Nations Children’s Fund, and other international organizations should build a green channel for the distribution of vaccines to developing countries, especially the “last kilometer” in Africa.
Wang Yi said, President Xi Jinping solemnly declared to the world that China’s vaccines will be a global public good, making China’s contribution to the realization of the availability and affordability of vaccines in developing countries. China has delivered on its commitments, and first joins the WHO-sponsored Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator initiative, actively develops vaccine R&D cooperation with over 10 countries, and joins and supports the COVAX to promote fair deployment of vaccines with practical actions. At the request of the WHO, China decided to provide 10 million doses of domestic vaccine to the COVAX to meet the urgent needs of developing countries. China has provided vaccine assistance to 53 developing countries that have made requests, and has exported vaccines to 22 countries. China actively leverages its advantages in the industrial chain to support and assist other countries in processing and producing vaccine products in China or locally to help increase global production capacity. China has decided to join the Friends of the COVID-19 Vaccine Group for peacekeepers and donate vaccines to UN peacekeepers.Wang Yi emphasized, China has never pursued any geopolitical goals in its international cooperation on the COVID-19 vaccine, never calculated any economic benefits, and never attached any political conditions. What we think about the most is to make vaccines public goods that are accessible and affordable to people in all countries, and make them truly become a people’s vaccine. China will continue to work with all parties to strengthen cooperation in vaccines, prevention and control and other fields, contribute to a global community of health for all, and win the final victory in the global fight against the pandemic.
Under the theme of “ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines in contexts affected by conflict and insecurity”, the meeting was hosted by the United Kingdom, the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council in February. Security Council members and UN Secretary-General António Guterres attended the meeting.

BOGOTA, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) — Colombian President Ivan Duque on Saturday welcomed the arrival of the first batch of vaccines from Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac, which will be “deployed throughout the national territory.”The president said that the vaccines will be sent to several remote regions of the country, especially to the border departments in the Amazon, to fight the variant of COVID-19 known as P.1.
Chinese Ambassador to Colombia Lan Hu, who was also present to welcome the arrival of the shipment, said the fight against the pandemic “has been the priority” of bilateral relations since last year and that the arrival of the vaccines represents an opportunity to help the country return to normality.
“We would also like to thank the government and the Colombian people for the confidence that they have placed in the Sinovac vaccine,” the ambassador said.
“We hope that this vaccine, as a global public good, can play a more positive role in this battle, in this fight, in this national vaccination plan to save more lives and to restore normality to our socioeconomic life as soon as possible,” he added.
In early February, Colombia’s National Food and Drug Surveillance Institute approved the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinovac. According to its National Vaccination Plan, healthcare workers and elders are among the first groups to be immunized.The Ministry of Health reported on Saturday that the number of deaths from COVID-19 in Colombia had risen to 58,685 and the total infections had increased to 2,222,018.

Responding positively to President Duterte’s call, the House of Representatives on Monday completed from second to final reading its approval of COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act 2021 that would help guarantee swift procurement of vaccines against the dreaded novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
(MANILA BULLETIN FILE)
Barely two hours after passing House Bill 8648 on second reading, the Lower House registered 225 affirmative and zero negative votes to pass the bill on third and final reading.Six members of the Makabayan bloc abstained from the voting.
HB 8648 proposes to exempt procurement ofCOVID-19 vaccines from the tedious and long process of public bidding as provided under Republic Act 9148 or the Government Procurement Law.The bill also provides an indemnity fund to compensate individuals who will suffer from side effects of COVID-19 vaccine inoculation.This also unburdens manufacturers from being held liable for such events.
“House Bill 8648, which I introduced in the House of Representatives, seeks to expedite the purchase and administration of vaccines to ensure that all Filipinos, particularly the elderly and those in the marginalized sectors, will be inoculated and protected from the deadly disease,” said Speaker Lord Allan Velasco.
The successive approvals of a bill is allowed only if the bill sought to be passed has been certified as an urgent administration measure by the President.
In the case of HB 8648, President Duterte sent to both the Senate and the Lower House his certification as to the urgency of the measure.Leaders of both Houses have reportedly agreed to pass similar bills to avoid the conduct of bicameral conference proceedings that will fine-tune the disagreeing provisions of the Lower House and Senate versions.
Before its approval on second reading, sponsors of HB 8648 presented an substitute bill that apparently contained provisions that are identical with the Senate version.
HB 8648 authorizes local government units to purchasevaccines for the protection of their respective constituents against the COVID-19.It also allows LGUs to advance down payments to foreign vaccine manufacturers of their choice.The down payment will not be more than 50 percent of the total contract price for the preferred vaccines.
The bill also exempts LGUs from payment of customs duties, value-added tax, excise tax and other fees for the procurement, importation, storage, transport, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“I’m appealing to the public for a little more patience. Rest assured that the vaccines will arrive,” he said during the “Laging Handa” public briefing Monday, Feb. 22.
Duque cited the global supply shortage as main reason for the delay.“The main reason why the vaccines have yet to arrive is the global supply shortage,” he said.
“In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) said 130 countries have yet to start their vaccine rollout,” added Duque.
He said the United Nations also reported that 10 countries used majority of the vaccines.Duque, however, expected that the vaccines were due to arrive soon such as the donated Sinovac vaccines.“Once there is already an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization), the Chinese Embassy is asking for three to five days to prepare for the delivery of the 600,000 vaccine doses,” he said.
Aside from this, Duque said, the government will also purchase additional doses of Sinovac, using the agency’s savings.
“We will import and purchase about 50,000 doses of Sinovac using our savings as recommended by the National Task Force,” he said.On Monday, Feb. 22,the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the granting of EUA to Sinovac.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Public Attorneys Office’s (PAO) mishandling of the Dengvaxia dengue vaccine case contributed to the delays in the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccines in the country, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said on Monday.
Senator Franklin Drilon
(Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Drilon pointed out that the requirement of vaccine manufacturers for an indemnification clause in the supply agreements for COVID-19 vaccines were borne out of the events that transpired in the Dengvaxia controversy.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez had earlier said manufacturers were seeking an indemnity agreement following news of arrest warrants being issued against Sanofi-Pasteur officials who were responsible in the inoculation of schoolchildren who suffered severe side effects after being vaccinated using the anti-dengue vaccine.“Why, suddenly, the manufacturers required an indemnity clause? Because of their experience on the way the Dengvaxia controversy was handled against Sanofi,” Drilon pointed out during an ANC Headstart interview.
“It should be looked at in the context of the way PAO Chief Persida Acosta handled the Dengvaxia controversy,” Drilon added.
He noted the PAO chief’s handling of the case burdened the poor health workers who were made defendants in the cases filed all over the country.
But given this unfortunate experience, Drilon said it is only proper to include a provision in Senate Bill No. 2057 or the bill expediting the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines that would shield volunteers, like health workers, who are authorized to carry out the inoculation program, from suits and liabilities, except in cases of willful misconduct.He clarified, however, that the free and harmless cause would apply only to vaccines validly procured, not to smuggled vaccines.
He also reiterated that the indemnity issue is not the only reason for the delay, citing the mismanagement in the country’s COVID-19 vaccination strategy.
“To me, this is not the only reason. I think just like the way COVID-19 pandemic was handled, there is mismanagement in handling the supply agreements,” he stressed. “Even the President asked: where are the vaccines? This is absolutely a sign of exasperation,” Drilon pointed out.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The revelry of critics on the delay of the coronavirus vaccines’ delivery will not last long, according to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque.

Roque announced Monday that the government will soon begin the immunization program after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the green light for the emergency use of Sinovac vaccines in the country.
The Palace admitted there has been a slight delay in the vaccine rollout but he rejected allegations the government bungled the procurement process. He attributed the vaccine delay to issues related to indemnity and regulatory approval.“We obviously disagree,” Roque said during a televised press briefing Monday, Feb. 22, when asked to comment on Senate Majority Franklin Drilon’s statement that the vaccine delay was due to mismanagement.
“Anyway, they are entitled to say what they want pero gaya ng aking sinabi sandali lang po ang kaligayahan ng ating mga kritiko dahil tuloy na po ang ating vaccination program (but like I said, the happiness of the critics will be short-lived because our vaccination program will push through). Enjoy it while it lasts for a very short while,” he added.
Mismanagement
In an interview over ANC Headstart Monday, Drilon said the delay in the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines was reportedly due to the mismanagement of the procurement process and not because of the lack of an indemnity law.
“We have to cue and we are last in the cue because of our failure to make an advance payment early enough. These alleged indemnity agreements are not the cause of these delays,” Drilon said.“The fact that this is only foisted to us last week is an indication that the supply agreement is not the cause of the delays. Unfortunately, I have already seen in the media some blame being put on Congress for failing to
pass this law. That’s totally unfair,” the minority leader added.
“It is the mismanagement of this entire process that caused the delay in our procurement,” he said.
Roque said, “‘Yung mga kritiko ng gobyerno, pasensiya na po, talaga pong naantala nang ilang araw pero tuloy na po ang bakuna (To government critics, bear with the slight delay in the vaccine delivery but the vaccination will proceed),” he added.On the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines covered by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) COVAX facility, Roque said the drug manufacturers first wanted an indemnity deal before the supplies are delivered to the country.
“Mayroon tayong liham, hindi made-deny ang liham na galing sa COVAX na mid-February darating yung Pfizer at saka AstraZeneca. Kaya lang po may mga natakot na manufacturers dahil dito lang sa Pilipinas nadedemanda ang mga bakuna na naaprubahan hindi lang FDA kung hindi WHO (We received a letter from COVAX facility that stated the delivery of Pfizer and AstraZeneca will begin in mid-February. But the manufacturers got scared because it is only in the Philippines where manufacturers can be sued for vaccines approved not only by (the) FDA but also by (the) WHO),” he said.
“Siyempre kailangan nila protektahan ang kanilang interes baka mamaya makulong sila, eh sila na nga gumagawa ng bakuna para sa COVID-19 (Of course, they wanted to protect their interest otherwise they might land in jail even if they developed the vaccines for COVID-19,” he added.
The FDA has issued the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the coronavirus vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech. The vaccines
however have not been recommended for the use of health workers due to
its 50.4 percent efficacy. Instead, the vaccines could be used by healthy persons aged 18 to 59.
With the FDA approval of Sinovac, Roque said around 600,000 vaccines, donated by China to the Philippines, are expected to be delivered to the
country in the coming days. China needed only three days to deliver
the supplies to the Philippines, he added. (With a report from Hannah

The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) welcomed on Monday, Feb. 22, the signing of the Memorandum Order 51 that authorizes Local Government Units (LGUs)to make advance payments for the purchase of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) vaccines, saying it will expedite the procurement to counter the threat of the fatal virus infection.
(JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)
On February 18, President Duterte signed M.O. 51 that allowed the local government units (LGUs) to make advance payments for the acquisition of COVID-19 vaccines that exceeds the 15 percent limit set under procurement laws.The Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Government Procurement Reform Act states that an advance payment “shall be made only after prior approval of the President and shall not exceed 15 percent of the contract amount, unless otherwise directed by the President.”DILG officer-in-charge (OIC) Bernardo C. Florece, Jr.said that this development will ascertain that both the national Task Force (NTF) and the LGUs will speed up the process of securing COVID-19 vaccines for their constituents.He added that M.O. 15 and the possible enactment of House Bill No. 8648 that would allow the importation of COVID-19 vaccines tax free and Senate Bill No.2057 seeking to fast-track the purchase and roll-out of COVID-19 together with the P500-million indemnification fund removes the barriers to the early delivery of vaccines to our country.
“M.O. 15 also authorizes the NTF and the Department of Health (DOH) to make advance payments exceeding 15 percent of the total contract amount for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.The said M.O. takes effect immediately after its issuance and will remain until the lifting of the State of Calamity due to COVID-19,’’ stated the DILG.
Florece reminded all LGUs that the procurement and payment of vaccines is subject to authorization from NTF COVID-19 chief Implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. as well as “subject to the criteria and limits to be identified by the NTF and Department of Health (DOH) consistent with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.”“We wish to remind the LGUs that all negotiations must follow the tripartite process involving the national government and the pharmaceutical companies they wish to purchase from,” Florece said.
Florece warned that “corruption has no place amid the COVID-19 pandemic and all those who will be proven to have engaged in illegal acts will be dealt with under the full power of the law.”SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The bill seeks to establish a vaccine indemnity fund and fast-track the procurement of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines, Go, chairman of the Senate health and demography committee, explained.
“Kami naman po, handa kaming talakayin ito at maipasa na kaagad… isa rin po ito sa mga requirements ng mga suppliers (ng bakuna mula) sa ibang bansa (We are ready to tackle and pass it immediately…this is also one of the requirements of the foreign suppliers of vaccine),” Go said during an ambush interview right after he assisted flood victims in Sto. Tomas, Davao del Norte on Saturday, February 20.Co-sponsored by Go, SB 2057 aims to hasten the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines by allowing local government units to (LGUs) procure vaccines and make advance payments, and to include an indemnification fund to cover the possible expenses and claims arising from adverse effects of the vaccines.
SB 2057 proposes the creation of a COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund which will be administered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and will be sourced from the 2021 national budget’s Contingent Fund.
“Kaya tayo naiipit dahil maraming mga requirements (sa pagkuha ng bakuna)… na hinihingi ng mga manufacturers dahil takot po sila, dahil rin sa nangyari sa Dengvaxia, na sila po ang babalikan at sila ang idedemanda (We are being delayed due the several requirements in securing the vaccine…that are being demanded by the manufacturers for fear, for what had happened in the case of Dengvaxia, that charges will be filed against them [in case some negative effects occur),” Go said.
“So, tayo naman, kami bilang mambabatas, at ang Executive naman po, is working hand in hand para po mapabilis ‘yung proseso at dumating na po ‘yung bakuna (So, we as legislators, and the executive, are working hand in hand to hasten the process and the arrival of the vaccine),” he added.Meanwhile, Go continues to encourage Filipinos to trust the government and COVID-19 vaccines in an effort to boost public vaccine confidence.
“I encourage my fellow Filipinos, magtiwala po tayo sa gobyerno, magtiwala po tayo sa ginagawang bakuna ng mga manufacturers (trust the government, let us also trust the manufacturers of the vaccines),” Go stated.
“Hindi naman po bibili ang ating gobyerno kung mayro’n pong diperensya ‘yan. Eh ‘yun lang po ang ating susi para unti-unti tayong makabalik sa ating normal na pamumuhay katulad noon (The government will not procure [the vaccine] if it is defective. That is the only key for us to slowly return to our normal lives as it were before),” he added.
Go said that trust in the government and in concerned officials is necessary for the country to finally recover from the pandemic.“Kung gusto n’yong bumalik sa normal ang ating pamumuhay, magtiwala po tayo sa gobyerno. Magtiwala tayo kay Pangulong Duterte, magtiwala tayo kay Secretary (Carlito) Galvez at ginagawa naman po ng gobyerno ang lahat sa abot po ng ating makakaya, para sa Pilipino (If you want to go back to our normal way of living, trust the government.

Forty homeless people in Saint Petersburg received coronavirus vaccine jabs on Sunday, under a charity initiative that hasreceived the backing of local officials.
“Here there are many people at risk. It is important for them to be vaccinated,” said Taysia Suvorova, of the Nochlezhka non-governmental thatorganisation provides aid to the homeless in Russia’s second city.
The 40 people receiving the vaccine are currently housed by the charity.According to official figures there are 15,000 homeless people in the former imperial capital, out of a total population of five million.
Nochlezhka believes the real figure is at least double that.
“Some people have been saying controversial things about the vaccine, but I think there are more advantages than negatives,” 57-year-old Galina Ivanovna told AFP, after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.
“I’m pretty happy to do it,” she added.Fellow recipient Aleksandr Suvorov, 60, echoed her sentiment, adding that the vaccine was a good thing “because the situation is complicated with coronavirus”.
An NGO has already launched a similar initiative for the homeless in Moscow, aided by the authorities in the Russian capital.
Russia registered its first coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, back in August.A second Russian vaccine , EpiVacCorona, was approved in October 2020. The country officially launched its programme of mass vaccinations in January.

SPEAKING OUT
Ignacio R. Bunye
For two consecutive weeks, Muntinlupa City held virtual town hall meetings to drum up participation in its forthcoming COVID vaccination program. Invited to the meetings with the theme “Bakunado, Protektado” were representatives of homeowners groups, religious groups, civic groups, Sangguniang Kabataan, the Gender Development Office, and the City Administrator’s Office.
During the first meeting held February 10, the resource speakers were Infection Prevention and Control Committee Chair Charissa Borja-Tabora of Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and Jesusa Joyce Cirunay of the Food and Drug Administration. Ms. Borja-Tabora underscored the safety of vaccines, the process of clinical trials, and the role of vaccines in protecting individuals and communities. Ms. Cirunay discussed the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization and the stringent process and policies for the approval of vaccines.During the second meeting held last Thursday, Dr. Jose Mari Castro of the Department of Health shared his insights on the nature of COVID 19, means of transmission and safeguards to protect oneself and the community.
A special feature of both town hall meetings was an AVP specially prepared by the Public Information Office, headed by Tez V. Navarro, explaining the need to have oneself vaccinated. The AVP also answered frequently asked questions regarding the safety of FDA-approved vaccines.In a February 11 COVID survey involving 17,561 respondents from Muntinlupa’s nine barangays, 4,484 respondents or 24 percent indicated they were not willing to be vaccinated. The most common reasons cited were fear of side effects, doubts about the efficiency rate of the vaccine, and cost of vaccination, exacerbated obviously by conflicting information circulating in social media.
Dr. Teresa “Tet” Tuliao, Muntinlupa City CHO, is targeting 383,000 or 70 percent of the entire city population – the minimum number for Muntinlupeños to be able to gain “herd immunity”.Dr. Tuliao said the city has identified 6,758 medical front-liners from barangay health centers, emergency responders, the Ospital ng Muntinlupa, and six private hospitals, including Asian Hospital, who can inject the vaccines. They will be organized into 82 vaccinations teams and deployed in 35 vaccination posts. They have the capability of vaccinating 8,200 individuals per day.
Muntinlupa City will give priority to front-liners such as health workers and uniformed personnel. Next in line are indigent senior citizens, followed by other senior citizens.
Vaccination during Spanish times
At various periods during the Spanish era, the Philippines was hit by smallpox, bubonic plague, and cholera and it was interesting how the authorities dealt with them.
In the 1800s, smallpox infected most of the Spanish territories, in South America and the Philippines. According to historian Ambeth Ocampo, the then reigning Spanish monarch, Carlos IV, ordered a vaccination expedition to head for the territories in 1803. The group was headed by Francisco Javier de Balmis.
In the late 1700s, Spain already had a vaccine for smallpox and in fact Carlos IV had his immediate family inoculated. But the problem was how to transport the vaccine because of the long voyage involved. Balmiscame up with the novel idea of using live carriers. From Spain to Mexico and from Mexico to Manila, Balmis used orphans working a relay system. During the voyage, Balmis transmitted the vaccine in sequence, from child to child, arm to arm, along the way to their destination.
To cut a long story short, Balmis and his boys eventually reached Manila in 1805. The Spanish Governor-General Rafael Aguilar immediately had his own children inoculated. Thiss oftened the initial resistance of Bishop Domingo Collantes, the Archbishop of Manila, who was not keen on vaccination. Eventually, Balmis inoculated 20,000 inhabitants in Manila and environs. Balmis’ assistants later proceeded to Misamis and Zamboanga. From Manila, Balmis brought Filipino orphans to Macau and Canton for a similar inoculation exercise.
A bronze monument of Carlos IV, in front of the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, and a historical marker at the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine commemorate the Balmis vaccination expedition.Note: You may wish to share the foregoing article via Facebook, Twitter or Linked-In.

Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara on Sunday said the indemnity provision of the bill proposing to fast track the procurement of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines is meant only to free vaccine manufacturers from any liability should their products cause side effects.
Sen. Sonny Angara (Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Angara stressed that the inclusion of such provision is not in anticipation that Filipinos will develop such side effects.The indemnification fund will just be a guaranteethat the government would be ready to shoulder the responsibility in case of any possible untoward event that would happen in administering the vaccine. “The indemnification is just something the manufacturers want to secure to make sure that if someone gets sick because of the vaccine, it would be the government that purchased the vaccine that would accept responsibility,” Angara said in an interview over Radio DZBB.Angara pointed out that since vaccine development usually takes up to Phase 4 clinical trials, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have already given emergency use authority for some vaccines even without completing all phases.
“This indemnity is what the manufacturers were asking from us, because they know that these vaccines were manufactured in a rush and the government is asking it because we are in an emergency situation, we are under a pandemic,” he pointed out.
Angara, chairman of the Senate finance committee and sponsor of Senate Bill No. 2057, said this does not mean Filipinos will definitely develop serious side effects when they take the vaccines.
“This was only asked by some manufacturers that sell the vaccines especially those that are under the COVAX facility,” he said.The measure primarily seeks to expedite the procurement of the COVID-19 vaccines by empowering local government units (LGUs) to make advance payments to purchase the vaccines. The same bill also seeks to establish a P500-million national indemnity fund to compensate inoculated persons who would experience serious side effects or, possibly, death.

Recognizing many people are already growing impatient, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque assured the public that the much-awaited coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines are coming soon.

Roque made the statement when he made a guest appearance on the country’s longest-running noontime show “Eat Bulaga!” Saturday, Feb. 20, and played in the “Bawal Judgmental” segment.
Before Roque started testing his intuition, comedian and program host Vic Sotto asked Roque about the recent developments in the government’s vaccine procurement efforts.“‘Wag po kayong mag-alala, meron lang konting hitches, pero paparating na rin po ang bakuna para tayo ay magbalik-buhay (Do not worry, there are just a few hitches but the vaccine are arriving soon so we can go back to our normal lives),” Roque said.
“Pangako po ‘yan (That’s a promise),” he added.
Roque explained that the delivery of the vaccines was delayed because pharmaceutical firms like Pfizer and AstraZeneca required an indemnification agreement. He said the vaccine manufacturers were wary because of the Dengvaxia controversy where drug manufacturer Sanofi was dragged into a legal mess over the reported deaths linked to the dengue vaccine.
“Gusto nila ngayon eh magkaroon ng assurance na hindi mangyari yung nangyari sa Dengvaxia na dinemanda yung gumawa ng bakunang yun (They wanted an assurance that there will not be a repeat of the Dengvaxia mess),” he said.The Palace official likewise assured the public that they will not be given life-threatening vaccine shots.
“Hindi naman po ‘yan ibibigay sa kanila nang hindi dumaan sa masusing pagsusuri at mga eksperto po ang nagsabi na ligtas at epektibo ‘yan (The vaccines will not be given to them without the shots undergoing scrutiny and experts have said that the vaccines are safe and effective),” Roque said.
“So pagdating po ng bakuna, pila-pila na tayo sa bakuna dahil ‘yan talaga ang magiging solusyon dito sa ating pandemyang COVID-19 (So once the vaccine arrives, let’s all line up to get vaccinated because this is really the solution to the COVID-19 pandemic),” he added.On Feb. 18, President Duterte certified as urgent the bills seeking to establish an indemnity fund for those getting the COVID-19 vaccines.
According to Roque, the government will set aside P500 million for the vaccine recipients who may show adverse side effects after getting the shot.
Talks about the indemnification agreement surfaced after Pfizer and AstraZeneca, two pharmaceuticals that received an EUA from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), required such an agreement before the vaccine doses could be delivered.
On Feb. 17, Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said that the national government has finally submitted the required indemnification agreement to the two vaccine manufacturers. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

US President Joe Biden used a visit Friday to a Pfizer factory manufacturing coronavirus vaccines to reassure Americans that the shots are safe and hold the key to beating the pandemic.
US President Joe Biden tours the Pfizer Kalamazoo manufacturing site in Michigan
Biden, who has made getting COVID-19 under control his top task since taking office a month ago, addressed Americans skeptical about the medicines, which were produced at record speed in response to the global health crisis.
“The vaccines are safe. Please, for yourself, your family, your community, this country, take the vaccine when it’s your turn and it’s available. That’s how we beat this pandemic,” he said against a backdrop of Pfizer’s gleaming manufacturing equipment at the Michigan facility.Biden said companies making the vaccines are “fastidious” and “it takes more time to do the check for safety than it does to make the vaccine. That’s how fastidious they are.”
“If there’s one message to cut through to everyone in the country, it’s this: Vaccines are safe,” he added.
Biden said the program to deliver the vaccines into people’s arms is as complicated as the already intense challenges of manufacturing in huge quantities at speed.
“There has never, ever, ever been a logistical challenge as consequential as what we’re trying to do, but we’re getting it done,” he said.
According to Biden, his goal of administering a million shots a day for a total of 100 million in the first 100 days of his presidency is on track to be easily surpassed, with a current average of 1.7 million vaccines a day.
With the death toll set soon to pass 500,000 in the United States, Biden said he did not want to give firm predictions of when the crisis will be curbed.
However, he said that 600 million doses — enough to cover most of the country — were expected to be ready by the end of July.“I believe we’ll be approaching normalcy by the end of this year. God willing, this Christmas will be different to last, but I can’t make that commitment,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Presidential Security Group (PSG) personnel who were inoculated with an unregistered coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine last year haven’t experienced any adverse effect and are now considered “safe” from the dreaded disease, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) bared Friday, February 19.
Major Gen. Edgard Arevalo, AFP spokesperson, said they haven’t recorded any adverse effect so far among the PSG personnel who volunteered to be administered with the vaccine, which did not have the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval.“We are pleased that the PSG personnel who have volunteered to be vaccinated in the pursuit of their mission to protect the President did not only perform a selfless act, they were also safe as an aftermath of the inoculation,” he said in a statement.Arevalo gave the update nearly two months after it was revealed that some members of the military were already inoculated with an unregistered vaccine, even as the FDA had yet to approve the use of any brand at the time.Although Duterte initially said in a Cabinet meeying that “many Filipinos” had already been vaccinated, it was AFP Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, who was then the Commanding General of the Philippine Army, who made the specific revelation about the inoculation of several military personnel.
The AFP investigated the incident and found out that members of the PSG, particularly the close-in security detail of Duterte, were the ones given the first vaccine shots.The issue placed the AFP in a bad light as the national government was criticized for supposedly prioritizing the uniformed personnel over medical frontliners in its vaccination plan.
The FDA and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) also called for an investigation to determine how the vaccines, which it described as smuggled, managed to enter the country.
Arevalo said the AFP is also waiting for the arrival of the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines in the country, which may happen later this month.
He said that this time, the AFP has no canvass yet of military personnel who are willing to get vaccinated.“As professional soldiers, we toe the line of the AFP leadership of being inoculated with what are BFAD-approved [Bureau of Food and Drugs] vaccines to be able to better perform our mandate,” Arevalo said.
“But we are mindful to give priority to the medical/health frontliners among us,” he said, noting that about 25 percent of the 180,000-strong AFP are consisted of medical frontliners. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

With the unsatisfactory trust rate in the national vaccination program, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), local government units (LGUs) and uniformed personnel have launched a massive information drive to entice the qualified recipients to be vaccinated as the country continues its battle against the coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19).
DILG Undersecretary and spokesperson Jonathan Malaya maintained Friday, Feb. 19, the need to counter vaccine hesitancy among some sectors of the public even if the demand for the COVID-19 dose has steadily increased.

Despite the rise in COVID-19 trust rate, Malaya said there is still a lot of disinformation and fake news being circulated by anti-vaxxers and by the misinformed as this will be “countered head-on by the information drive.’’He noted that the DILG is working closely with the Department of Health (DOH) and Philippine Information Agency (PIA) in mobilizing all LGUs and all DILG attached agencies especially the uniformed personnel from the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) to inform as many Filipinos about the benefits and risks of vaccines, including the processes involved to deliver these vaccines to them.
“We are mobilizing all our DILG field officers down to the municipal level and all our chiefs of police, jail wardens, and fire marshals so that they become vaccination champions. Through a series of webinars and dialogues with health experts, we will equip them in their new role as vaccination champions in their respective communities,” Malaya said.
Malaya admitted that there is much to be done to generate demand.
“Based on the latest data from OCTA, vaccine hesitancy is at 23 perccent-40 percent depending on the location and circumstances. The good news is that after our town hall meetings, demand increases up to 99 percent so an information drive is instrumental to increase vaccination uptake,” he added.
“We urge all LGUs to hold barangay assemblies, town hall meetings and make full use of social media to promote vaccination,” said Malaya.Under DILG Memorandum Circular 2021-019 signed by DILG officer-in-charge Bernardo Florece, all LGUs are directed to lead in local demand generation to improve vaccine confidence in their respective communities.
In the same memo, all local chief executives and their local health committees and communication arms were directed to establish local vaccination operations centers with a dedicated Communications, Advocacy and Partnership Team that shall lead the demand generation and communication activities on the local level.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Top officials of the National Task Force (NTF) Against Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) are planning to go to India to discuss the possible early delivery of Novavax vaccines to the Philippines, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said Friday, Feb. 19.

This, as Galvez said that the separate deal the government has with the Covax facility–led by the World Health Organization (WHO)–for the delivery of the American-made Pfizer-BioNTech and British, Swedish-made AstraZeneca vaccines is still being negotiated.
“We are trying our best, maybe one of these days we might go to India where more or less two to three billion doses will be produced by the Serum Institute of India. It is where we bought a big bulk of Novavax vaccines,” Galvez said during a visit of the Coordinated Operations to Defeat Epidemic (CODE) Team in the municipality of Pateros.The country was assured of at least 30 million doses of Novavax vaccines, to be delivered possibly in July 2021, by the Serum Institute of India.
Meanwhile, NTF officials and Philippine Ambassador to United States Jose Manuel Romualdez met with Covax and Gavi executives on Friday to talk about the status of their deals after the government signed indemnification agreements to ensure the delivery of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines within the first and second quarter of 2021 — possibly the latest of which is late February.
The indemnification agreements will ensure that the manufacturers will be free from “unnecesary” litigation should adverse effects are observed from patients inoculated with the vaccines, Galvez explained.
Galvez did not divulge other details of the meeting but he said Gavi executives from New York assured them that the Philippines is “almost on top of the priorities” of the Covax facility.“Our negotiation with the Covax facility is still ongoing. We are hopeful that the Covax will fulfill their commitment to bring us their 44 million doses in the first and second quarter [of 2021],” he said.
The indemnification requirement is supposedly one of the reasons why the slated delivery of 117,000 doses of Pfizer jabs to the country by mid-February was delayed.
Galvez said the Dengvaxia dengue vaccine mess in 2017 played a big part why manufacturers are more careful now in entering deals with countries with no indemnification law, such as the Philippines.While the government has already signed the indemnification requirements of Covax, Galvez said separate agreements will have to be made with the Pfizer-BioNTEch and AstraZeneca since they also have separate bilateral deals with them for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.
NTF officials led by Galvez will meet with Pfizer executives on Monday, Feb. 21, to discuss their indemnification requirements while the NTF’s meeting with AstraZeneca executives has yet to be announced. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

So how does Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles try to convince Filipinos that the vaccines are safe to take? He got creative and used TikTok to dance and spread the word about the government’s vaccination program.Five amateur dance videos related to vaccine information have so far been posted by the former Davao lawmaker, who has more than 24,000 followers on TikTok.The same TikTok videos were shared on his Instagram page.Nograles, also co-chairs the government task force in charge of making policies related to pandemic response, is known for his fondness for dancing.
Appearing in casual clothes and sneakers, Nograles started taking on dance challenges on TikTok, the popular short form social media app, early this month while promoting the immunization drive. As he danced to catchy tunes, he answered questions to address vaccine concerns and promote public confidence.
Nograles’ first vaccine-related TikTok dance video was about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. The video he uploaded has so far earned more than 7,000 views.
“Bago aprubahan ng FDA (Food and Drug Admnistration), dadaan muna ang mga bakuna sa masusing pagsusuri ng DOST-Vaccine Expert Panel. I-momonitor naman ng Adverse Effect Following Immunization Committee ang mga aprubadong bakuna upang masigurong ligtas at epektibo ang mga ito (Before the FDA gives an approval, the vaccines must pass the thorough check of the DOST-Vaccine Expert Panel. The Adverse Effect Following Immunization Committee will then monitor the approved vaccines to ensure they are safe and effective),” the message in the video read.
Another video showed Nograles grooving to the popular song “Dancing In My Room” while addressing a query if vaccines will eventually be sold in pharmacies and clinics.
“Sa ngayon, tanging ang gobyerno lang ang authorized na bumili at mangasiwa ng mga COVID-19 vaccines. Habang wala pang ful market authorization mula sa FDA, ang COVID-19 vaccine ay hindi maaaring inbenta sa publiko (At present, only the govenrment is authorized to buy and administer COVID-19 vaccines. While there is no full market authorization from the FDA, the COVID-19 vaccine cannot be sold to the public),” he said.
Herd immunity was the next topic of Nograles’ third video. He danced to Wale’s song “Lotus Flower Bomb” while explainingthat this referred to the buildup of immunity of a large population from an infectious disease. The video was viewed more than 42,000 times.
Nograles’ fourth dance video was so far the most popular with more than 91,000 views. The video, posted a week ago, tackled the list of beneficiaries of the vaccines while Nograles danced to 1096 Gang’s “Pajama Party.”
When a netizen asked about the assurance there will be no VIP treatment on who first gets the vaccine, Nograles said the priority will be given to healthcare and frontline workers, vulnerable sectors like senior citizens, and essential workers.
Nograles posted his fifth dance video on TikTok early this week, joining the #BIDADanceChallenge to raise awareness against the coronavirus.
“B-awal walang mask; I-sanitize ang mga kama; D-umistansya ng 1 meter; A-lamin ang totoong impormasyon; Suportahan ang FDA-approved na bakuna,” the message read.
With more than 550,000 confirmed cases across the country and counting, the government has been struggling to curb the spread of pandemic, and mitigate its impact on the economy and the people.
Faced with an economic downturn and rising hunger, the government is studying the proposal to further ease movement restrictions, particularly, placing the entire country under the most relaxed community quarantine status by March. ThePresident will have the final say on the matter.
The government has likewise pinned its hopes on the coronavirus vaccines to help bring back a semblance of normalcy in the country. Vaccine supplies have been secured by the government, but delivery has been derailed due to logistical and regulatory issues. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. (PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“Not true. We were among the first to react in that (vaccine) and other anti-Covid aspects. But feared mistakes too much. Natural,” Locsin said in a tweet.
When confronted by a netizen about Galvez’s direct admission, Locsin maintained that the cabinet members hit their targets when all of them were called by President Duterte to “get going.”“No, we were not. Duterte called the Cabinet and each of us to get going; I did, and so did Del (Defense Sec. Lorenzana), (Finance Sec. Carlos) Dominguez, everybody whose department was involved in the Covid fight. All of us hit our targets… and then… Es la vida loca (the crazy life),” he said.
Even former Commission on Elections Commissioner Gregorio Larrazabal called Locsin’s attention by quoting exactly what Galvez said in a media interview, to which Locsin replied, “I was being nice about ball dropping.”
In a post on Twitter, Larrazabal argued that some might have acted fast “but others didn’t, and because of their delay, inaction or ball-dropping, we’re late.”
In December last year, the foreign secretary pinpointed Health Secretary Francisco Duque III as the one who had “dropped the ball” in the country’s COVID-19 vaccine negotiations with American drug maker Pfizer.He, however, said the public “can’t keep on blaming,” adding he is more interested in results moving forward.
“I’m not interested in recriminations, I’m interested in results,” Locsin… We can’t keep blaming,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“Janssen has already started with the clinical trial proper; patients screening, recruitment, and vaccination,” said DOST Undersecretary Rowena Guevarra in a press briefing hosted by the Department of Health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the application of Janssen to hold clinical trials in the country on Dec. 29, 2020. It is a Belgium-basedpharmaceutical company, which is owned by American firm Johnson & Johnson.Guevarra said that they cannot reveal the total number of participants and the specific sites where the trials are being held. In a clarificatory statement, the DOST said that the trial sites were located in the National Capital Region, Calabarzon, and Western Visayas.The FDA also approved the clinical trial applications of two Chinese firms: Sinovac Biotech and Clover Pharmaceuticals. Both have yet to start their trials.
“For Clover and Sinovac, site preparations are ongoing. For the WHO (World Health Organization) Solidarity Trial [for vaccines], we are still waiting for the standard operating procedure and the name of the vaccine (which will be used),” said the DOST official.
Guevarra said that there are still some pharmaceutical companies who are expressing their interests to hold clinical trials here for their respective COVID-19 vaccines.“Ang daming mga bilateral partners that are still keen in holding clinical trials. However, one of the things we are looking at is that we are waiting for their Phase 3 applications. Kasi madami dito sa mga vaccine na dinedevelop, nasa Phase 1 and Phase 2 pa lang. And our preference is that we only participate in the Phase 3 clinical trial (Many bilateral partners are still keen in holding clinical trials. However, one of the things we are looking at is that we are waiting for their Phase 3 applications. Because many of the vaccines that are currently being developed are still in Phase 1 and Phase 2. And our preference is that we only participate in the Phase 3 clinical trials),” she said.
Guevarra said that the Philippines should continue to consider participating in clinical trials.
“So far, the vaccines approved are still in emergency use authorization (EUA) and having an EUA does not guarantee that they will be granted full marketing approval by the FDA in the future. Second, there is a need to generate vaccine efficacy and safety data specific to the Filipino population,” she said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Duterte signed Memorandum Order No. 51 last Feb. 18 “granting authority to local government units (LGUs) to make advance payments for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.”
Leonardia said it is a giant leap towards accelerating the implementation of local vaccination programs, adding that this city is among the top five direct beneficiaries along with Davao, Quezon, Makati, and Manila for having the biggest volume of allocated vaccine supply.The League took initiatives in encouraging cities to procure their vaccines to ensure that the target population is vaccinated.
“We are very thankful to President Rodrigo Duterte for the timely issuance of Memorandum Order 51,” Leonardia said.
He also said that this has a direct impact, especially to cities which had earlier signed the multilateral agreement with the Department of Health (DoH), National Task Force Against COVID-19, and AstraZeneca. “But this will, more importantly, benefit all LGUs similarly situated,” he added.
Leonardia said the city government is preparing the advance payment of 20 percent, as per contract, of the total cost of 650,000 doses of vaccines it will procure from AstraZeneca.“We make sure the city will settle the payment before the deadline to ensure that we get the delivery of the vaccines starting the third quarter of this year,” the Bacolod mayor added.

Go said while he and Duterte are willing to make their vaccination public, they prefer to allow frontliners to be given priority.
“Ayaw po namin ma una, gusto po naming mauna ang mga frontliners, gusto po naming mauna po ang ating mga mahihirap na kababayan lalong-lalo na po sa mga malalayong lugar yung mga pinakasulok na mga kababayan natin na hindi alam kung saan kukuha ng vaccine (We do not want to be the first to be vaccinated,we want the frontliners to be prioritize and the poor people expecially those in the far-flung areas who do not know where to get the vaccine),” he said.

Just because one is a doctor he can already comment on the vaccines),” he said Friday morning.“Magtiwala naman tayo sa mga eksperto dahil sa panahon ng health emergency, sino pang paniniwalaan natin kundi ang mga dalubhasa (Let’s have faith in experts because, in this time of a health emergency, there’s no one we can trust except the experts),” he added.
According to Roque, all experts agree that getting the COVID-19 vaccine jab has more benefits even though no vaccine brand has been authorized for commercial use yet.
“Lahat naman po sila ay nagsasabi na bagama’t emergency use authorization (EUA), eh mas marami ang mga benepisyo makukuha natin sa mga bakuna laban sa COVID-19 kaysa doon sa kanilang mga posibleng side effects (All of the experts agreed that even with just the EUA, there are more benefits in getting vaccinated against COVID-19 than the possible side effects),” he said.
On February 15,President Duterte ordered Roque and Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. to hold programs at least two times a week to inform the public about the government’s vaccination program against COVID-19, noting the public’s hesitation about the vaccines.Duterte himself finally agreed to have himself vaccinated against COVID-19 in public due to public clamor and to help boost the public’s confidence in the vaccine.
“That (President Duterte’s decision) is, of course, in recognition of the fact na nag-aantay ng senyales ang taumbayan kung talagang sila ay magpapabakuna o hindi (the public is waiting for a sign if they should get the vaccine or not),” Roque said.
“Ninanais po ni Presidente na lahat ng mga Pilipino ay magkaroon ng kompyansa na magpabakuna dahil ang bakuna po ang solusyon dito sa pandemya ng COVID-19 (The President wants all Filipinos to have confidence in getting the vaccine because it is the solution to the COVID-19 pandemic),” he added.The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) reported this month that only 3 out of 10 Metro Manila residents are willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine jabs.

President Joe Biden will pledge $4 billion in US aid to the Covax global COVID-19 vaccination program during his virtual meeting with other G7 leaders on Friday, White House officials said.

An initial $2 billion will be released “by the end of this month,” with the rest coming over the next two years, said a senior White House official, who asked not to be identified, on Thursday.
Covax is a global project to procure and distribute coronavirus vaccines for at least the most vulnerable 20 percent in every country, allowing poorer nations to catch up with the rush by dozens of wealthy countries to vaccinate.“The United States is really excited to be making our first contribution to Covax,” the White House official said. “We do think it is vital to take a role in beating the pandemic globally.”
Although the United States is “prioritizing” domestic needs, assistance to other countries “decreases the risk to everyone in the world, including Americans, and also decreases the risk of variants,” the official said.
For now, the focus is on contributing funds for purchase of new vaccines but “when we have a sufficient supply it is our intention to consider donating surplus vaccines,” the official said.
Group of Seven leaders will be discussing international coordination on ending the deadly and disruptive pandemic when they meet virtually on Friday. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The World Health Organization on Thursday urged COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers to make good on their commitments as the planet’s poorest countries await their first doses.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the Covax facility — the global COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distribution effort ensuring poorer countries can access doses — was now ready to begin.

Around 336 million AstraZeneca-Oxford doses and 1.2 million Pfizer-BioNTech doses — the only two vaccines with WHO approval — are set to start being shipped out later this month through Covax.“At the beginning of the year I issued a call to action to ensure that vaccination of health workers was under way in all countries within the first 100 days of the year,” Tedros told a news conference.
Friday “marks the half-way point, and we have made progress, but we are not there yet.
“With the emergency use listing of two versions of the AstraZeneca vaccine this week, Covax is ready to roll out vaccines and is waiting for several manufacturers to make good on their commitments,” he said, without elaborating.
Concerns for small states
On Monday, the WHO gave the seal of approval to the AstraZeneca vaccine being manufactured in plants in India and South Korea, meaning it can now be shipped out via Covax.The facility is set to issue its final distribution list for the first wave of deliveries next week. The first doses will be delivered by the end of February, with the bulk in March.
Around 145 economies are set to receive enough doses to immunise 3.3 percent of their collective population by mid-2021.
During his news conference, Tedros noted that countries in Europe — which have been striking their own deals with manufacturers — were aiming to vaccinate 70 percent of their populations in a similar same time frame.Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Keith Rowley, chairman of CARICOM, the 15-member Caribbean Community, voiced fears that small states, lacking bargaining power, would be shut out of the global vaccination drive.
‘Invisible destroyer’
“As there is the understandable rush to receive the vaccines and inoculation of our various populations, we are more than a little bit concerned that there is, or is to be, hoarding and price-gouging as well as undue preference in some quarters,” Rowley told the WHO press conference, via video-link.
“We are all yoked to an invisible destroyer. It is my hope and plea that… on this occasion, the rich take care of the poor.
“All we ask as members of the family of nations is that we not be forgotten, ignored — or worse, taken advantage of in this business of life and death.”
The WHO launched its annual Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for 2021 on Thursday, saying $1.96 billion was needed to fund another year of battling the pandemic.The plan’s six objectives are to suppress transmission; reduce exposure; counter misinformation; protect the vulnerable; reduce death and illness; and accelerate equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics.

Energy Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi (Photo credit: https://www.doe.gov.ph)
It has been widely reported that the COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at a certain low temperature, or else they would spoil in a matter of hours. This means that stable power is an absolute necessity in order to prevent wastage of the precious vaccines.
“We have to make sure that there is a continuous supply of electricity services. The DOE has been strategizing on how to pre-empt possible issues and concerns that may arise during the rollout,” Cusi said in a statement Thursday, Feb. 18.The directive was contained in a Department of Energy (DOE) advisory dated Feb. 16, 2021. It said that the rollout will be undertaken by the Duterte administration by the end of the first quarter this year.
In the advisory, Cusi ordered all DUs to ensure continuous, reliable, and stable power supply for COVID-19 vaccine cold storage and health care facilities through back-up generating sets and/or distribution system configuration.
He further instructed them to update their emergency response protocols and Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) in order to ensure the prioritization of the COVID-19 vaccines’ cold storage facilities in cases of power outages.
DUs, the DOE said, should also have enough contracted capacities for energy. Further, all DUs shall intensify vegetation management programs to eliminate power interruptions, and shall provide the necessary support for COVID-19 vaccine storage and healthcare facilities by installing their own back-up supply.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Christopher “Bong” Go on Thursday lauded President Duterte for certifying as urgent administration bill the measure expediting the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines which is now pending in Congress.
WANG ZHAO AFP/File
Go was referring to Senate Bill No. 2057 under Committee Report No. 185, entitled “An Act Expediting the Procurement and Administration of Vaccines for the Protection Against COVID-19, Providing Funds Thereof, and for Other Purposes.”
The said bill also includes provisions creating the Vaccine Indemnification Fund, which the government’s task force against COVID-19 has requested from lawmakers.“Importante na maisabatas ito sa lalong madaling panahon dahil malaking parte ito ng ating (It’s very important to expedite its passage into law because this will be a huge part in our ) National COVID-19 Vaccine Roadmap upang tuloy-tuloy na ang pag-roll-out ng mga bakuna sa ating bansa (so our that our vaccine program roll-out across the country would be smooth),” Go said in a statement.The Senate, led by the Senate Committee on Finance chaired by Sen. Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, is expected to approve the measure on Monday, Feb. 22.
Go also welcomed the President’s Memorandum Order granting authority to the National Task Force against COVID-19 and the Department of Health (DOH) to make advance payments exceeding 15 percent of the total contract amount in procuring the vaccines.“With this Memorandum Order, LGUs (local government units) allowed to procure COVID-19 vaccines under existing laws and issuances may make advance payments even exceeding the 15 percent limit provided they are authorized to do so by the chief implementer,” he said.
“Indeed, LGUs are capacitated under this Memorandum Order to procure COVID-19 vaccines to supplement the national government’s COVID-19 vaccination program,” he said.
The administration lawmaker said the only thing he hopes that the LGUs and government agencies would do is to ensure that public funds would be utilized properly.
“The President has always emphasized that while we are expediting the rollout of vaccines, we must always exercise due diligence and consider the best interests of our people. Especially in times of crisis, every single peso counts,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

CEBU CITY – A returning Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) tested positive for COVID-19 even after completing two doses of the vaccine manufactured by Sinopharm of China.
The OFW came from the United Arab Emirates and arrived in Mandaue City last Jan. 5.
Department of Health Central Visayas (DOH 7) spokesperson Dr. Mary Jean Loreche said the male OFW was jabbed with the Sinopharm vaccine twice – the first last Dec. 12 and the second on Jan. 2.The OFW completed the required quarantine period last Jan. 20 and was swabbed again last Feb. 8 and was found to be COVID-19.
“Five out of seven household members were positive for COVID-19, they are all currently isolated,” Loreche said Thursday.
Loreche said there are several reasons why the OFW was still infected despite completing two doses of the Sinopharm vaccine.
“There are no solid scientific studies yet as to the length of immunity that a vaccine can give,” said Loreche.
Loreche said it was highly probable that the immunity that the vaccine has given as a protection has yet to take effect.It was also possible that what was detected during the test was a different variant of COVID-19, she added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., made the announcement in a Palace press briefing after LGUs appealed to President Duterte to issue an order to enable them to meet the requirement of certain pharmaceutical firms like AstraZeneca for a 20-percent down payment on COVID-19 vaccines.
In his Thursday presser, presidential spokesman Harry Roque said that the signing of the memorandum allows LGUs to make advance payments of up to 50 percent of the total contract amount so they can procure COVID-19 vaccines.Based on the MO shared by Galvez during the press briefing, the said grant of authority is effective until the lifting of the State of Calamity due to COVID-19.
The memorandum authorizes the National Task Force (NTF) against COVID-19 and the Department of Health (DOH) to make advance payments exceeding 15 percent of the total contract amount for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.
The LGUs may also make advance payments exceeding the 15-percent limit as long as they are authorized by the NTF chief implementer, and subject to criteria and limits that he may establish with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
“In the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, government agencies and LGUs concerned shall ensure that any arrangements to be entered into shall be in the best interests of the government and the public,” the MO read.“All advance payments to be made pursuant to this Order shall be subject to procurement law, auditing rules and regulations, and other pertinent issuances,” it furthered.
In September last year, President Duterte slammed western pharmaceutical companies for seeking advance payments for COVID-19 vaccines, saying they are just looking for someone who will finance their research and development activities.
However in November last year, President Duterte finally allowed the government to make advance payments after realizing that the Philippines might be left behind because other countries were already scrambling to get the shots. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Aside from Go and Angara among the principal-authors, 15 more senators have co-authored Senate Bill (SB) 2057 or the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Bill.
Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health,has co-sponsored SB 2057 designed to hasten the procurement of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines.The measure allows local government units (LGUs) to procure vaccines and make advance payments, and to include an indemnification fund requested by vaccine manufacturers to cover the possible expenses and claims arising from adverse effects of the vaccines.
AccordingAngara, the principal sponsor of the measure to hasten the process of procurement and administration of the COVID-19 vaccines, the measure gives authority to the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 to “undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport, and distribution.”
If required by the supplier, manufacturer, distributor, contractor or consultant, the bill also allows LGUs procuring their own vaccines to pay in advance not more than 50 percent of the contract price.The said measure was also co-authored by Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph G. Recto, Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri, and Senators Imee R. Marcos, Grace Poe, Pia S. Cayetano, Ramon ‘’Bong’’ Revilla Jr., Francis Tolentino, Sherwin Gatchalian, Nancy Binay, Cynthia A. Villar, Risa Hontiveros, Francis Pangilinan, Emmanuel ‘’Manny’’ Pacquiao, Joel Villanueva and Richard J. Gordon.“In the spirit of bayanihan, some LGUs have entered into tripartite agreements with the national government and vaccine manufacturers and have allotted funds to help ensure the immediate and efficient roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccination program. Malaking tulong po ito. Sa kabila nito, marami pa tayong mga oportunidad upang magtulungan (This is a big help. Aside from this, there are more opportunities for us to work together), ”Go said.SB 2057 also proposes the creation of a COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund. It will be administered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and will be sourced from the 2021 national budget’s Contingent Fund.
“The Vaccine Indemnification Fund is intended to be earmarked exclusively to compensate and indemnify identified vaccine recipients who sustain injury in connection with the use of the vaccines and where the adverse effects may be attributed to the vaccination,” Go explained.He added that, according to vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., all vaccine manufacturers require indemnity and liability frameworks, which include setting up an indemnification fund backed by legislation to safeguard them from possible liabilities.
Go also emphasized and commended the inclusion of a provision in the Committee Report that would waive the requirement of Phase 4 trials for COVID-19 medication and vaccine stipulated in the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law to expedite the procurement of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The provision under Bayanihan 2 is due to expire next month which is why this provision is needed to cover the ongoing procurement of vaccines,” Go explained.
The Health Technology Assessment Council will now have the authority to make recommendations to the DOH and the PhilHealth on COVID-19 vaccines based on preliminary data from Phase 3 clinical trials and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations.
“I just want to underscore that to ensure safety, there must be an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration,” Go suggested. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Amid persistent reports that fake vaccines for Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) are being sold and and are being administered in some parts of the country, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) ordered the Philippine National Police (PNP) on Thursday, Feb 18, to exercise extra vigilance to arrest groups selling or administering fake doses for the virus.

The order came after Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto posted on Twitter a picture of supposedly fake Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines and warned the public not to purchase them. There were also reports that fake COVID-19 vaccines are being circulated in the market as the demand for vaccination increases.
DILG officer-in-charge (OIC) Bernardo C. Florece, Jr. pointed out that errant groups have taken advantage of the pandemic and are now engaged in transactions involving fake COVID-19 vaccines.“I am directing the PNP to arrest these criminals and ensure that these bogus vaccines are taken off the market,” Florece said.
He insisted the PNP must work double time in “making certain that no bogus coronavirus vaccines are sold to unsuspecting people.’’ Florece noted that all possible areas such as air and sea ports where illegal supplies of fake coronavirus vaccines may enter the country must be properly and strictly monitored by the PNP Aviation Security Group and Maritime Group, among others.

Senators on Thursday lamented how the Philippines is still scrambling to secure COVID-19 vaccine supplies and is lagging behind several countries in its vaccination plans.

Senator Nancy Binay said she is disappointed that at this point the only thing that is certain is that the Philippines still has to wait for vaccines supplies to arrive in its ports, despite the series of dry runs the government task force for COVID-19 has already done.
“Parang at this point, ang sigurado lang ay hindi sigurado kung kelan dadating yung bakuna (at this point, it seems what is certain is that it is uncertain when the vaccines will arrive),” Binay said in an interview over ANC’s Headstart.On the other hand, she said, Congress has been doing its best to respond to the request of the government’s task force in order to expedite the roll out of the vaccination program.
“I think we’ve proven within ourselves na kapag may hiniling ang (that whenever there is a request from the) executive department, we deliver.
“You can see that when we passed Bayanihan 1 and 2, yung FIST—anything that would help us recover from this pandemic. Mabilis pa kami sa alas-singko na magta-trabaho (we go to work immediately),” she said of the two COVID-related laws and the Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer Act which provides insulation against shocks to the Philippine banking sector.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, during the Senate’s session on Wednesday, also expressed fears, pointed out many are still baffled by the country’s current situation as countries like Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar have already started rolling out COVID-19 jabs.“Bakit tayo hanggang ngayon, wala pa rin? (Why is it that until now we still have nothing?)” Drilon pointed out.
“Each day we fail to start the vaccination raises the risk of further spread of the virus and makes our economic recovery longer,” he lamented.
Drilon noted the government has not signed any supply agreement for COVID-19 vaccines. This, he said, would pose as a great risk apart from Filipinos’ lack of confidence in the vaccines themselves.
 Sen. Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara on Wednesday said supply agreements for the Philippines’ procurement of COVID-19 vaccines may be signed by the end of February.
Angara made the remark when he defended Senate Bill No. 2057 that seeks to expedite the purchase and administration of the vaccines and establishing a P500-million indemnification fund.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. had earlier said the government is still finalizing the supply agreement with manufacturers Sinovac, Novavax and Moderna. Galvez has been prodding Congress to pass an indemnification law, which he said is required by the COVAX facility.

– On the marketPFIZER/BIONTECH
The mRNA vaccine developed by US pharma giant Pfizer and German start-up BioNTech is already approved for use in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Britain and several other nations.Clinical trials showed the vaccine, which delivers instructions to the body to help the immune system identify and destroy COVID-19 molecules, is more than 95 percent effective.
MODERNA
Another mRNA vaccine, with a 94.1-percent efficacy rate, has been approved for use in the EU, North America, Britain, and several other nations, including Israel and Singapore.
ASTRAZENECA/OXFORDThis viral vector vaccine is authorised for use in the EU, Britain and other countries such as India.
It was shown to be 60 percent effective in trials, but a relative lack of safety and efficacy data among older participants has led several countries to recommend against administering the vaccine to those over 65.
SPUTNIK VRussia’s vaccine works in a similar way to the AstraZeneca/Oxford jab, but has a 91.6-percent efficacy according to trial results.
More than a dozen nations have authorised its use, including Belarus, Armenia, Iran, Algeria, Argentina, South Korea and Venezuela.
Its makers have begun the process of asking for approval from the European Medicines Agency. Hungary is the sole EU member state that has started administering doses.
SINOPHARM
Two vaccines developed in China use the traditional technique of injecting the deactivated virus in order to trigger an immune response.As well as the United Arab Emirates, Hungary, Cambodia, Peru and Zimbabwe have all started administering the vaccine, which its makers say is 79 percent effective.
SINOVAC
The other Chinese-developed vaccine uses a similar technique and is authorised for use in China, Chile, Brazil and Turkey.
Others such as Ukraine and Uruguay have pre-ordered doses.Its makers say it is 50 percent effective against COVID-19 (and 80 percent effective against severe illness), but trial results have not yet been made public.
JOHNSON & JOHNSON
The US pharma giant has asked for emergency use authorisation for its single-shot vaccine in the US and EU.
South Africa became the first country to begin administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after saying it would prioritise its procurement over the AstraZeneca jab.Trials showed it to be 66 percent effective against COVID-19 and up to 85 percent effective against serious forms of infection.
BHARAT BIOTECH
This inactivated virus vaccine is used currently in India.
CANSINO
A Chinese-made viral vector vaccine was authorised for use in Mexico last week, but has not yet been administered to the public.
– Authorisation pending
NOVAVAX
This American vaccine is under rolling review by the EMA, which has the ultimate say on EU medical authorisations.
It is based on “sub-unit” proteins that trigger an immune response without delivering the whole virus.Its makers say it is 89.3 percent effective.CUREVAC
The German vaccine entered EMA review last week. It uses similar technology to the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech jabs.
– Still in development
The World Health Organization says there are currently 69 vaccines against the novel coronavirus in human trials.An additional 180 candidate vaccines are under development, but have yet to begin testing on humans. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The United Nations on Wednesday led calls for a coordinated global effort to vaccinate against COVID-19, warning that gaping inequities in initial efforts put the whole planet at risk.
A health worker waits to administer the Johnson and Johnson vaccine at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa
Foreign ministers met virtually for a first-ever UN Security Council session on vaccinations called by current chair Britain, which said the world had a “moral duty” to act together against the pandemic that has killed more than 2.4 million people.
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced alarm that just 10 nations have administered 75 percent of doses so far — and 130 countries have had none at all.“The world urgently needs a global vaccination plan to bring together all those with the required power, scientific expertise and production and financial capacities,” Guterres said.
He said the Group of 20 major economies was in the best position to set up a task force on financing and implementation of global vaccinations and offered full support of the United Nations.
“If the virus is allowed to spread like wildfire in the Global South, it will mutate again and again. New variants could become more transmissible, more deadly and, potentially, threaten the effectiveness of current vaccines and diagnostics,” Guterres said.
“This can prolong the pandemic significantly, enabling the virus to come back to plague the Global North.”Henrietta Fore, head of the UN children’s agency UNICEF, said: “The only way out of this pandemic for any of us is to ensure vaccinations are available for all of us.”
– Gaps in efforts –
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard denounced the “injustice” of what he called a “deepening gap” as wealthy countries “monopolize the vaccines.”
There is already a plan to help developing nations — Covax is an initiative funded by donors and governments that aims to procure two billion vaccine doses in 2021 with options for a further billion.Covax will soon be able to start delivery of vaccines after the World Health Organization approved the shot developed by AstraZeneca, on which the initiative is almost entirely reliant in its first wave.
But aid groups say that many people still risk being left out due to a shortfall in Covax funding to arrange the administration and delicate transportation of vaccines as well as conflicts that make inoculation efforts impossible.
Britain, one of the largest contributors to Covax with a commitment of £548 million ($760 million), reiterated a UN call for temporary ceasefires to allow vaccinations, estimating that more than 160 million people were at risk in conflict zones.
“We have a moral duty to act, and a strategic necessity to come together to defeat this virus,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.
In his first Security Council appearance, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed that President Joe Biden’s administration would take a leadership role after reversing Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the World Health Organization.Blinken said the United States would pay up its more than $200 million in obligations to the UN body by the end of the month and make a “significant” contribution to Covax.
“The United States will work as a partner to address global challenges,” Blinken said.
– Pressure on China –
But Blinken vowed to press for improvements in the WHO, which Trump, under fire for his own handling of the pandemic, accused of being beholden to China and not stopping the deadly virus.
“All countries must make available all data from the earliest days of any outbreak,” Blinken said, in a veiled renewal of US criticism that China has not cooperated with a WHO probe into how the virus first emerged in 2019 in Wuhan.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned in his remarks against “attempts to politicize the pandemic” and renewed Beijing’s offer of 10 million doses of its homegrown vaccine to Covax.
“We should come together to reject vaccine nationalism,” he said.
One immediate question for the United Nations is whether its own peacekeepers should have priority in vaccination.
India, a leading exporter of vaccines, announced a donation of 200,000 doses for UN peacekeepers.
“The pharmacy of the world is stepping forward to meet the global vaccines challenge,” Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said.
One discordant voice at the Security Council was Russia, which has been promoting its own vaccine and only put forward its UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, to the UN session.
He said that vaccinations were a matter “for specialized UN agencies” and “exceed the jurisdiction of the Security Council.”SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementor and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. disclosed this to senators Wednesday during the plenary discussion on the bill that would expedite the procurement of coronavirus vaccines.
“Wala pa ho daw (There is none yet),” said Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, the bill’s sponsor, as he quoted Galvez who was present in the Senate, along with Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, to aid in the interpellations.Angara said he was told, on the other hand, that local governments have already signed “a number of contracts”, even as they have not yet issued down payments for the vaccine supply.
As for the private sector, the senator was informed the private firms have perfected contracts and already made 50-percent down payment for six million doses of the vaccine.
Galvez, however, pointed out that the procurements of the LGUs and the private sector were done through tripartite agreements involving the national government.“So ang private sector may perfected contract, may downpayment; ang local government may perfected contract pero wala pang downpayment. Ang national government walang perfected contract, walang downpayment (So the private sector already has a perfected contract and downpayment; while local governments have perfected contracts but no downpayment. But the national government has no perfected contract or downpayments yet)?” Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said.“Tama po, ang pinakasigurista po ‘yong national government ho (Yes, the national government was the most perfectionist of them all),” Angara confirmed.
Galvez earlier blamed the delay in the delivery of the Pfizer vaccines to the country on the lack of an indemnification law that would ensure compensation in case of adverse reactions to their products.
He said the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility, from the which the Pfizer vaccines will be acquired, requires governments to have an indemnity mechanism.But Recto observed that an indemnification law may “not be necessary” since LGUs and private firms managed to perfect contracts and make down payments prior the passage of such law.
“I’m just trying to wonder why we have not been able to sign any contract, the national government?…And I don’t see anything here in this bill that would hasten the procurement by the national government,” he said.
The government is looking to implement the vaccination program within the first quarter of this year, with 50 to 70 million Filipinos targeted to be given the COVID-19 vaccines.
During the plenary debates, Angara, still quoting Galvez, said the government expects to sign a “few” supply agreements with vaccine makers by the end of February. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The British Embassy in Manila on Wednesday announced the launching of the United Kingdom-Philippines Vaccine Clinic to help in the safe delivery of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine in the Philippines.
British Ambassador Daniel Pruce
Together with the University of the Philippines – College of Public Health, the knowledge-exchange clinic pools technical resources between the UK and the Philippines to share learning on safely delivering the vaccine.
British Ambassador Daniel Pruce said the clinic echoes the Philippine government’s ‘one of society’ approach in tackling COVID-19 and demonstrates the Filipino value of ‘walang iwanan’ (nobody is left behind).“It is only by working together that we can end this global pandemic. And the UK, through the British Embassy in Manila, remains committed to supporting Filipinos access to vaccines, developed under transparent mechanisms and delivered safely and effectively,” Pruce said during the inaugural session on February 10, 2021.The UK Prosperity Fund-backed series will convene technical, scientific, and policy experts from the UK Vaccine Task Force, the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies, Health Education England and the National Health Service in sessions covering the following: deployment and procurement strategies; community-based vaccine delivery and administration; and tackling vaccine hesitancy.Earlier, the British government has allocated £548m to the United Nations-led COVAX Advance Market Commitment, which is aiming to distribute 1 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year.Early this month, the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) designated the Philippines as among the first countries that could receive an indicative distribution of up to 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines; mostly of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed in the United Kingdom through the COVAX Global Vaccines Facility. It is expected that the vaccine will start being available for delivery from the first quarter of 2021.National Task Force (NTF) chief Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., thanked the British government for its support in helping the vaccination of about 9 million Filipinos in the first half of 2021League of Cities Vaccine Procurement Committee Chair and Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas encouraged local governments to participate in the learning exchange webinars which he said will be of great help for local governments to inform strategies in administering vaccines through local health systems.

• The Philippine Society of Alergy, Asthma and Immunology said that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh the potential risks of adverse reactions.
• There are two kinds of possible reactions: Reactogenic and allergic reaction.• Examples of reactogenic reactions include pain and swelling in the injection site that occurs within the first three days.
• An allergy or hypersensitivity reaction is an exaggerate immune response to a usually harmless substance.
• People with allergy to food such as egg; allergy to inhalant allergens (such as) dust mites, pollens, pets; to insects; those with eczema, those patients with controlled asthma whether they are inhalers or not; those patients with allergic rhinitis whether they are on nasal sprays or not; patients with history of urticaria; patients who have history of rashes to oral medications can receive the vaccine.

While people are waiting for the arrival of the vaccines against COVID-19, many stories about the vaccine – from the experiences of those who have already been given the second jab, to questions on who can be given the vaccines are crowding digital media.The Philippine Society of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (PSAAI) on Feb. 11 conducted a virtual forum titled “Allergies and COVID–19 Vaccines: A Heart to Heart Talk” to clarify the issues that are related to allergies.
Themain speakers were PSAAI President Dr. Rommel Crisenio M. Lobo and Dr. Maria Carmen D. Ang, a PSAAI member.
In the forum, Dr. Ang assured the public that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh the potential risks of adverse reactions. “Based on current data, the benefits of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risk of an allergic reaction,” she said.Here are some of the issues related to allergies which were discussed by PSAAI doctors during the webinar:
Reactogenic reaction and allergic reaction
According to Dr. Ang, reactions to COVID-19 vaccine may occur, but not all reactions are allergic.
“Majority of the reactions are reactogenic. This means that since the vaccines stimulate the immune system, they may cause side effects. Reactogenic reactions are not the same as allergic reactions,” she said during the media forum.

The official statement of PSAAI posted on their website explained: “A reactogenic reaction is an inflammatory, response that occurs after vaccination.”
In the forum , Dr. Ang said: “Examples of reactogenic reactions include pain and swelling in the injection site that occurs within the first three days. It can be systemic like headache, muscle pain, fever and chills, vomiting, tiredness, and body aches.”Dr. Ang said that those reactions are usually gone within one to three days and can be managed withparacetamol, pain relievers, hydration, or cold compress.
Anaphylaxis
On the other hand, “allergy is an exaggerated immune response to a usually harmless substance,” said Dr. Ang. Anaphylaxis is a type of severe allergic reaction.
The PSAAI statement in its website explained: “Anaphylaxis, which is a severe type I reaction, is rare with an estimated incidence of 11.1 per 1million doses of mRN COVID-19 vaccines. The incidence of anaphylaxis to other covid-19 vaccines is currently unknown.”

In the forum, Dr. Ang explained: “Patients who develop anaphylaxis can have two or more organs involved and these may result in developing symptoms such as rashes or hives, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, vomiting, swelling of the face, low blood pressure, fast heart beat.” Anaphylaxis usually happens within the first 15 to 30 minutes after injection.
However, Ang said that “severe allergic reactions are rare.” She said that “mild allergic reactions are managed with antihistamines. Anaphylaxis is rare and (this is) managed with epinephrine.”
Dr. Ang and Dr. Lobo said that they have not heard of deaths due to anaphylaxis that can be linked to COVID-19 vaccines.
People with allergies
Ang said that people with allergy to food, inhalant allergens, among others, can take the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Patients with allergy to food such as egg; allergy to inhalant allergens (such as) dust mites, pollens, pets; to insects; those with eczema, those patients with controlled asthma whether they are inhalers or not; those patients with allergic rhinitis whether they are on nasal sprays or not; patients with history of urticaria; patients who have history of rashes to oral medications can receive the vaccine,” she said.
Allergic reaction to other vaccines
Meanwhile, patients who had “an immediate allergic reaction to other vaccines other than the COVID-19 vaccines and other injectable medications, need further evaluation by an allergist/ immunologist if they can receive the COVID-19 vaccine or not,” said Ang.This file photo taken on January 08, 2021 shows empty bottles of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine at the Emile Muller hospital in Mulhouse, eastern France.

“If they are cleared for vaccination, they should be observed for at least 30 minutes,” she said.Who should not receive the second dose of COVID-19 vaccines?
The patients who had mild or severe allergic reactions to the first dose are advised not receive the second dose, said Dr. Ang.
“Patients with immediate allergic reaction whether mild to severe, such as anaphylaxis, after the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine should not receive the second dose,” said Ang.

“Those patients with a history of allergic reactions to any component of the COVID-19 vaccine, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate should not receive the vaccine as well. These patients should be referred to an allergist or immunologist for further evaluation,” she added.
Those who experienced reactogenic reactions
PSAAI President Dr. Rommel Lobo said that those who experience reactogenic reactions (injection site pain, among others) should take the second dose of COVID-19 vaccines.
Vaccination sites ready for patients with allergic reactions
The PSAAI said that healthcare workers who will be manning the vaccination sites are trained to manage allergic reactions. Vaccine recipients will be first screened by the health workers before the vaccine will be injected to them.
“Yes, they are trained in recognizing and giving the first intervention which is your epinephrine. Firstly, you will not be vaccinated right away. In the vaccination site, the doctors and nurses there have a checklist to screen vaccinee if they are fit to be vaccinated,” said Dr. Lobo.
“Epinephrine will be made available in the vaccination centers.Patients who undergo vaccination will be observed for 30 minutes. If during the 30 minutes, the doctor there would say that the patient is having anaphylaxis, then epinephrine will be injected and the patient will be brought to the nearest (hospital) ER (emergency room),” said Dr. Maria Carmela Kasala, a member of PSAAI.

Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri on Wednesday assured the swift passage of the bill that would speed up the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines and ensure compensation for those who will experience adverse effects after their immunization.
Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel “Migz” F. Zubiri (Alexis Nueva España/Senate PRIB)
Zubiri said the Upper Chamber will be prioritizing Senate Bill No. 2057, or the proposed “COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021”, saying he scheduled plenary discussions on the bill for their Wednesday session.
” We scheduled it first hour this afternoon, matatapos po namin ito, mamayang hapon (we can finish it this afternoon). We commit that,” the Senate official said on the government’s daily Laging Handa public briefing, February 17.Should President Duterte certify the measure as urgent, as Cabinet members had appealed, Zubiri said the Senate could pass the bill on final reading immediately.
“Kung ma-certify po siya as urgent ng Malacañang,pwede po natin ma-second and third reading ngayong hapon (If Malacañang certifies this as urgent, we can pass it on second and third reading also this afternoon),” he said.
“Kung meron pong kaibahan ang Senate and House version baka mag-bicam itong weekend na ito (if there are differences in the Senate and House of Representatives’ versions, we can have the bicameral this weekend). Hopefully, we can ratify this by Monday next week,” he further said.
” Hopefully, before the end of the month, maging batas na ito, kung pirmahan agad ng Presidente (this will become a law, if the President signs it immediately),” he continued.On Tuesday, February 16, Senate finance committee chair Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara sponsored SB No. 2057, which proposes to allow local government units (LGUs) to procure COVID-19 vaccine and services for their storage, transport and distribution. The bill also allows LGUs to make advanced payments to vaccine makers to secure supplies.
But LGUs would only be allowed to purchase vaccine supplies of up to 50 percent of their target population, with priority given to frontline health workers senior citizens and indigent persons.
The purchase must also be still be done in coordination with the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force (NTF) against COVID-19.Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said these provisions would ensure that LGUs will not go on a “shopping spree” of COVID-19 vaccines and that “vaccine equitability will be honored.”
The bill also provides a P500-million indemnity fund in case of death or severe adverse effects following the immunization. The appropriation, sourced from the contingent fund under the 2021 General Appropriations Act, would be administered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.
The bill also seeks to grant public officers, employees, contractors or volunteers immunity from liability over claims related to the administration of the vaccines. The DOH would be tasked to provide the guidelines and identify the persons to be covered by this provision. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In a virtual press briefing, Dizon said the national government and local government units have trained enough vaccinators and are ready to vaccinate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos in 2021.
“Tutulong din po sa atin ang iba’t ibang NGO (non-government organizations) tulad ng Philippine Red Cross at private sectors (Various NGOs such as the Philippine Red Cross and private sectors will also help us),” Dizon said during Laging Handa briefing.“Tayo po ay kampante at ready na po tayo pagdating po ng mga bakuna unang-una dahil sa COVAX facility ay magsisimula na po immediately ang ating program (We are confident and ready to start our vaccination program as soon as the vaccines from the COVAX facility arrive here),” he added.
The testing czar also said the indemnification law is standard to all vaccine manufacturers, not only in Pfizer.
“Yan po ay standard at lahat po ng vaccine manufacturer ay nangangailangan nito dahil itong mga bakunang ito hindi pa natatapos ang product registration sa buong mundo (That is standard to all vaccine manufacturers, it is needed because these vaccines have not yet completed product registration worldwide),” Dizon said.
“Sila po ay undergoing trials pa, most of them Phase 3 trials pa. Pero kailangan na natin silang gamitin dahil emergency situation na ang COVID-19 sa buong mundo. Wala pong pagkakaiba ang mga indemnification process (Vaccines are still undergoing trials, most of them are still in the Phase 3. But we need to use them because there’s an global emergency situation because of COVID-19. There’s not difference in the indemnification process),” he clarified.The Philippines’ lack of an indemnification law, which ensures compensation for COVID-19 vaccine recipients who sustain injury or any adverse effects from the jab— has delayed the arrival of 117,000 doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines.
In an interview with ANC last week, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the arrival of Pfizer COVID-19 shots could have been delivered to the country mid February if the Philippines had its own indemnification law. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Bureau of Customs (BOC) says locally-made fake vaccines for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could become a public health threat if enterprising syndicates follow through with alleged plans to manufacture them.
(Daniel Schludi / UNSPLASH / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“BOC warns the public to be careful when availing of vaccines, as fake vaccines may have severe health consequences to users,” the agency said in a statement Wednesday, Feb. 17.
“The composition of such vaccines are not tested and even worst (sic) fake vaccines may not be effective thus further exposing users to the dangers of COVID-19,” it added.The BOC gave the warning even as the Philippines is expected to receive it supply of the sought-after vaccines from abroad anytime this month, if not this week.
“Early in the year, the Bureau released its initial advisory as the result of an article published by the International Police (INTERPOL). In the article it was identified that syndicates and other underground groups have acknowledged the value that vaccines have and are currently engaged on how to get a piece of the pie through the manufacture and distribution of fake vaccines,” it said.
The BOC, in partnership with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), and Food and Drug Agency (FDA), had previously discovered makeshift clinics that were suspected to have been used to treat COVID-19 patients.
Customs said such clinics “may be utilized as an avenue of distribution for local fake vaccines.”The agency had earlier tightened security at the country’s ports, particularly against the importation of fake and smuggled medicines and vaccines.

The Senate Committee on Finance has endorsed for plenary approval the measure seeking to expedite the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines in the country.
Sen. Sonny Angara (Henzberg Austria / Senate PRIB)
Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, chair of the Senate finance panel, said approval of Senate Bill No. 2057 or the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 is necessary to help the country realize its goal to be COVID-free this year, 2021.
“We, as a people, have lost so much because of the pandemic—in terms of jobs, opportunities and human life. However, we believe that with this measure, we have not lost out on the belief that there will in fact be an end to this ordeal,” Angara said in his sponsorship speech.The bill, a consolidation of other COVID-19 related bills filed by senators, primarily aims to expedite procurement of the vaccines by authorizing the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport and distribution.
The measure also allows local government units (LGUs), namely provinces, cities and municipalities to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services but only in cooperation with the DOH and the NTF.
The bill also allows LGUs to make advance payments for the purchase of the vaccines and supplies but only for up to 50 percent of their target population. It also mandates LGUs to give due priority to frontline health workers, senior citizens, and indigent persons as recipients of the vaccines.
Under the bill, LGUs will also be allowed to use whatever resources they have to purchase vaccines and supplies, on top of the P82.5-billion that has been appropriated in 2021 for the government’s national immunization program against COVID-19.The bill also allows private entities to purchase vaccines subject to similar restrictions and conditions set for LGUs. It also exempts COVID-19 vaccines and supplies from customs duties, value added tax (VAT), excise tax, donor’s tax and other fees and charges levied on the purchased vaccines.
The measure also establishes a COVID-19 National Indemnification Fund—as proposed by the Department of Finance—in order to compensate any inoculated person that would subsequently suffer serious adverse side effects or SAEs after being vaccinated.
The bill also seeks a Vaccination Passport Program, in compliance with data privacy laws. These passports will contain only relevant information such as basic personal information, manufacturer of the vaccine used, date of inoculation, etc.The measure, Angara said, also authorizes the Health Technology Assessment Council or HTAC to make recommendations to the DOH and PhilHealth about COVID-19 vaccines based on preliminary Phase 3 clinical trials, but only if the relevant vaccine manufacturer has been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“Through the aforementioned steps, we hope to break down some regulatory barriers, free up some resources, and empower as many government instrumentalities as we can towards the fast procurement and expeditious roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccinations,” Angara stressed. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Joel Villanueva on Tuesday co-sponsored the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 allowing local government units (LGUs) and private entities to purchase vaccines in cooperation with the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19.
Sen. Joel Villanueva (Henzberg Austria/Senate PRIB)Villanueva, chairman of the Senate labor committee, said not all LGUs and private companies have the resources and capability to procure the vaccines but ’we also know that there can be an ‘equity issue’ along the way.
‘’While it is true that richer LGUs with the capacity to pay like Metro Manila cities would be the first to purchase vaccines, we should also remember that Metro Manila is a pandemic hotspot that accounts for about half of our country’s total Covid-19 cases in our country,’’ he pointed out.Villanueva said that as he spoke, more than 176 million shots have already been administered across 78 countries.
‘’The latest estimate was at a rate of 5.99 million doses a day, but not a single shot has reached our shores,’’ he said.
Other senators pointed out that not one COVID-19 dose of vaccine has reached the Philippines. But once this measure is passed so that once the vaccines are here, they could easily reach the arms of every Filipino adult who wanted one, Villanueva said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

This, as the Administrative Support for COVID-19 Task Force (ASCOTF) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) has stepped up its information drive to convince all its personnel to avail of the government’s vaccination against the coronavirus infection.
Lt. Gen. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, Deputy Chief for Administration and concurrent PNP-ASCOTF commander, said the aggressive information drive is being done through an application exclusive for all the PNP personnel.Through PNP CODA (COVID-19 Data), Eleazar said videos and fact sheets from the Department of Health and other scientists about the benefits of vaccination are regularly posted to educate both the uniformed and civilian personnel on how the vaccine works and its benefits amid the continuous threat of infection from the deadly virus.
“Some of our personnel are really hesitant to avail of the COVID-19 vaccine and we attribute it to the deluge of information that they would read or see especially in the social media. But as our health experts always say, vaccination far outweighs the potential risks and claims of danger,” said Eleazar.
“So what we do now is to persuade them or convince them to be vaccinated. But we would like to clarify that we are not forcing them, we are just trying to explain everything to them,” he added.
Last week, the PNP Health Service initiated a survey among PNP personnel to identify who among them want to be vaccinated. Policemen, especially those assigned in the COVID-19 response frontlines and those whose assignments are related to contain the pandemic, are in the government’s priority list.Based on the initial result, almost half of the policemen surveyed did not want to be vaccinated.
While the respondents were only asked if they want to be vaccinated, Eleazar said those who said no gave an explanation as to why they are refusing the free COVID-19 vaccination offer of the government.
He said most of the respondents who said no stated that they want to have more information about the vaccination while some responded that they need more time to decide.“That is their honest to goodness perception about the vaccines. And that also serves as the basis of our intervention. So our Health Service came up with DOH vaccination videos for the appreciation of our personnel,” said Eleazar.
As a result of the information drive, Eleazar said that thousands of policemen changed their mind and signified interest in being vaccinated.
“From 49 percent when we first conducted the survey, the percentage of those who do not want to be vaccinated is now only at 37 percent. Based on our data, this translates to a change of mind of more than 26,000 of our personnel,” he said.
Eleazar said they expect more policemen to avail of the COVID-19 vaccines as the PNP has expanded the information dissemination on the vaccination using other platforms such as direct talks with PNP personnel. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

BACOLOD CITY – The League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) is appealing to the Office of President Rodrigo Duterte to issue an Executive Order to authorize city mayors to make advance payments for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines contracted by city governments.
This was stated in Resolution No. 2021-01 adopted by LCP during its Special General Assembly on February 4.
Pursuant to Presidential Decree 1445, local government units need an express authorization and issuance from President Duterte such as an Executive Order allowing them to procure vaccines and proceed with the required advance payment market provision in their respective agreements with the pharmaceutical companies.
Thus, the LCP members are seeking the urgent action of the Office of the President to issue the necessary Executive Order at the soonest possible time.
LCP national president and Bacolod Mayor Evelio Leonardia said they need the intervention of the President to pursue the availment of the vaccines.“With his authority to allow advance payment, our local vaccination program can be set in accelerated motion,” Leonardia said.
The LCP, during its Special General Assembly on January 12, which was attended by 114 city mayors, agreed to partner with the national government in implementing the COVID-19 vaccination program.
The League took initiatives in encouraging cities to procure their vaccines to ensure that the target population is vaccinated.
As a result of this initiative and in coordination with the National Task Force on COVID-19, several cities have already entered into tripartite agreements with AstraZeneca pharmaceutical company under the “A Dose of Hope” program on January 14.
For Bacolod City alone, the city government is planning to procure 650,000 doses of AstraZeneca amounting to P300 million for its residents. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City said preparations for its vaccination rollout has been smooth.
Dr. Norberto Francisco, spokesman of the Lung Center of the Philippines, said hospital staff have been practicing the vaccination process daily, whether as a “whole or each individual segment.”“Kasi nga, maselan ito at saka surgical precision ang kilos ng mga tao kaya bawat munting hakbang talagang may nakatutok, may nakabantay, may nag mo-monitor, may nag a-audit, may mga nag ta-time (The entire process must be carefully done, people need to move with surgical precision that’s why there’s a person stationed in every step to monitor, to audit, to time the process),” Francisco said in an interview with DZMM Teleradyo on Tuesday, Feb. 16.
“Practice makes perfect,” he added.
Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital (Tala Hospital) in Caloocan, for its part, said it had so far conducted four simulation exercises for its vaccination rollout.
The hospital’s medical center chief, Dr. Alfonso Victorino Famaran, said the entire vaccination process will take about 53 minutes per person from entrance to exit.The 53 minutes already includes the 30-minute observation period, according to Famaran.
Both hospitals are also stepping up their information campaign on vaccines to convince their remaining personnel who still have reservations about the COVID-19 vaccine.
The Lung Center of the Philippines has about 83 to 90 percent vaccination acceptance among its employees, according to Francisco.Tala Hospital has 90 percent vaccination acceptance, Famaran said.
“Pinupuntahan po namin yung mga empleyado na nagsasabing ‘ayaw namin’ at ‘hindi ho kami sigurado’ sa mga opisina nila at doon kami nag le-lecture tungkol po dito para mahikayat po sila na magpabakuna (We went to the offices of those who said ‘I don’t want to be vaccinated’ and ‘I’m not sure,’ and gave them a lecture about the vaccines to encourage them to get vaccinated),” Famaran told DZMM Teleradyo.
Francisco said the Lung Center of the Philippines has conducted fora and hospital-wide information campaigns and has talked personally to employees who have yet to decide whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine or not.
“Education is the best means for us to convince them,” Francisco said.
He encouraged employees to get vaccinated, saying that it is a “chance of a lifetime.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In the President Duterte’s pre-recorded briefing, Galvez cited the need for Congress and Senate to certify as urgent the indemnification measure, a requirement by many western producers of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the bill that will allow local government units to make advance payments for their own supply of the vaccines.Although the country has already complied with the documentation on COVAX vaccines, Galvez said that “the ball is with WHO (World Health Organization) and Congress.”“Kung magkasundo na po sa indemnification agreement, wala na po tayong hadlang kasi mayroon na po tayong preparation. Okay na po ang preparation natin. May EUA na po tayo sa Pfizer for the COVAX ano po, COVAX donation, at nakapag-comply na rin po tayo sa mga documentation po na hinihingi po ng WHO at saka Gavi (If they will agree with the indemnification agreement, we won’t have any hurdle because we have preparation. We’re okay with our preparation. We have an EUA (emergency use authorization) for Pfizer for the COVAX facility, COVAX donation, and also complied with the documentation the WHO and Gavi are asking),” he said.
COVAX and Gavi are two facilities that ensure lower-income economies can have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.Galvez said they already talked with Senate President Tito Sotto and Senator Christoper “Bong” Go about the prioritization of the indemnification clause and the bill that will allow local government units to make advance market commitment for the purchase of the vaccines.“Kaya po mayroon po kaming communication, Mr. President, na this bill should be ano certified as urgent. Iyon po ang recommendation po namin sa last na magkaroon po ng ano ng tinatawag nating certification of urgent itong dalawang bill po na ginagawa po ng Senado at saka ng Kongreso po ngayon (That’s why we have a communication, Mr. President, that this bill should be certified as urgent. That’s our recommendation that we should have what is called certification of urgent of these two bills in the Senate and Congress now),” he said.The vaccine czar had previously said the Pfizer vaccine could have been delivered to the country last Friday if only the Philippines had its own indemnification law.
The government is still processing some documents with the assistance of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the COVAX facility.

Nurse Chareluck Santos is excited to have been given the “challenging” role of being the first COVID-19 vaccinator at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH).
(Agence France Presse / MANILA BULLETIN)
In an interview with CNN Philippines on Monday, Santos said she initially felt nervous upon learning that she will take on the role of the first vaccinator.
“I didn’t know kung magagawa ko po ba ng maayos ‘yung unang pagbabakuna (if I’ll be able to perform the vaccination well),” Santos, who serves as head nurse for the University of the Philippines (UP) Health Service, said.While she feels nervous about her role, Santos said she is also excited to administer the first COVID-19 vaccine in PGH.
“We all believe that this is a glimmer of hope for those po na naapektuhan ng COVID (who were affected by COVID),” she said.
Santos said everyone at PGH feels elated with the arrival of the vaccines, saying it is a step forward towards eliminating COVID-19.
“Sa dami po ng pinagdaanan natin, hindi lang ng healthcare workers, pati po ng mga kapwa natin Pilipino, naniniwala po kaming lahat na ang bakuna ay isang step forward or isang hakbang patungo sa pagpuksa po nitong COVID-19 o ng pandemya (With everything that we’ve been through, not just the healthcare workdes, but every Filipino, we believe that the vaccine is a step foward towards eliminating COVID-19 or the pandemic),” she said.Santos also shared that administering the vaccine will be a challenge since it’s different from the usual vaccines she has given to patients.
The head nurse said PGH will be receiving the Pfizer vaccine which has a different temperature requirement and needs to be handled with extra caution.
“May mga pagsasanay nga po kami na bawal po siyang i-shake kasi pag na shake mo po siya, kailangan itapon ‘yon o i-discard, so sayang naman po (In our training, we were told not to shake the vaccine, because once you shake it, it needs to be discarded, and that will be such a waste),” she said.Based on their training, Santos said the Pfizer vaccine needs to be “inverted slowly ten times” before and after dilution of the medicine.

President Duterte has ordered Presidential spokesman Harry Roque and Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. to hold programs at least two times a week to inform the public about the government’s vaccination program against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
President Rodrigo Roa Duterte
Duterte made the announcement after the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) reported that only three out of 10 Metro Manila residents are willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine jabs.
In his weekly public address on Feb/ 15, Duterte said that the public should know more about the vaccines and the vaccination program, noting that the people has only been hearing about it during his weekly public addresses.“It does not come to you every day so I have requested Secretary Galvez and si Secretary Roque sila ang magdala sa public information (to give the public the information),” he said.
“It should be given twice a week para you’ll be better informed of what [the] government is doing. ‘Yan siguro ang paraan diyan (I think that should do it),” he added.
The President said he was leaving it to Roque to make the arrangements for this new effort to boost the public’s confidence in the vaccine.He likewise assured the people that the government was doing its best to address the pandemic.
“We are trying our best… We are in the process of really working towards the realization of our vaccine program,” Duterte said.
On Monday, Roque said that President Duterte finally agreed to be vaccinated in public to help boost the public’s confidence in the vaccine.He added that other government officials have expressed willingness to be among the first to receive the vaccine to boost public confidence, but appealed to critics to not accuse the government of giving VIP treatment to any of them.“Gagawin lang natin ‘yan dahil nga kinakailangan mapataas natin yung kompyansa ng ating mga kababayan na magpabakuna (We are only doing this because we need to boost the public’s confidence in the vaccine),” he said.
President Duterte has expressed a preference for either the Chinese or Russian COVID-19 vaccine but neither has been given the emergency use authorization (EUA).

Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said of these recipient-hospitals, 35 are in the National Capital Region, one in Cebu, and one in Davao.
“These hospitals were given the directives they should be able to submit to us the verified list of vaccinees plus the quick substitution list (QSL),” she said in a virtual forum held on Monday, February 15.“The feedback given to us is most of our hospitals were already able to submit their complete lists. There are some hospitals yet to complete their QSL,” she added.
Vergeire noted that all the 34 hospitals “are eligible to receive the Pfizer vaccines”, one of which is the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) in Manila.
In the same forum, PGH Director Dr. Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi expressed their readiness for the arrival of the vaccines.
“As far as the people are concerned, we are all set, I think, for whatever vaccines come requiring ultra low freezer we are ready for that,” he said.
Legaspi said their pre-registration activities netted a 94-percent registration among their personnel, which is higher than the result of their initial survey, wherein only 74 percent have agreed to get immunized versus COVID-19.“It appears that there was increased confidence when it was revealed to be Pfizer vaccine.

There is nothing to worry about the country’s coronavirus vaccine supply even though the government has yet to sign a supply agreement with the manufacturers, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said Monday.

According to Nograles, the government has secured a reserve supply of COVID-19 vaccines under the term sheets initially forged with various drug manufacturers. The supply agreement, he added, may be finalized once the local drug regulators give the green light for the emergency use of the vaccines.
“What we signed is term sheets and that term sheet, according to (vaccine czar) Secretary (Carlito) Galvez, is already a commitment kumbaga so it is not something to worry about because the term sheet already commits the number of doses na magkakaroon tayo dito sa Pilipinas (that we will have in the Philippines),” Nogralse said over CNN Philippines Monday, Feb. 15.“It’s like already reserved to the Philippines based on those term sheets and then the supply agreement will come forthwith,” said Nograles, co-chair of the government’s policy-making task force in battling the pandemic.
Nograles said certain conditions must be met before any coronavirus vaccine is used in the country. The vaccines must pass the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for safety and efficacy.
“I think presumably the supply agreement will come after all of these, like the FDA approval natin. The EUA or emergency use authorization would be issued by the FDA so there are certain conditions that have to be met,” he said.
“Although nagkaroon ng term sheet with different vaccine brands, not all the vaccine brands already have an EUA,” he added.So far, two vaccine brands, namely those developed by US-based Pfizer and British drugmaker AstraZeneca, have gained emergency use approval from the FDA in the country.
Nograles said the emergency approval of the Sinovac vaccines is expected to be issued soon. Other vaccine makers like Gamaleya Research Institute and Moderna are also expected to submit their application before FDA.
“So that’s basically what happens. There’s a term sheet agreement on how many doses you need, ang na-i-order namin (we ordered) and then it passes through conditions like FDA approval ng kanilang EUA and then that’s where the ball gets running in terms of the signing of the supply agreement,” he said.“But as far as supply is concerned, na-reserve na ‘yun for the Philippines (it has been reserved for the Philippines),” he added.
Galvez recently told a Senate inquiry that the government has not yet finalized any supply agreement but has secured 108 million doses of vaccines from different manufacturers under initial pacts. Supply deals with Sinovac, Novavax and Moderna are already being finalized.
Around 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines, donated by China, are expected to arrive in the country on Feb. 23.
The government remained hopeful about the delivery of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca supplies under the World Health Organization-backed COVAX facility this month. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

This, as a survey conducted by the DILG revealed that only three in every 10 residents of Metro Manila agree to be vaccinated. The DILG has been targeting to vaccinazed 80 percent of Metro Manila residents.
“The government won’t force the public to be vaccinated but we assure them that efforts are being intensified to encourage those who doubt the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine,” said Densing.Melchor Paclibare, a retired employee of the Social Security System (SSS) who is one of the few Metro Manila residents willing to be inoculated with the vaccine, said that a massive information drive coupled with the vaccination of national and local officials and other prominent personalities in full public view’’ might be the best solution to raise public trust on COVID-19 vaccine.
“Maybe the right move is to let the elected public officials and other personalities with huge following be vaccinated (with COVID-19 vaccines) first to gain more approval (for the vaccine),’’ Paclibare said.
Densing, for his part, said the national government will base the allocation of the COVID-19 vaccines in priority areas with high infection rates like Metro Manila while taking into consideration if the locality has a cold chain storage facility.
Before being vaccinated, Densing explained that the person will be first informed on the brand of the vaccine that will be injected which the concerned party may reject.The said person will then be placed at the tail end of the line if he chooses not to be vaccinated, according to Densing.
In the event the preferred vaccine purchased by the LGU arrives, Densing said concerned persons who would refuse the first vaccine may line up for the dose offered by the said locality. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara said donated vaccines and other critical medical supplies needed to contain and mitigate novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) should be exempted from donor’s tax.
Sen. Sonny Angara (Alexis Nueva España/Senate PRIB)
In filing Senate Bill No. 2046, Angara said donations of these life-saving drugs,medical supplies and equipment needed for its administration, delivery and storage should no longer be taxed, especially since the supply of COVID-19 vaccines are becoming widely available for purchase by the government and the private sector.
“The national government, local government units (LGUs) and the private sector are all in the thick of preparations for the arrival of the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccines,” said Angara, who chairs the Senate finance committee.“Many of these vaccines will be made available to the public through the generosity of donors. We want to encourage more of these donations by exempting these from the donor’s tax,” he added.
Angara pointed out similar incentives were already granted during the implementation of Bayanihan to Heal as One Act (Bayanihan 1) and Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2) in recognition of the need to increase the supplies of goods needed by the country’s frontliners.
“Sa pamamagitan nitong panukalang pag-exempt sa donor’s tax ay masisiguro natin ang walang hadlang na pamamahagi ng mga donasyon ng bakuna at iba pang kagamitan para sa ating gobyerno pati na din sa pribadong sektor, (Through this proposed law exempting these products from donor’s tax, we can make sure there are no hindrances in the distribution of these vaccines and other supplies to our government and likewise, to the private sector),” the senator said.
Under the bill, donations of drugs, vaccines and medical supplies specifically prescribed and directly used for the treatment of COVID-19 will be exempted from the donor’s tax.Also exempted from donor’s tax are donations of capital equipment, spare parts and raw materials needed for the production of personal protective equipment components such as coveralls, gowns, surgical masks, goggles and face shields.
Donations of drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in clinical trials—including raw materials needed for the production of these drugs—would also be exempted.
The measure also exempts donations of equipment for waste management, including waste segregation, storage, collection, sorting, treatment and disposal services. Under the proposed law, the grant of donor’s tax exemptions would be in effect from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023; all of the covered donations must only be for use of government and private entities, not for commercial use and shall only be for free distribution to or use for the containment or mitigation of COVID-19.

Withthe increasing demand for reliable information on COVID-19 vaccines, International SOS has created an innovative ‘traffic light’ indicator to help businesses track when, where and how they can roll-out corporate COVID-19 vaccination programs for their employees.
As global organizations seek advice on corporate COVID-19 vaccine policies, the indicator brings together International SOS’ COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker tapping technology and containing detailed vaccine information for all countries, with regularly updated country-level distribution and program monitoring. This is complemented with bespoke strategic and industry relevant advice from International SOS’ consulting practices.
Dr Mark Parrish, Regional Medical Director at International SOS comments, “COVID-19 vaccination programs are a complex issue, particularly for global organizations. Faced with differing regulations, vaccines and roll-out plans dependent on location, it is vital to have a strategic and agile plan in place. This should be underpinned by up-to- date information, analyzed and implemented in accordance with the needs of the workforce. We want to make it as easy as possible for organizations to be able to protect their people at the earliest and in the most efficient way.”
In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) recently issued the National Policy Framework for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment and Immunization, setting in motion the country’s vaccination program. Dr Carrianne Ewe, Medical Director at International SOS Philippines shares, “As we continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and the local authority’s approach on the country vaccination, we are able to assist clients in planning their vaccination strategies and protocols for their employees prior to the availability of the vaccine in the country. Educating your workforce with reliable information on the COVID-19 vaccines, communicating its variants, benefits and establishing facts from myths, is critical when implementing a corporate vaccination program. This provides a level of assurance to the employee that there is an end in sight. This support to our clients prepares their organization once the relevant COVID vaccines become available in the Philippines, ensuring a healthy and productive workforce and a safe return to office.”
International SOS is already supporting many of its Fortune Global 500 clients with strategic health advice from its global consulting practice, including its worldwide COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker. The internationally recognized red, amber, green traffic light system, enables clients to quickly recognize where a site or office has the potential to roll out a vaccine program. The information is updated daily.
Dr Parrish added “Obviously organizations are keen to ensure that employees are protected from COVID-19 and to uphold their Duty of Care. Our clients want to know where and what vaccines are available to them for their employees, as well as where they may be asked to actively participate in vaccination programs and their responsibility to do this. They are considering overall how it affects operations and what a corporate COVID-19 vaccine policy should contain. Many also want guidance on what they can be doing within the wider society to enhance vaccine update in communities.”

US biotech firm Moderna said Friday it was seeking clearance with regulators around the world to put 50 percent more coronavirus vaccine into each of its vials as a way to quickly boost current supply levels.
The company issued a statement after The New York Times first reported the US Food and Drug Administration had already cleared it to increase levels by 40 percent.
“In order to better maximize resources as well as maximize opportunities to deliver more doses into each market faster, Moderna has proposed filling vials with up to 15 doses of vaccine versus the previous 10 doses,” a spokesperson said in a statement to AFP.The spokesperson added the company was engaging in discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and authorities in other countries, and the increased level of doses wouldn’t require different vials to those currently in use.
“Any resulting change would be subject to final approval from the various regulatory authorities. Implementation of any such changes would be expected to be completed in approximately a two- to three-month period,” it said.
Citing sources close to the matter, the Times reported that the FDA had agreed to Moderna using 14 doses per vial, compared to the previous 10.
This would require retooling of production lines that would take less than ten weeks, or before the end of April, the newspaper said.“It would be a great step forward,” Moncef Slaoui, who was the chief scientific advisor for the federal vaccine development program under former president Donald Trump, told the Times.“I think it will have an impact in the short term.”
Some ten percent of Americans have so far received at least one Covid vaccine dose, with Moderna accounting for just under half the number and Pfizer just over half.The Biden administration announced Thursday it had reached a deal with both these companies to supply a total of 600 million doses of their two-shot courses by the end of July, enough to cover 90 percent of the US population.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

(PHILRECA) noted that by utilizing the EC sites, this could help both the national government and the local government units (LGUs) to “ensure proper and orderly rollout of the coronavirus vaccination plans.”Party-list Representative and House Assistant Minority Leader Sergio Dagooc sounded off the rural power utilities’ readiness in aiding the government on its vaccination undertaking, which is expected to pick up speed in the coming months.He recommended the use of the gymnasiums and multi-purpose halls of the 121 electric cooperatives all over the country, with him noting that “this way, more Filipinos, even those living in far-flung and remote communities, will be reached.”Dagooc similarly stated that the ECs “are ready to coordinate with their respective local government units to assist them in their vaccination plans.”In the State-spearheaded vaccination undertaking, it has been noted that one tricky part will be the logistics component – including the identification of vaccination sites as well as the provision of sufficient and reliable electricity, especially for vaccines that require special handling and refrigeration at negative Centigrade-levels.With PHILRECA’s offer, it is deemed that this could redound to “hitting two birds with one stone” in the required Covid-19 vaccination fixes – because they will not just be providing sites, but the electric utilities will also guarantee that the needed power supply will be there.
Dagooc cited a well-known fact that “there are communities still far away from hospitals and government centers; and there are also health centers that suffer from space constraints.”He noted these predicaments prompted the ECs “to become part of the solution by offering their compound and facilities for speedy, and vast yet with appropriate social distancing protocols, when the vaccination program is administered.”The Department of Energy (DOE) just recently called on the country’s power companies to lend a helping hand in the country’s inoculation process, because this is the ultimate measure that can finally pull the plug on the spread of the virus.
The department’s plea centers on the provision of “triple safeguard” in electricity service that will be so critically needed once the vaccination program starts.With that appeal, the ECs have come forward to offer help to the government given the reach of their service areas – especially in jurisdictions that are outside urban sprawls.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo on Friday, Feb. 12, expressed hope that the indemnification issues surrounding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines will soon be ironed out to ensure the smooth and timely roll out of the country’s vaccination program.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric DomingoDomingo, in an online interview, said that in other countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan, there are laws for indemnification or compensation in case of any vaccine injury.
“I hope they settle it soon because I think that’s the last remaining point – the indemnification clause of the contract,” Domingo said. If not, he noted that that the timeline of the vaccination program might be affected.Initially, Domingo said that World Heath Organization (WHO) was ready to ship the vaccines on Feb. 15. “We also prepared for it but I guess they will not ship the vaccines to the Philippines until the details of the contract have been settled,” he added.
Domingo said that there is no existing indemnification framework in the country. “In other countries, there is a legal framework for indemnification injury but here, we have no laws that will help, assist or compensate vaccine injuries,” he explained.
The need for indemnification, Domingo said, has never happened before because all products that the country procured prior the COVID-19 pandemic “are fully registered.”
However, Domingo said for the COVID-19 vaccines, these are under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). “We are asking the companies to give it to us even if they are not ready to commercialize it or sell it yet,” he explained. “Since we decided to use them under EUA, what the companies want is the government will be responsible for any injury,” he explained.This is the case for all vaccines under EUA, Domingo said. “Even the COVAX require an indemnification clause in their contract,” he added.
Domingo also expressed support to the proposal to set an Indemnification Fund so in case the the government needs it. “This is a common practice in other countries, for example there are adverse effects or death, the government can compensate the vaccine recipient or the family from the indemnification fund,” he added.
When he was still in Department of Health (DOH), Domingo said that they have been pushing for indemnification. “We should have something like thatbecause it also helps decrease hesitancy in vaccination,” he ended. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A group of Filipino nurses on Friday, Feb. 12, called for transparency and accountability in the government’s vaccine roll out amid “many controversial events” which made many health workers – including them – doubtful.
(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
The Filipino Nurses United (FNU) reiterated its call for “free, safe, and efficacious” vaccines and urged the government to ensure that the vaccination program remains transparent.
“What we need is a more reassuring government’s statement of concern and accountability to reinforce the motivation in seeking vaccine protection,” the FNU said. “What we need is transparency and consistency in words of care and actual support to health workers,” it added.FNU noted that “advanced vaccination of uniformed men, the recent changing of prioritization guidelines and other instances of breach of safety protocols by government agencies,” cast some doubts on the government’s transparency with the vaccination program especially among healthcare workers.
Likewise, FNU also called on the government to take “responsibility” of vaccine regulation, monitor adverse side effects and public support for treatment and hospitalization.“This should be done alongside a strengthened public health care system that has government-funded, strengthened public infection control measures of free mass testing, systematic contact tracing and adequate quarantine services and economic support for the people,” FNU ended.

The Muntinlupa City government is stepping up its campaign to encourage residents to get vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).Participants in Muntinlupa’s COVID-19 Vaccine Virtual Town Hall Meeting (Muntinlupa PIO / MANILA BULLETIN)
It launched a series of COVID-19 Vaccine Virtual Town Hall Meeting with health professionals from national government agencies.At least 100 participants from homeowners associations and urban poor groups attended the first meeting done in partnership with the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In the latest results of the city government’s survey on COVID-19 vaccine, 2,567 out of 4,074 respondents, or 63 percent, said they were willing to be vaccinated while 788, or 19.34 percent, said “no” and719, or 17.65 percent, did not answer and were classified as “unaccounted.”Of those who said “no,” the No. 1 reason was “side effects that may be experienced,” followed by “doubtful with the efficiency rate of the vaccine,” “fee of vaccination” and “conflict with current health conditions.”
During the virtual meeting, RITM Infection Prevention and Control Committee Chair Charissa Borja-Tabora emphasized the safety of vaccines, the process of clinical trials, and the role of vaccines in protecting individuals and communities.
Jesusa Joyce Cirunay of the FDA Center for Drugs Regulation and Research also discussed the agency’s Emergency Use Authorization and the stringent process and policies for the approval of vaccines.Muntinlupa Public Information Officer Tez Navarro said the initiative is part of the local government’s campaign to enable, inform, and motivate high priority groups to get the vaccine.“We will conduct a series of dialogues with individuals and communities to help them understand the value of vaccines so more Muntinlupeños will be convinced to be inoculated,” Navarro said.
Mayor Jaime Fresnedi had earlier announced that the city will allot P200 million, up from P170 million, for the city’s vaccination rollout.
Muntinlupa has ordered 400,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca to augment the supply that will be given by the national government.For the AstraZeneca vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) said “the recommended dosage is two doses given intramuscularly (0.5ml each) with an interval of 8 to 12 weeks. Longer dose intervals within the 8 to 12 weeks range are associated with greater vaccine efficacy.”
Muntinlupa’s COVID-19 vaccination plan and other best practices on public health were commended by officials from the Department of Health during the assessment visit of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 and Coordinated Operations to Defeat Epidemic (CODE) Team in the city last Feb. 5.
Under Muntinlupa’s COVID-19 vaccination plan, there will be 82 vaccination teams to be deployed in 35 vaccination posts and 8,200 target individuals will be vaccinated per day.
As of Feb. 11, Muntinlupa has 62 active cases out of 5,465 confirmed cases which include 5,231 recoveries and 172 deaths.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

President Joe Biden said Thursday the US had signed deals to acquire 200 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses as officials look to immunize the vast majority of the population by July.

The deals with Pfizer and Moderna, which the administration had announced it was seeking last month, increase the country’s total vaccine supply by fifty percent, to 600 million doses.
“Just this afternoon, we signed … final contracts for 100 million more Moderna and 100 million more Pfizer vaccines,” Biden said after touring the National Institutes of Health near Washington.“We’re now on track to have enough supply for 300 million Americans by the end of July,” he added. Both vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the US require two shots.
The US immunization campaign got off to a shaky start in December but has since improved: 46.4 million shots have now reached arms, and at least 34.7 million people have received one or more doses, roughly 10 percent of the population.
The vaccine drive entered a new phase Thursday as 6,500 pharmacies began scheduling shots, but a wave of optimism brought about by falling cases could soon be tested by dangerous variants.
A million doses were being shipped to drugstores and supermarket pharmacies nationwide, with chains announcing they would begin administering the first shots Friday.The pharmacy program will eventually expand to 40,000 outlets, while the federal government has also used emergency legislation to ramp up vaccine production, opened mass vaccine sites in stadiums, and has begun a separate program to reach underserved communities.
Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief advisor on the pandemic, told NBC that by April, vaccines would start being available to anyone who wanted them.
While the shots are currently only available to adults, officials have voiced hope that ongoing studies would allow them to be approved for children in the coming months.
– Cases falling –Since peaking on January 8 following the holiday season, the US outbreak has been in steep decline, with an average of just over 100,000 daily cases — down from more than 300,000.
Hospitalizations and fatalities are following suit — but the worst-hit country in the world is still expected to reach the latest grim milestone of half a million deaths this month.
And, because of the fragmented nature of the US health system, widespread confusion persists among the public over where and when they can get vaccinated.Stark racial and economic disparities have also emerged. In the capital Washington, vaccines have been disproportionately allocated to residents of the city’s affluent, white neighborhoods where people have been quicker to register by phone or online.– Rebound fears –
Between the number of people already vaccinated and the number of people who’ve already been infected, it’s thought that around 40 percent of the population might have some immunity, which is also contributing to the slowdown in new cases.
But while the numbers are headed in the right direction, experts warn it’s not time to get complacent.
The winter surge was compounded by people gathering over the holidays for Thanksgiving, Christmas and the New Year, and if those patterns were repeated during last Sunday’s Super Bowl, we can expect to see a spike.
The highly-transmissible B.1.1.7 variant that was first identified in Britain is also rapidly spreading in the US and is set to become the dominant strain by March, according to multiple studies.
This has the potential to reverse current progress, just as it did for example in Ireland, which had gotten its outbreak under control by late 2020, but was hit by a B.1.1.7 driven exponential wave in January and still recovering. A smaller amount of this variant can cause Covid-19, so attention has shifted toward better masking practices.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Wednesday that wearing a cloth mask on top of a medical mask, or knotting and tucking a medical mask to fit more snugly, offers significantly better protection against catching or spreading Covid-19.

The Healthcare Professionals’ Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) has opposed a Senate bill that proposes to allow local government units (LGUs) to expeditiously procure vaccines, saying that this measure will have a negative impact on the distribution of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines.“The HPAAC strongly opposes the passage of SB 2042 which expedites the purchase of vaccines against COVID-19 by exempting local government units from procurement laws,” the group said in a statement.The Senate Bill No. 2042, filed by Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri, states that “provinces, cities and municipalities may directly purchase vaccines for the protection against the coronavirus disease.”The proposed measure also allows LGUs to “secure other goods and services necessary for their storage, transport and distribution.”
In a statement on Jan. 11, the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF), said thatLGUs cannot procure and roll out COVID-19 vaccines on their own as this “must be coordinated with the national government, through the NTF and the DOH in a tripartite agreement involving local governments and pharmaceutical companies.”
The HPAAC warned that the proposed measure would cause “three big problems.”
According to HPAAC Convenor Dr. Antonio Dans, the bill “will lead to maldistribution of vaccines based on capacity to pay.”
“Nanawagan kami sa ating mga senators, lalo na kay Senator Zubiri, na sana i-reconsider nila ang provisions ng SB 2042, dahil malaki ang magiging impact nito sa tiwala ng mga tao, hindi lang sa effectiveness sa bakuna, dahil ang tiwala ng mga tao nagtitiwala na walang gulangan, walang agawan, patas-patas lang (We call on our senators, especially Senator Zubiri, to reconsider the provisions of SB 2042, because it will have a big impact on the people’s trust, not only on the effectiveness of the vaccine, but also on the people’s trust on the its fair distribution),” said Dans during a virtual briefing on Thursday night, Feb. 11.
The group said that the emergency use authorization being issued by the FDA is based on the declaration of a national emergency, noting that the pandemic is “not a local problem.”The group noted that if LGUs will be allowed to procure vaccines on their own, then “priorities will be defined by capacity to pay rather than need for the vaccine. If this were to happen, we would not be able to achieve the twin goals of reduction in mortality and maintenance of healthcare capacity.”
It said that prioritization and distribution of vaccines “requires centralized orchestration.”
“Paano nila naisip na gumawa ng Senate bill na iyan para sa isang bakuna na naka emergency use authorization pa lamang? Ang procurement ay para lamang sa mga regular na gamot na meron ng Certificate of Product Registration (How come they think of making that Senate bill for a vaccine that has only been given an emergency use authorization? Procurement is only for regular drugs that have a Certificate of Product Registration),” said Dr. Aileen Espina, a member of HPAAC.
“Naka EUA po sya. Hindi ba dapat ang national government lang ang bukod tanging magpro-procure? Bakit ganoon? Bakit nila shino-short circuit ang proseso (These vaccines are for EUA. Shouldn’t the national government be the only one to procure? Why so? Why do they have to shortcut the process),” she added.Espina said that the suggested priority groups for the COVID vaccination program is based on “science.”
“Bakit ba nagkaroon ng prioritization? Ibinasa kasi ito sa siyensya. May science ang pagprioritize: sino ba ang dapat mauna: based on need at pinakamalaki ang epekto nya in terms of achieving herd immunity earlier. (Why is there a prioritization? It is based on science. There’s science in prioritization: who should come first based on need and this will have a huge impact in terms of achieving herd immunity),” she said.Moreover, Dans said that the Senate bill “will bypass the required recommendation of leading experts in Health Technology Assessment.”
“Bypassing recommendations of this council will expose the people to the dangers of inappropriate technology, and may make local policy makers liable for wrong decisions,” he said. 
Another problem that the HPAAC sees in the proposed bill is that it “could drive increases in vaccine cost,” said Dans. “Tataas ang cost ng bakuna kasi hindi na iisa ang buyer. Meron single buyer advantagekung central government, pwede siyang makipag negotiate ng magandang presyo. Pero kung kanya-kanyang bili, syempre baka tumaas ang presyo (The cost of the vaccine will increase because there will no longer be a single buyer. There is a single buyer advantage if it will be done by thecentral government: it can negotiate a good price. But if we buy individually, of course the price may go up),” said Dans. The HPAAC said that “vaccines are our life vests out of a sinking ship. Let us use them well and distribute fairly and wisely.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Angara, as chairman of the Committee on Finance, led the hearing on Senate Bill 2042 filed by Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri, which would facilitate the procurement of vaccines by interested LGUs in the coming weeks and months.
“Alam natin na mahalaga ang ginagampanan na tungkulin ng ating mga LGUs lalo na sa ating kampanya laban sa COVID-19. Kaya maasahan ng ehekutibo na mabilis na aaksyunan ng kongreso ang panukalang batas na ito. (We know the important role of LGUs plays in the fight against COVID-19. The Executive Branch is assured that Congress would act on this bill.)” Angara said.
The bill was widely supported by the LGUs, as well as the National Task Force Against COVID-19, the Department of Health (DOH), Department of Finance (DOF) and the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), among others.
With the proposed law, Zubiri explained that the LGUs would no longer have to purchase vaccines from the lowest bidder as required by the law.
“May mga bakuna naman available na medyo mas mahal ng kaunti pero readily available na by the second or early third quarter. Time is of the element dito,” Zubiri said. (There are vaccines that are available that have slightly high price tags and are readily available but are only ready on the second and third quarter of the year.)National Task Force (NTF) chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the bill would“greatly affect the expeditious acquisition of our needed vaccines.”Galvez said some 27 million vaccine doses have been purchased so far by the private sector and the LGUs.
He disclosed that a memorandum is currently being drafted for President Duterte to certify the bill as urgent.
“Ang mga LGU naka pirma na ngayon, pati na kami sa tripartite agreement and it will really help us because it will give us legal cover for us to pursue yung nagawa na (if done) tripartite agreement,” Galvez said.(The LGUs have signed this, including us in the Executive).)Quirino Governor and Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines (ULAP) president Dakila Cua said the proposed law would provide the LGUs with some peace of mind in undertaking the purchase of vaccines for their constituents as it would provide them with “solid legal footing.”

According to Fernando, the province is currently “readying its funds for the vaccine” by “augmenting the needs of its cities and municipalities.”
“Kung tutuusin… hindi po kakayanin ng provincial government kung lahat-lahat talaga ito.

They are now also set to enter into tripartite agreements with the national government and the pharmaceutical companies to purchase the COVID-19 vaccine.
Fernando said that, in fact, the municipality of Pulilan has already signed an agreement with AstraZeneca for the procurement of P20 million worth of vaccine.
Fernando also said that the provincial government is working on polishing the logistics of the vaccine as he said, it “is very critical for the success of our vaccination program.”Currently, they already identified The Pavilion, Hiyas ng Bulacan Convention Center as a facility-based vaccination center for workers of Bulacan Medical Center, who will be prioritized for the inoculation.

Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto on Thursday called on the public not to judge novel coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines based on where they came from — especially if these are tagged “Made in China”.
Senator Ralph Recto (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
“We should not demonize a vaccine because of its country of origin. Let science be the guide, not superstition,” Recto said.
“If our scientists from UP (Universtity of the Philippines) and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) will say after thorough evaluation that it is good, then who are we to doubt their findings? Science is the light that will lead us out of pandemic darkness,” he pointed out.The Senate official was particularly commenting on the announcement that a shipment of600,000 doses of CoronaVac, the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, is scheduled to arrive in the Philippines on February 23.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said the government of China donated 100,000 more shots of the vaccine for the Philippines’ defense department, raising the total number of incoming vaccine supply to 600,000.
The FDA has yet to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for CoronaVac. So far, EUAs have been issued to Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.
Recto said: “Knee-jerk reaction against anything ‘Made in China’ does not help in the fight against COVID-19. And any doubt on any vaccine in particular fuels vaccine hesitancy in general.”The Philippines’ territorial dispute with China, he noted, should not be linked to the vaccines.
“That they have occupied some of our territories is another issue. We can contest one issue and cooperate on others,” he said.
“At kung bigay ang mga bakunang iyan (And if those vaccines are donated), we should say ‘Kung Hei Fat Choi and Maraming Salamat Po (Thank You Very Much)!’” Recto added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III pointed this out during a hearing today by the Senate finance committee chaired by Senator Juan Edgardo ’’Sonny’’ M. Angara.Galvez said negotiations for a supply agreement are still going on with Sinovax, Cocovax, Moderna and AstraZeneca. 
What this means, according to Senate Minority Leader Franklin M. Drilon, is that there is still no firm commitment that vaccines would be arriving in the country and expectations of vaccines coming to the country are just based on the good relations of Galvez.The only vaccines that are scheduled to arrive in the Philippines are the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines that do not need a supply agreement because they are donations from China.Galvez explained that there are term sheets that had locked initial agreements to buy the vaccines and that 108 million doses had been secured.Galvez said that when the Sinovac shipment arrive on February 23, there would be a technical inspection of the vaccines in two to three days followed by vaccination but this depends on the issuance by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) of emergency use authority (EUA) for the Sinovac vaccines. 
FDA Director General Eric Domingo said Russia’s Sputnik vaccine has not complied with the required documentations before a EUA is given. There is also no application for a EUA for Sinopharm from the Chinese government. The Chinese government has reportedly no representative of Sinopharm. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A vaccine expert on Thursday said benefits of being vaccinated with coronavirus disease(COVID-19) vaccine ’’far, far outweighs’’ the risks.
Dr. Lulu Bravo
Dr. Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, stressed this during a ‘’Bakit Bakuna Roadshow’’ for COVID-19 Vaccine Program for Communities forum at the House of Representatives today.
‘’It (vaccination) is safe even in immunocompromised people,’’ she explained, noting thatthere are now several vaccines being used globally.Bravo emphasized that no vaccine is 100 percent safe and is not 100 percent effective.
She, however, emphasized that some vaccines prevent cancer and prevent the development of antibiotic resistance.
Vaccines also empower women and promote peace, she said.
‘’Listen to our experts,’’ Bravo said, adding that a lot of communicating on the good effects of the COVID-19 vaccines is needed.Keep safe as the national immunization program is now underway, she stressed.
Bravo also assured that the government is ready to deal with the adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccination.As the country has been coming to grips with the deadly effects of COVID-19 since its arrival in the Philippines from a couple in Wuhan, China in January 2020, Dr. Rontgene Solante, expert, Adult Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, said there is now increasing clinical experience and decreasing hospital volume.This has also led to lower viral load exposure due to the use of masks and social distancing, he added.
But the COVID-19 pandemic now affects 106 million globally with the majority of cases are recorded in the US and Europe.
Like Bravo, Solante said vaccines do more good than harm. He, likewise, rejects rumors that the vaccines produced by several pharmaceutical companies in the world were manufactured hastily.
These vaccines underwent trials, he added.
Solante noted that vaccines are more efficacious in older patients, from 60 years and above.Vaccines, according to him, have the ability to protect against severe diseases and mortality.
Solante said that science is not perfect but the impact of vaccines is ‘’beyond description.’’
He also stressed the need for increased attention to vaccines now as they provide a fertile ground for misinformation
‘’it has been politicized,’’ he lamented.
Rep. Janette Garin, a former Department of Health (DOH) secretary, discussed the issue of promoting vaccine education to strengthen community readiness.
Like Solante, Garin stressed the need for the Philippines to be aggressive in its vaccination program.
‘’Listen to the real experts,’’ she said, adding that Filipinos should think on how they can help the government. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

FDA-Director General Rolando Enrique Domingo, however, clarified that the special permit is for “one-time importation” and for “future use.”
“Yes. The PSG applied and complied with all requirements for the CSP. It was granted yesterday,” said Domingo.
Domingo said the PSG applied for the CSP last Jan. 18 and “they recently completed all requirements.”
“The PSG Hospital takes full responsibility for the vaccines and will report utilization and outcomes to FDA,” he said.The CSP is a special permit issued by the FDA that grants an entity the privilege to avail of an unregistered drug, medical device, or food product.
The FDA’s grantof such permitwas first announced by Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque during his briefing on Thursday afternoon (Feb. 11)

BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN — Brunei’s Ministry of Health said in a press release on Wednesday that the country received a batch of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine donated by China on Tuesday and is reviewing a vaccination program.
In March 2020, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brunei provided assistance to China, which underscored the close bilateral cooperation towards managing the pandemic, the ministry said.

The ministry said they are still reviewing the plans for the distribution of the vaccine in accordance with the recommended priorities.According to the Chinese embassy in Brunei, the sultanate’s Second Minister of Foreign Affairs Haji Erywan attended the handover ceremony on Tuesday and held a discussion with Yu Hong, Chinese ambassador to Brunei.
Haji Erywan expressed his gratitude to China, saying that this is the first batch of COVID-19 vaccine received by Brunei, which is considered a gift given by the Chinese people to the people of Brunei, reflecting the long-term traditional friendship and deep mutual trust between the two countries.
He said that the Chinese vaccine would play an important role for Brunei to overcome the epidemic. Brunei is willing to take the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries and the 30th anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations as an opportunity to promote bilateral relations and China-ASEAN relations to a new level, he added.
Ambassador Yu told Haji Erywan that China’s COVID-19 vaccine assistance to Brunei reflects a new climax of bilateral cooperation against the COVID-19 pandemic.“At present, global COVID-19 vaccines are mainly distributed to a few developed countries, although the vaccines are crucial for all countries to restart their economies. Under such circumstances, China’s vaccine assistance to Brunei highlights the true friendship between our two countries,” the ambassador said during the discussion.
Yu said that China has been earnestly acting on its pledge that once developed and deployed, Chinese vaccines will be made a global public good, contributing to the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in developing countries.
“China is providing vaccine aid to 53 developing countries, and we have exported and are exporting vaccines to 22 countries. China also actively participates in the WHO-led COVAX and decided to provide 10 million doses of vaccines to the program, mainly to meet the demand of developing countries,” Yu said.“China supports domestic companies in conducting joint R&D and manufacturing with foreign partners, and in exporting vaccines to countries that are in urgent need of vaccines, have certified Chinese vaccines, and authorized their emergency use,” she added.
According to the ambassador, China’s vaccine assistance to Brunei “fully reflects the high level of the China-Brunei strategic cooperative partnership and the true friendship between the two peoples.”
Yu expressed hope that the vaccine assistance will help contribute to the final victory of Brunei in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic.
Brunei reported one new imported case of COVID-19 on Wednesday, bringing the national tally to 183.
A total of 42 imported cases have been confirmed since the last local infection case on May 6, 2020. At present, Brunei has recorded 280 days without COVID-19 local infection cases. Five active cases are still being treated at the National Isolation Center and all of them are in a stable condition.There have been three deaths resulted from COVID-19 in Brunei and 175 patients have recovered.

In line with the vaccine procurement protocols, Chief Justice Diosdado M. Peralta will coordinate with the National Task Force (NTF) against COVID-19 and the Department of Health (DOH).
A statement issued by the SC’s public information office (PIO) stated that the purchase of the vaccines was approved by the justices during their full court session last January 26.The purchase was recommended by the SC’s Office of Administrative Services and the Office of the Court Administrator.
The budget will come from the regular appropriations or savings of the SC, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals, and the lower courts, the PIO said.
“The vaccination of all judiciary employees especially those in the lower courts will mean that our judges and their personnel, who have direct contact with litigants and lawyers on a daily basis, will be further protected….” it said.
“This in turn will ensure that our courts will be able to better function and serve the public during the pandemic,” it added.
At the start of COVID-19 in March last year, the SC devised ways to combat the spread of the disease.
“The Court immediately came out with appropriate guidelines as precautionary measure and created a Task Force led by Court Administrator Jose Midas P. Marquez,” the PIO said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

After just 10 days of construction, the Manila city government officially opened its COVID-19 Vaccine Storage Facility at Sta. Ana Hospital on Thursday, Feb. 11.
(MANILA CITY PIO / MANILA BULLETIN)
The launch came after the city government received the three Haier -86 degrees celsius ULT freezers that can store COVID-19 vaccines from American multinational pharmaceutical company Pfizer.
The facility located on the 7th floor of Sta. Ana Hospital is also equipped with five Haier HYC-390 refrigeration units which can store vaccine doses from AstraZeneca and Sinovac and four other biomedical freezers that can store Janssen and Moderna vaccine vials.Each freezer has an uninterrupted power supply (UPS) that would give them 10 to 15 minutes lead time before the generators take over in case of a brownout. This is to protect the integrity of the vaccines. Some have been reported to spoil easily with changes in temperature.
The Manila city government also bought 50 transport coolers that will be used to deploy the vaccines to various vaccination sites.
Manila City Engineer Armand Andres said the whole area measures around 100 square meters. It is fitted with vinyl, anti-bacterial flooring.
Eleven closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras were also installed to monitor the area.Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso, along with other city government officials, inspected the facility on Thursday, Feb. 11.
On Jan. 11, the city government secured an advance purchase of 800,000 COVID-19 vaccines from British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.
Domagoso on Feb. 8 said he is optimistic that the vaccines will arrive “sooner than expected.”As part of its preparations for the COVID-19 vaccination drive, the city government has been conducting vaccination simulation activities to identify future problems that they may encounter.
They have also identified at least 18 vaccination sites in the city. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Philippine National Police (PNP) has mobilized special units that will run after persons and groups engaged in smuggling and selling vaccines for the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in the country.
(MANILA BULLETIN)
PNP chief Gen. Debold Sinas said he had already instructed the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) and the Intelligence Group (IG) to continuously monitor black market activities for counterfeit and unauthorized COVID-19 vaccines that may have entered the country.
“The CIDG, IG and National Operational Support Units will launch operations to prevent the entry, distribution and sale of COVID-9 vaccines without proper authorization from the concerned government agencies,” said Sinas.On Tuesday, the National Task Force on COVID-19, the Department of Health and the Food and Drugs Administration reminded the public that the selling of COVID-19 vaccines are prohibited.This, after reports have been circulating that COVID-19 vaccines are being sold in Manila and other parts of the country, the vaccines are believed to have been smuggled into the Philippines from other countries, especially China.
The issue of smuggled COVID-10 vaccines, however, dragged Malacañang into controversy after the military admitted that soldiers assigned to the Presidential Security Group were already inoculated as early as last year, allegedly by smuggled vaccines.Based on the policy of the World Health Organization, only the governments could strike a deal for the purchase of COVID vaccines with pharmaceutical companies. Even local government units and private companies have to seek approval from the Philippine government for instance to buy the vaccines through a tripartite agreement—Government, pharmaceutical company and third party that include companies and LGUs.
“As emphasized by DOH, NTF and FDA no particular brand of COVID-19 vaccine is authorized to be marketed commercially in the Philippines. The PNP will strictly implement this official policy, and take appropriate police action in accordance with existing laws,” said Sinas.
The PNP has already finished its PNP Vaccination Plan “Caduceus”. The plan involves threat assessment, contingency planning and simulation exercises in pilot areas; as well as organization of the Medical Reserve Forces, inter-agency coordination, and operational planning by Police Regional Offices.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

GENEVA — The AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine can be used for people aged over 65, and also where coronavirus variants of concern are circulating, WHO experts said Wednesday, soothing fears about the jab.

The World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) issued interim recommendations for when and how to use the two-shot vaccine, which has yet to receive WHO emergency use authorization.
The announcement came after the vaccine suffered setbacks, raising questions about whether it should be used on older people, or in places where a variant of the virus first found in South Africa is circulating.SAGE chief Alejandro Cravioto acknowledged the lack of data on the vaccine’s efficacy for people aged over 65, which has prompted a number of countries to withhold recommending its use in older people, who are by far the most vulnerable to the virus.
But the experts concluded that given its performance with younger adults, “it is likely that the vaccine will be found to be efficacious in older persons. The trial data indicate that the vaccine is safe for this age group.”
Cravioto told journalists: “We feel that the response of this group cannot be any different from groups of a younger age.”
SAGE, he said, recommends it be used “for 18 years and above, without an upper age limit”.Cravioto said the experts were awaiting more specific data on the vaccine’s efficacy in people over 65, but said it “would not be appropriate” to wait with its recommendations.
“We have thousands of people dying,” he stressed.
“Anything we can do to use a product that might reduce that is totally justified, even if the information is not as complete as we would like.”
Effectiveness against variantsThe experts also said they had discussed the effectiveness of the vaccine when faced with emerging coronavirus variants of concern, and in particular the one first spotted in South Africa.
The country has decided to put off using AstraZeneca jabs in a planned vaccination programme over concerns about their efficacy against the variant.
Alarm was raised when a South African study concluded the AstraZeneca vaccine provided only “minimal” protection against mild to moderate Covid-19 caused by the variant.
But the WHO insisted more data was needed, pointing to the study’s scope, methodology and small size.
And SAGE recommended Wednesday that the vaccine could be used “even if variants are present in a country”.The WHO’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the benefits would “far outweigh” any risks, as variants may not be the predominant strains circulating in that country.
The SAGE experts also said the vaccine proved more effective when the interval between the doses was extended to between eight and 12 weeks.
Equitable distribution
The Covax system was set up by WHO, the Gavi vaccine alliance and CEPI to procure Covid-19 jabs and ensure their equitable distribution worldwide.
The AstraZeneca vaccine accounts for almost all of the 337.2 million doses Covax is preparing to ship before July to some 145 countries, covering three percent of their combined population.
However, the AstraZeneca jab first needs emergency use authorisation from the WHO, which is set to make a decision next week. Only the Pfizer vaccine has so far received the WHO stamp of approval.
Gavi chief Seth Berkley called SAGE’s announcement, which clears a path towards authorisation, “excellent news”.
“We will continue with our plans to roll this vaccine out worldwide,” he said.
Andrew Pollard, from Oxford University’s Vaccine Group, meanwhile said SAGE’s recommendations were “an important milestone in extending access to the Oxford-AZ vaccine to all corners of the world.”
But Thomas Cueni, head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, sounded a note of caution.
Despite the industry’s desire for a swift and equitable rollout, “we warn against setting unrealistic expectations given the inherent risk of vaccine development and the complexity of scaling up manufacturing from scratch,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Australia is shoring up its support to the Philippines and its partners in the Indo-Pacific region to ensure an equitable and efficient distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, Australian Ambassador to the Philippines Steven J. Robinson AO said on Wednesday.
Australian Ambassador to the Philippines Steven J. Robinson
In a tweet, Robinson said he met recently with the three secretaries responsible for the roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines namely, National Task Force chief Carlito Galvez, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and National Action Plan deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon to get an update on the vaccine and to see how Australia can further support the distribution through the COVAX facility.
COVAX is a coalition that includes the Vaccine Alliance known as Gavi and the World Health Organization (WHO) and is funded by donations from governments, multilateral institutions and foundations. It aims to procure COVID-19 vaccines in bulk and send them to poorer nations that are incapable of competing with wealthy countries in securing contracts with major drug companies.During their meeting, the Australian ambassador assured the secretaries that in the “spirit of mateship and Bayanihan”, the Embassy will do all it can to assist.
In October last year, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne announced that Australia has committed $500 million to support access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and to promote health security in the Indo-Pacific, including in the Philippines.
According to the Embassy in Manila, included in the commitment is a $21-million contribution to the new ASEAN Center for Public Health Emergencies and Emerging Diseases, which will help combat COVID-19 and prepare the region for future pandemics.
Also part of the commitment is the support to the Philippines for assistance with vaccines over the next two years, including logistics, public health support and information.“Australia was able to redirect its 2020 development assistance programs to reinforce the Philippine response to the pandemic,” a statement from the Embassy said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The commissioner also assured the public that they “will protect the country against unregistered and illegal goods.”
The full-scale simulation exercise of cold chain logistics and management of the vaccines was spearheaded by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19.
It began with the arrival of goods at the airport; then pre-customs clearance at the Port of NAIA one-stop-shop; continuing with the transportation of the vaccines; then the unloading, receiving, and inspection of vaccines in the cold chain storage facility at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).The activity aims to determine the authorities’ readiness as well as to ensure the effective and efficient flow of distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines from the airport to the health facilities.

In a letter addressed to Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III, Zamora asked if he could be the first person to take the jab in San Juan City in order to allay the fears of his constituents about the vaccines.
“We very well understand that there is a prioritization list as identified by the IATF, on top of which are the health care workers and medical frontliners. However, the undersigned (Zamora) is volunteering in order to increase the trust and confidence of our citizens in the vaccination process and to encourage them to have themselves inoculated as well.” Zamora said in his letter.“The City of San Juan has been earnestly campaigning for people to register for the COVID-19 vaccine. In fact, we have started the online and offline registration as early as 4 January 2021. Unfortunately, as of this time, and after a month and six days, we only have a total of 18,602 registrants or just 15% of the city’s total population, still far from our target of 70% (85,526 people) to achieve herd immunity.” he added.
Zamora, together with other city government officials, launched on Tuesday a house-to-house information drive on COVID-19 to increase the residents’ knowledge about the virus and the vaccines, and also to urge them to be inoculated against it.
An on-the-spot online registration station was also set up for residents who have no access to the internet so they can be added to the city’s list of vaccine beneficiaries.

“We’re getting a lot of comments that they want to wait or they want others to go ahead. Basically, there are ’nos with reservation.’ So the plan now is to answer those reservations with our media campaign or our communications plan or marketing campaign,” Gatchalian said.“We want to make sure that this early we can convert the ‘nos with reservations’ to ‘yes in register’,” he added.
So far, Gatchalian said 15,000 Valenzuela residents have registered to be vaccinated, which the mayor said is still a “long way to go” from the city’s 320,000 target, but said the city still “has a lot of time” to achieve its goal.

Vice President Leni Robredo is willing to be inoculated first with the coronavirus vaccine in public to encourage Filipinos to get vaccinated, too, but clarified that she will follow the prioritization list released by the government’s pandemic task force.
In a video message posted on her official Facebook page, the vice president said she has no qualms receiving the vaccine in public if that will help assure the public of its safety.“The IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases) released a prioritization (list). We will follow that. Our priority is the healthcare professionals and elderly. But if we need to get the vaccine in public to encourage the people to get vaccinated, we will do that,” she said in Filipino.
The video is quite informal compared to Robredo’s recorded public addresses in the past. She answers frequently asked questions about the COVID-19 vaccination plan in a bid to help boost the public confidence in vaccines.
The lady official shared that when she first learned there was already a vaccine against COVID-19, she felt hopeful that there will be a long-term “clear pathway.”
“It was in early November when we first heard of Pfizer and BioNTech. When we heard the news, there’s a change—we feel different. We became hopeful that there will be a vaccine. It is very uplifting that we will not be on survival mode anymore because the news of the vaccine, it’s like there’s a clear pathway that’s long-term. There’s light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.Pfizer and its partner BioNTech first announced the news about the vaccine and its efficacy rate in November. The vaccines produced by Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna were the first-ever to use mRNA, a technology that uses the cells’ memory to “remember” the virus rather than injecting a person with a live but weakened version of the virus.

The storage facility also has a back-up generator in case of any power interruption.
The local chief executive emphasized the sensitivity of the vaccine amid any change in temperature. He urged Dr. Padilla to direct the hospital personnel to remain cautious and prudent at all times.
“Once the vaccines are there, we will not stop — Monday to Sunday, hindi tayo hihinto. Hihinto lang tayo kapag tapos na (We will not stop. We’re going to stop once we’re done). This is saving lives, protecting lives, yun ang goal,” Domagoso said.
“Ang habol ko ay walang mamamatay. Hindi na baleng may patuloy na infection, basta wala nang mamamatay. Kawawa ang tao (My aim is to stop the deaths due to COVID. It is not uncommon for the infection to continue, as long as no one will die anymore. The people are pitiful),” he added.
According to Sta. Ana Hospital Biomedical Specialist Walter Rigonan, the city government’s 12 COVID-19 vaccine freezers can accommodate the following:
2 units of -10 to -25 freezer: 5,200 vials each
2 units of -10 to -30 freezer: 17,2000 vials each
3 units of -70 freezer: 35,000 vials each
5 units of 2-8 degrees freezer: 8,200 vials each
The storage facility on the 7th floor of Sta. Ana Hospital can be used for all the vaccine brands available in the market because it is equipped with different types of refrigeration units. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

But CPP spokesperson Marco Valbuena suggested that the vaccine delivery in far-flung areas be handled by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Philippine Red Cross and other civilian humanitarian agencies, adding that they are more fit to handle the transportation, distribution and inoculation because of their medical training.
“We strongly suggest that Covid-19 vaccines not be transported in AFP military vehicles, especially those which are not properly marked and carrying armed soldiers… Non-Red cross vehicles that will be used as Covid-19 vaccine transporters must be clearly and properly marked with a red cross over white background,” said the CPP in a statement.In discouraging police and military personnel to transport the vaccines, the CPP said security forces may take advantage of the situation to conduct combat and psywar operations, alleging that the military had done this in the past.
It added that some people in far-flung areas that are considered by the military as CPP-New People’s Army supporters may even be required to surrender before being inoculated.
“Using AFP to transport and vaccines will not encourage people to be vaccinated especially in many areas in the countryside where people are traumatized by military garrisoning of their communities and helicopter gunships firing missiles,” the statement read.
In his weekly address to the nation, Duterte asked the CPP-NPA not to intercept COVID-19 vaccines, saying it is part of the Filipino rights to get vaccinated amid the continuous threat of mass infection.Duterte added that the vaccines will also be made available to communist rebels.
In a statement, the CPP said that they respect the right of the people to get vaccinated.
“It is a matter of principle for the NPA to respect all humanitarian undertakings that benefit the masses. Thus, the NPA will ensure that transportation of Covid-19 vaccines will be provided a humanitarian corridor for safe and unimpeded passage in guerrilla bases and zones,” the statement read.

President Duterte issued the stern warning during his television address Monday night.
Duterte had earlier promised the swift and orderly distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines to the people, initially to the country’s medical frontliners, seniors, poor citizens, and essential workforce. The county’s first shipment of the coronavirus vaccines is expected to arrive next week.“Let me address to every government worker, lahat tayo, do not delay and do not hinder or obstruct the smooth flow na nakikita ninyo, from the time of the arrival to the time of clearance,” Duterte said, referring to the vaccine supplies.
“Maybe ang trabaho lang ninyo Customs, magtingin (Maybe the work of customs is just look) You have no business na buksan-buksan dyan (to open the package). You’re not allowed to do that. I am not allowing you, anybody diyan sa airpot na magbukas bukas (anybody in the airport to open them),” he added.

Transport 20 minutes. Receiving and inspection 15 minutes… allocated time of 120 minutes. Hopefully, this will be cut by half, 60 minutes,” he said.The President, on the other hand, authorized the deployment of police personnel to ensure the safe transport of vaccine supplies across the country. He said vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. could tap these police escorts to find the “fastest” route for the vaccine distribution.
“The PNP (Philippine National Police) should provide escorts that would ensure the fastest way of, for the vaccines to arrive in their storage at saka ‘yung even in the matter of transporting from one facility to the other. Ihatid doon sa mga local governments. The police will provide that kind of mobility,” he said.

during the transport of the vaccines to far-flung areas.

President Rodrigo Duterte
Duterte made the statement as the government awaits the arrival of the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines from the World Health Organization (WHO)-led COVAX Facility next week.
In his weekly public address on Monday evening, Duterte asked the CPP to ensure the safe transport of the vaccines.“We might be able to issue this appeal–not a warning– I am appealing… The Communist Party must guarantee that the vaccines, in the course of their being transported to areas where there are no city health officers or medical persons, ‘wag ninyong galawin ang medisina (do not touch the medicines),” he said.
“Allow the vaccines to be transported freely and safely. I am asking you now to observe that rule because that is for the Filipino people,” he added.
According to the President, the CPP should not cause trouble like when its members intercepted the delivery of the government’s pandemic subsidy because it is the people’s money used to pay for the vaccines.
“The money belongs to the Filipino people. The credit goes to no one,” Duterte said.“Pera ninyo ito. So natural lang na kayong mga (This is the people’s money so it is only natural that the) members ng Communist Party of the Philippines and the allied– NPA (New People’s Army), NDF (National Democratic Front), or whatever– kindly observe the rules of humanity,” he added.
Despite rejecting the annual holiday truce in December last year, President Duterte said that the COVID-19 vaccines that the government will procure will be made available to the communist rebels.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement as he announced that the government is “100 percent ready” for the vaccine rollout with the first batch of vaccines from the COVAX Facility arriving next week.
Roque said that as a senior citizen, the 75-year-old Duterte will be prioritized in the program.“Ang Presidente (The President) will enjoy priority dahil nga po siya ay (since he is a) senior citizen,” he said.
Senior citizens are the second on the government’s vaccination priority list next to healthcare workers.
According to Roque, President Duterte wants to be one of the first Filipinos to receive the vaccine to boost the confidence of the public.
“Importante rin po na magpabakuna siya para sa vaccine confidence. So inaasahan natin na isa siya sa pinaka-una (It’s important that he gets vaccinated to boost vaccine confidence. We expect that he will be one of the first people),” he said.“The issue is if he will do it public or privately and that’s his right. Pero yung pagpapabakuna po niya is intended to tell everyone na ang bakuna ay ligtas at epektibo kapag inissuehan po ng EUA ng ating gobyerno (But his vaccination is intended to tell everyone that the vaccines are safe and effective once they are issued the emergency use authorization),” he added.
President Duterte has expressed willingness to be the first Filipino to receive a vaccine jab in the Philippines.
However, Roque said last month that Duterte will receive the vaccine in private and will be injected into his buttocks. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Domagoso also affirmed that the capital city is ready for the arrival of the vaccines.
“I am optimistic that it will arrive soon, and we are ready. Not to raise hope for the people of Manila but I am optimistic that it will arrive soon, sooner than expected,” he told reporters on Monday.The Manila city government entered a tripartite agreement with British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 for the advanced purchase of 800,000 vaccines.This is seen to benefit around 400,000 people. Frontline health workers, senior citizens and members of other vulnerable sectors, uniformed personnel, public school teachers, and church workers are among the city government’s priority list for the vaccine.Next to be inoculated are those who pre-registered at the manilacovid19vaccine.com. As of Monday, over 80,000 people have reserved their slots at the website.The Manila mayor said they are nearly done in constructing the city’s COVID-19 Vaccine Storage Facility at the 7th floor of Sta. Ana Hospital.It is equipped with several refrigeration units that can store different brands of COVID-19 vaccines.
These include five Haier HYC-390 refrigeration units which can store vaccine doses from AstraZeneca and Sinovac, four other biomedical freezers which can store Janssen and Moderna vaccine vials, and three -86 degrees celsius ULT Freezers from Haier which can store Pfizer vaccines.
The city government also acquired 50 transport coolers that will be used to deliver the vaccines.Vaccination simulation activities are also being conducted in the city to identify possible problems that they may arise during the actual vaccination drive. At least 18 vaccination sites in the city have also been identified. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

With the country’s coronavirus vaccine confidence still low, Vice President and opposition leader Leni Robredo said the government should let health experts do the talking on the safety of vaccines.
(JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“We should listen to health experts. They should be the ones assuring the people. The doctors, the ones who understand (how the vaccines work) should be the ones doing the talking. Not us, because we are not health experts,” she said in Filipino over dzXL Sunday, Feb. 7.
The vice president urged health experts “to go out in public” to assure the people that it is safe to take the vaccine.Robredo lamented that the latest survey showed that 47 percent of the respondents refused to be inoculated with the vaccine, which the government hopes to start rolling out this month.
“This is worrisome because if the 47 percent don’t like, how can we achieve (herd immunity)?,” she said, referring to the inoculation of a large part of the population to make a large swath of people immune to the virus.Robredo believes that information drive is lacking. “The confidence level of the people (on the vaccine) is still very low. I think we are lacking in terms of communication. Our information campaign should be aggressive.”
The vice president reiterated that the people need assurance that the vaccine is safe.“We should strengthen the communication (with people) because if there is no confidence, even if the vaccine is there, we will not achieve herd immunity,” she said.The Philippines expects the first tranche of China-made Sinovac vaccines to arrive this month, with health workers, seniors, people with co-morbidities, and uniformed personnel as the first in line to get the vaccine.But even as the start of the vaccination program looms near, polls showed that nearly half of Filipinos will not get vaccinated against COVID-19 because of safety concerns.Out of 2,400 Filipino adults who took the survey, only 32 percent said they are willing to be vaccinated while 21 percent are undecided. The biggest concern is the safety of the virus. That’s followed by concerns about its price while some believe that a vaccine is not needed to combat the coronavirus. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Afghanistan received half a million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine from India Sunday, the first consignment to arrive in the country that was hit hard by the virus last year.
Health workers unload the first shipment boxes of Covid-19 coronavirus vaccine donated by the Indian government at Kabul airport on February 7
The AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine is being produced by Serum Institute of India, with the consignment of doses arriving in Kabul as part of a program by New Delhi to distribute the vaccine to its neighbours.
“We received 500,000 doses of vaccines for Covid-19 patients from the government of India,” Afghanistan’s Acting Health Minister Wahid Majrooh told reporters at Kabul airport as he received the consignment.The doses will initially be administered to the country’s health workers and elderly citizens with a history of chronic ailments as per guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation, he said.
Majrooh said Kabul plans to ultimately cover 60 percent of the population and was working with international agencies like the World Bank, Asian Development and the European Union to procure more jabs.
The coronavirus entered Afghanistan in February 2020 as thousands of migrants returned from neighbouring Iran, at the time the worst-affected nation in the region.In the following months Afghanistan, already wracked by decades of war, was ravaged by Covid-19, particularly in Kabul.In August last year a health ministry survey revealed that 10 million people — nearly a third of the country’s population — had been infected with the coronavirus.
The country of 32 million people has limited testing capacity, but recent months have seen a decline in new infections, with officials registering about 55,300 confirmed cases so far and about 2,400 deaths. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) has allowed mining companies to re-align their social development funds the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.MGB has released a memorandum allowing mining companies to use their funds under SDMP and Safety and Health Program (SHP) for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccine for the mass vaccination within mining communities.The memorandum aims to help the government in purchasing an additional supply of COVID-19 vaccines through the initiatives of the mining industry.Such a decision was made upon the request of some mining companies to the government, though no official lobby has been made. These funds include those for existing programs their annual Social Development and Management Program (SDMP).In a text message, Rocky Dimaculangan, vice president for corporate communications at Chamber of Mines of the Philippines (COMP), said many COMP members did request the MGB’s permission for the realignment of funds “given that mass immunization from the deadly virus is our nation’s most pressing concern at the moment”. 
“We entrust the procurement and administration of the vaccine to our members who have a better sense of the situation on the ground,” Dimaculangan said.“We encourage the widest possible coverage of the vaccination campaign and will monitor the progress of our members’ vaccination program,” he added.COMP is composed of some of the largest mining companies in the Philippines.For his part, MGB Director Wilfredo Moncano said there was no official lobby made by mining companies regarding the decision of the agency.
“We just thought that since in 2020 we allowed the re-alignment of SDMP funds for COVID-19 response by mining companies, it will also be logical that MGB can allow the re-alignment of said funds in 2021 for the procurement of the vaccine,” Moncano said in a separate text exchange.“We welcome the MGB decision allowing the minerals development industry to realign SDMP and SHP funds for the vaccination of employees and members of host communities. This will provide a big boost to the government’s Covid-19 vaccination program and help hasten the nation’s recovery from this pandemic,” Dimaculangan said. 
Moncano noted, however, that mining companies should first consult with the representatives from their respective host and neighboring communities to avoid redundancy in the vaccination.This, as the host local government unit (LGU) may have already allotted its own funds for the vaccine procurement.He also said that it’s the host communities that will be the one to determine what projects, programs, or activities that will be deferred or canceled amid the re-alignment of the SDMP fund allocation.The SDMP requires mining companies to set aside funds for the development and implementation of community programs, projects, and activities for the host and neighboring communities of a mining project.This is a five-year plan geared towards the development of a responsible, self-reliant, and resource-based community capable of developing, implementing, and managing development programs, projects, and activities.

Malacañang is counting on the country’s doctors to help ensure the list of persons with comorbidity who are entitled to the free coronavirus vaccines will be free of fraud.(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
According to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, doctors are unlikely to lie about the health condition of their patients when issuing medical certificates to facilitate their vaccination.Persons with comorbidity or those with pre-existing chronic diseases are now ranked third in the list of priority groups in the government’s immunization program. The list of priority recipients has been expanded by the government pandemic task force ahead of the arrival of the supplies this month.
“Talagang napakainit po ng balitaktakan diyan, kasi nga may mga nagsasabi na kapag pinayagan iyong may comorbidities maraming mandaraya para lang mauna sa pila. Sabi ko naman, pagtiwalaan naman siguro ang ating mga doktor na mag-iisyu ng certificate na hindi naman sila magsisinungaling, dahil talaga namang mataas ang respeto natin sa ating mga doktor (There was a very heated discussion on the matter because some said when we allow those with comorbidities, many might cheat to get ahead in the line. But I said, let’s trust our doctors to issue the certificates. They will not lie because we really have high respect for our doctors),” he said over DZBB Sunday, Feb. 7.
Roque explained that persons with comorbidity such as diabetes and heart disease are among the priority recipients since they are vulnerable to contracting the new coronavirus disease.“Talagang ipinaglaban ko po iyan, kasi alam naman natin na sang-ayon sa siyensiya hindi lang matatanda ang vulnerable dito sa sakit na ito, eh kasama rin iyong mga may comorbidities (I really fought for that because we know that based on science, it is not just the old people who are vulnerable to the coronavirus illness. Those with comorbidities are also at risk),” he said.Frontline workers in health facilities and senior citizens will be the first and second recipients of the free vaccines from the government. The revised list of beneficiaries include frontline essential personnel such as uniformed forces, poor citizens, teachers and social workers, overseas Filipino workers, other workers, and the rest of the Filipino population.
Roque also said media workers are likely to be included in the priority group of essential workers.
He noted that the “economic frontliners” are those working in industries allowed to operate during the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). Media companies continued operations even though the government enforced a strict lockdown last year.“Iyong sinasabi ninyo siguro iyong mga economic frontliners, ito kasi iyong mga industriya na hindi sarado noong ECQ at kasama doon sa hindi sarado ay iyong mga news. ‘Di ba po, naalala ninyo ano, na maski ECQ kayo ay bukas? Ang basa ko po diyan, kasama sa listahan o pinayagang bukas habang mayroong ECQ ay kasama po doon sa magkakaroon ng prayoridad (You’re referring to the economic frontliners. These are the industries that did not shut down during ECQ and among them is the news. Do you remember that despite the ECQ, you were open? My These are the economic frontliners. I understand that those allowed to operate during ECQ will be include in the priority group),” he added.
More than a hundred million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been secured by the government in a bid to protect Filipinos from the deadly illness. So far, the Food and Drug Administration has given emergency use approval for vaccines developed Pfizer and AstraZeneca.
The government aims to inoculate around 70 million Filipinos to achieve herd immunity. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Panelo has urged Senate President Vicente Sotto III to sway his colleagues to join the information drive about the importance of vaccination to fight the new coronavirus disease.The latest appeal from the Palace official was made after a recent survey showed many Filipinos were reluctant to receive the coronavirus vaccine due to safety concerns.“Senate President Sotto, siguro magandang bulungan ninyo yung mga kasamahan sa Senado na sa halip na kung ano-ano ang kinakalaykay nila sa issue ng bakuna, ‘yun na lang. Concentrate na lang doon sa information campaign. Urge people the trust the bakuna (Senate President Sotto, maybe it would be good if you whisper into the ears of your Senate colleagues that instead of rummaging the issue of vaccines, just concentrate on the information campaign. Urge people to trust the vaccine),” he said during his “Counterpoint” program Saturday, Feb. 6.
“Let us educate our kababayans na huwag silang matakot sa pagbabakuna sapagkat hindi naman ito makakapinsala sa atin (Let us educate our fellow countrymen and tell them not to be afraid because it will not harm us),” he said.
The Senate recently conducted a hearing on the government’s vaccination program, grilling several administration officials involved in the procurement and distribution of the highly-anticipated drugs to prevent coronavirus.
Some lawmakers called on the government to reveal the vaccine prices but officials declined due to existing confidentiality pact with the suppliers.
President Duterte has vouched for the integrity of vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., and questioned critics for supposedly being preoccupied with the alleged corruption in the procurement of the vaccines.He insisted that Galvez does not hold the funds, adding any vaccine procurement will go through him and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III.
In the same commentary program, Panelo lamented that critics have not done nothing but find fault in the government’s efforts to address the pandemic, including its procurement of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines.
He said the government has also extended assistance to people severely affected by the pandemic and yet the critics have turned a blind eye on this endeavor.
“Kung kayo makapula, makapuna, maka-cirtaicize as if walang ginagawa ang adminsitrasyon Duterte (When you find fault, criticize, it’s as if the Duterte administration is not doing anything),” he said.
“Palibhasa kayo nakarente lang kayo diyan, pa-enjoy enjoy lang sa mga buhay ninyo. Ang expertise ninyo mamula, magpuna, mangbola, mang-intriga. Doon kayo magaling (Because you’re just enjoying your life, your expertise is to criticize, deceive and sow intrigues. That’s your expertise),” he added.
Panelo encouraged the critics to help with the vaccination campaign and instead of putting down the government.“Sama-sama na lang tayo. Iangat ang ating bansa. Tigilan na natin ‘yan. Sa halip na puna, ‘di sumama na lang kayo sa amin na bigyan wastong impormasyon ang ating mga kababayan kaugnay sa kahalagahan ng bakuna, na huwag silang matakot, at magtiwala sila(Let’s join hands and uplift our country. Let’s stop that. Instead of criticizing, join us in giving the right information to our people about the importance of vaccines, that they should not be afraid and instead trust them),” he said.He said the government, though the Presidential Communications Operations Office, also remains committed to educate the public about vaccination program.The PCOO, led by Secretary Martin Andanar, has already launched its “Explain, Explain, Explain” information drive, that includes town hall meetings, to help convince people to get inoculated against COVID-19.The government has secured over a hundred million doses of coronavirus vaccines to benefit all Filipino adults in the country.
Once the vaccines arrive in the country starting this month, health workers, seniors, poor and vulnerable citizens, essential workers, uniformed personnel are among the priority recipients of the vaccines.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Thus, said Department of Energy (DoE) Spokesperson Felix William Fuentebella on Sunday, February 7, in an interview over at DZBB radio.
“Sapat ang supply kasi natin. Unang-una, pumapatak ng lampas 30 percent yung sobrang power or reserba (Our supply is enough. First of all, our surplus or reserve power is over 30 percent),” he said.“Nag-aaverage tayo 37 percent sa Luzon; sa Visayas, 27 percent; sa Mindanao, almost 40 percent na nga eh. Pagdating sa summer, yung reserba medyo bumababa ng six, seven, eight percent, pero sobra pa rin siya (Our average surplus in Luzon is 37 percent; Visayas, 27 percent, in Mindanao, it’s actually almost 40 percent. Those figures go down to six, seven, eight percent during summer, but there’s still a surplus), he pointed out.
It has been widely reported that the COVID-19 vaccines need to be kept at a certain low temperature, or else they will spoil and essentially get wasted. This means that power outages have the potential to ruin everything.
Fuentebella said that this positive power outlook doesn’t even take into account the DoE’s three-tier back up plan, which is also meant to ensure continuous power supply in the coming months as authorities roll out its vaccination plan.
He explained last week the tiers of the power back up plan.“The first line would be coming from the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), the second from the Distribution Utilities, while the third and final back up would be the generators provided by the facility itself or the local government unit (LGU),” the DoE official said.
The Philippines is expecting the arrival of its supply of the vaccine from other countries later this month. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Award-winning actress Janine Gutierrez and the cast of the upcoming movie “Dito at Doon” are all excited for the rolling out of vaccines against COVID-19 here.
During a Zoom press conference, the stars and director of the new “hugot” flick have expressed willingness to receive a vaccine.“Yes! I’m really looking forward to it because it will be the start of more hopeful days after the pandemic. So when it’s available, pipila ako,” said Gutierrez.
JP Habac, director of the movie, said: “Ako sobra! Noong nag-two months na yung lockdown, ready na talaga ako sa vaccine. What more ngayon na mag-iisang taon na (under quarantine).”Incidentally, the movie, shot with lockdown in the background, will be shown on March 17, two days after the first year anniversary of quarantine in the Philippines.
Yesh Burce, who debuts in this film, said: “Yes! reading-ready na! Para masaya na tayong lahat uli!”“Yes ready na rin! Na mi miss ko na rin mag-cinema! Iba pa rin yung experience na malaki ‘yung (pinapanood na) screen. Tapos may mga physical strangers na kasama na nag-e-enjoy,” said Victor Anastacio.
JC Santos said: “Ready na ako (for a possible vaccine). I miss performing live. Lahat ng mga live theater, live musicians, nawawala. Gusto ko na rin manood ng premier night.”
Ting Nebrida, co executive producer of the romantic-comedy movie, said that TBA Studios is excited for its initial offering for 2021.
“We’re very excited. We think it’s the perfect time to start the year and it is set during the time of pandemic. It’s the kind of entertainment we’re looking for. It’s the kind of movie that TBA traditionally comes out with. It’s intelligent entertainment.
Nebrida admitted the movie was a big challenge to be shot during the pandemic.
Yesh Burce
“It is challenging but it can be done. There’s still TV shows to be produced and everything. Mabusisi lang but it can be done. We feel that we picked the right project – the right cast and the right director. We’ve worked with him na sa ‘I’m Drunk I Love You.’ We’re pleased with it,” he said.
Victor Anastacio
Habac said that he was both excited and nervous when he accepted the project.
“Kinakabahan ako kasi initially, it was intended to be shot online lang talaga, as in web cam lang talaga. But na challenge rin ako noong binabasa ko siya. Tapos with the new normal production na hindi nako-compromise yung story and at the same time bago siya sa mga mata ng manonood. Ang tagal nating na-lockdown so coming into this project, may halong excitement at kaba. I’m really happy I directed this project and masaya ako sa continued support ng TBA na pingakatiwalaan nila ako sa ganitong project given all the limitations,” he said.
The stars of the movie were under lockdown for 20 days when the movie was done. “We have to leave Metro Manila to shoot. So parang nasa isang bubble lang kami.”

Dr. Edsel Maurice T. SalvanaThe global push for safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 has led to a bumper crop of vaccine candidates. With over 200 COVID-19 vaccines in development and at least 10 vaccines completing or about to complete phase 3 clinical trials, which vaccine is the best?
In last week’s column, I emphasized that for those in imminent danger of severe COVID-19 should get vaccinated as soon as possible with whatever properly approved vaccine is available. This will be the case in the short term as global demand outstrips supply. As supply chains catch up and more vaccines are proven to work, we will get to the point where we can choose the most appropriate vaccine for each of us.

(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds)
COVID-19 vaccines fall under one of six categories. These are the categories.
a. Nucleic acid-based vaccines use viral genetic material, whether RNA or DNA. This includes the mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna.b. Inactivated virus vaccines use killed whole virus. This vaccine type includes Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines.c. Recombinant viral vectored vaccines use a harmless live virus as a carrier for the target virus’ genetic material to induce an immune response. Current COVID-19 vaccines using this technology use live but non-replicating carrier viruses like adenovirus 5 or adenovirus 26. Examples are vaccines from Astra, Cansino, J&J, and Gamaleya.d. Protein subunit vaccines use a piece of the virus, usually the spike protein, to generate an immune response.
e. Virus-like particle vaccines use artificial construct or structure that mimics real viruses and the body’s immune system responds accordingly.f. Live attenuated virus vaccines use a weakened form of the target virus to induce the immune response.Each of these categories come with advantages and disadvantages. Broadly speaking, only live attenuated viruses are able to reproduce. Recombinant viral vectors are alive, but are not able to reproduce. The rest of the vaccines are neither live nor able to replicate. These vaccine characteristics have important implications on the ability of the vaccine to produce robust immunity. This also impacts which patient populations can be safely inoculated with them.
Live replicating virus vaccines
Live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines are still in development and are not yet in clinical trials. This kind of vaccine is the most likely to be transmission-blocking because they mimic natural infection better than any of the other vaccines. These vaccines, however, are also the ones that can rarely inadvertently cause a form of the disease in susceptible hosts.
The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is an example of a live attenuated vaccine. OPV worked so well that natural polio infections were nearly eliminated. Once the level of natural polio infections drastically dropped due to the potency of OPV, the number of people who developed an atypical form of polio from the OPVoutnumbered the ones who actually got polio from natural infection. This is why in places where polio cases are low, the recommended polio vaccine is switched to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). This is because IPV does not have the danger of inadvertently causing an atypical form of polio and its main effect is to prevent the severe form of polio. IPV, however, does not block polio transmission. When there is a polio outbreak, live OPV is deployed to block transmission and extinguish the outbreak.
There is a lot of interest in live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines because these may be the ones that are more likely to generate herd immunity by being transmission blocking. They may also work better in children since kids have immature immune systems and may require a more robust active ingredient in a vaccine.Live non-replicating virus vaccineThe Astra, Cansino, J&J, and Gamaleya vaccines all use modified adenoviruses. These viruses are engineered to be unable to reproduce in humans but they contain part of the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or other viral parts. The adenovirus inserts the target genetic sequence into the host cell, which then makes virus parts that are recognized by the immune system. Using a live vector produces a whole gamut of immune responses, which may lead to more robust and longer-lasting protection.Using a non-replicating virus as a carrier is safer than a live attenuated virus because there is virtually no possibility of the carrier virus causing the actual disease. Live vaccines, however, even non-replicating ones should be used with caution among patients with weakened immune systems. These patients may not be able to overcome the live vaccines and may inadvertently develop disease if their body is unable to control even a weakened virus. Non-replicating viral vector vaccines are still relatively new, and so these should still be used with caution among people with diminished immune responses.Non-live non-replicating
The rest of the vaccine types are not live and are not replicating. These vaccines are considered safe even for people with underlying immune problems. One disadvantage is that some of these vaccines, such as the inactivated virus or protein subunit vaccines, may not induce as strong an immune response as the live vaccines.
Virus-like particles (VLPs) and mRNA vaccines address this problem using novel delivery mechanisms and innovative techniques. VLPs use recombinant technology and have been used in the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines against cervical cancer. These mimic real viruses by maximizing immune responses but eliminate the risk of using a live virus.
Nucleic acid-based vaccines like mRNA vaccines are not a new concept but the difficulty has been in ensuring that the nucleic acid molecules get into the cells intact. Once inside the cell, the body processes the mRNA into proteins and these proteins trigger the immune response. Our body makes millions of copies of proteins from our own mRNA, and the added protein production from an mRNA vaccine is a mere fraction of what the body handles in a day. The effectiveness of mRNA vaccines is from the large number of protein particles it generates. These proteins find their way into both the intracellular and extracellular compartments and induce a robust immune response. Allergic reactions that are seen in some people may be due to the novel lipid nanoparticle carriers used rather than the mRNA itself. These allergic reactions are being thoroughly investigated to identify any specific risks. Otherwise, mRNA vaccines are reasonably safe and effective.
The main advantage of using inactivated whole virus vaccines is that this is reasonably safe and proven technology.
These, however, may not induce as robust an immune response compared to live viruses. The ability to block transmission and mild disease may not be as high as that of live vaccines or mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the ability to prevent severe disease means that these vaccines may be best used for very frail people who need protection from severe disease but may not be able to tolerate live vaccines or the exuberant immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines. One other advantage of using the entire deactivated virus over using pieces or parts of it (VLPs, mRNA, protein subunit, recombinant vector) is that there is a large diversity of antigens available to induce an immune response. This large repertoire of antibodies may render the vaccine more resistant to escape mutations from the emerging new variants.
There remain a lot of unknowns on how the different types of vaccines work against COVID-19.
One of the most important questions is how long the protection will last. The longest amount of time that trial subjects have been observed from the early phase one trials is less than one year. We won’t know until after a year has passed whether these vaccines will need a booster later. The emergence of vaccine escape mutations is a concerning development. Vaccines can be “fixed,” however, by incorporating new sequences and new variants into the existing vaccines.
The plethora of vaccines being developed for COVID-19 can sometimes confuse people and make them more vaccine hesitant. At this time, there is no “best” vaccine and there is no “more appropriate” vaccine since we still have very little data. For the most at risk, especially frontliners and the elderly, the best vaccine is the vaccine you can get as soon as possible. When a vaccine is offered to you and you have questions, talk to your doctor about your risk and whether you can afford to wait or not. Don’t let fear or uncertainty take away our best shot at defeating COVID-19 once and for all. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

BEIJING — More than 31 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in China as of Feb. 3, according to China’s National Health Commission.
Preliminary tests showed that the incidence of severe abnormal reactions caused by the COVID-19 vaccines currently used in China is no higher than that of the influenza vaccine, said Xu Wenbo, head of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention under the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
In late December 2020, an inactivated vaccine developed by Beijing Biological Products Institute Co., Ltd. under the China National Biotec Group (CNBG), affiliated with Sinopharm, became the first to receive conditional market approval from the National Medical Products Administration.

The survey which aims to know the residents’ opinion on the planned COVID-19 vaccine rollout of the city also found that Muntinlupa residents’ top choice of vaccine is Pfizer-BioNTech.
The latest results of the ongoing COVID-19 vaccine survey as of Feb. 5 showed that out of the 4,074 respondents from Muntinlupa’s nine barangays, 63 percent or 2,567 individuals said they are willing to get vaccinated, an increase from 54 percent in the last survey dated Jan. 18.A total of 788 respondents or 19.34 percent said “no,” and 719 or 17.65 percent did not answer and were classified as “unaccounted.”
The city government has been implementing a sustained information campaign to explain the importance of the vaccine to the public.
Of the 2,567 residents who agreed to be vaccinated, 1,220 or 47.5 percent chose the Pfizer-BioNTech as their preferred vaccine followed by AstraZeneca with 894 (34.82 percent), Moderna with 63 (2.45 percent), Sinovac with 56 (2.18 percent), other vaccine with 30 (1.16 percent), Sputnik V with 13 (0.5 percent) and 314 (12.23 percent) said any of the vaccines from AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac, and Sputnik V. Some respondents answered more than one vaccine resulting in the total exceeding the number of respondents.
Out of the 788 individuals who said “no” to vaccination, 590 chose “side effects that may be experienced” as their number one reason for not getting a vaccine, followed by “doubtful with the efficiency rate of the vaccine,” 441; “fee of vaccination,” 191; “conflict with current health condition,” 146; and “others,” five. Some of the respondents had multiple answers resulting in the total exceeding the number of respondents.Out of the 4,074 respondents, 2,450 (60.1 percent) were female, 1,563 (38.4 percent) were male, and 61 (1.5 percent) did not reveal their gender.

The national government is set to receive around 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines from the United States anytime this month, its first batch of COVID-19 vaccine since the pandemic began in the country last year.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said the Pfizer vaccines were secured through the country’s participation in the Covax facility, a global initiative for the development and equal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Gavi vaccine alliance.“These 117,000 doses are dedicated for our healthcare workers to protect those who are in the frontlines of the fight,” he said during the Coordinated Operations to Defeat Epidemic (CODE) Team’s visit in Paranaque City.Further, Galvez revealed that around 9.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines from the United Kingdom are also set to be delivered by March or April.
The National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19, where Galvez also serves as its chief implementer, will also team up with the Department of Health to request an additional 900,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines from the Covax facility.
“We already requested a meeting with the DOH to make the request. We really hope the additional Pfizer doses will be granted for our health care workers,” Galvez said.
Meanwhile, Galvez urged local government units (LGUs) to treat the vaccines as “precious gold” since not all developing countries are lucky to secure them in the early part of 2021.“Ang bakuna natin ay parang ginto (Our vaccines are like gold). Precious ito (These are very precious). We were really nervous because we saw that only 20 percent of the global supply remained for the first and second quarter. We are happy that the WHO and Gavi managed to secure vaccines for our needs,” Galvez said.
During the visit, Galvez also led the ocular inspection of the cold storage facility of Royal Cargo, Inc., a logistics provider which has expanded its facilities to cater to the temperatures required for the storage of different COVID-19 vaccines.
He expressed confidence that local government units (LGUs), particularly in Metro Manila, will be able to handle the storage of the COVID-19 vaccines once they start arriving in bulks.At present, Galvez said 53 to 60 countries were able to roll out 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines around the world.
Of the 100 million doses used, around 70 percent were secured by four rich countries particularly the United States, China, and two European countries.
“There’s a disparity in equality sa access sa mga vaccine (to the vaccines). Nagpapasalamat kami sa WHO na kahit kokonti, at least malaki ang maitutulong noon sa atin (We thank the WHO for the limited supply which will be a big help to us),” Galvez said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sorry kids, the COVID-19 vaccine is not for you – yet.
While the country is getting ready to implement its COVID-19 vaccination program, Dr. Leonila Dans, a clinical epidemiologist and pediatrician at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), said that children are not yet included in the vaccination schedule.
(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)In a webinar entitled, “Who Should Not be Vaccinated for COVID-19?” organized by the by the University of the Philippines (UP) in partnership with the National Telehealth Center on Friday, Feb. 5, Dans emphasized that children should not be included in any COVID-19 vaccination initiatives because there is “no vaccine” that has been developed for the younger age group to date.
“At this point, children are not yet included among those who will receive the vaccine,” Dans said. “This is because when we do administer or grade the evidence, we depend a lot on the clinical trials that were performed for the new drugs or the vaccines that are being in question or being evaluated,” she added.
So far, Dans said that only one vaccine, Pfizer, has included older adolescents or 16 years old and above in their clinical trials. “At this point, only this vaccine might be used in older children,” she explained.
However, Dans reminded that for younger children or those 16 years old and below – especially for other vaccines that started 18 years and above for their clinical trials – vaccination is “definitely not yet allowed” at this time.
“It’s not because we don’t want to include them, it’s just because the vaccine for them is still being studied,” Dans said. “The use of vaccines in the younger age group is still being studied and eventually, maybe the children will still be vaccinated with this new vaccine,” she added.
Dans also discussed that should children be allowed to get vaccinated for COVID-19 in the future, there will also be special considerations during routine immunizations.
For instance, Dans said that caution should be observed when administering COVID-19 for children with severe allergies or history of anaphylaxis, those with bleeding disorders, and for immunocompromised children or those on immunosuppressants. “You have to discuss this with your physicians even when your children are receiving routine immunizations – especially for COVID-19 vaccines,” she added.
Dans said that parents should also consider delaying – for two weeks or up to one month – availing of vaccines for children who have “received immunoglobulins or blood products or those with severe illnesses.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Dr. Shelley Ann Dela Vega, the Director at the Institute on Aging, National Institute of Health in the University of the Philippines (UP) Manila, discussed this in a webinar entitled, “Who Should Not Be Vaccinated for COVID-19?” on Friday, Feb. 5.
Her presentation focused on the importance of having older people vaccinated to stop COVID deaths. “Older people are the best candidates for COVID vaccination especially because many have chronic diseases that predispose them to complications in death,” Dela Vega said.Citing studies, Dela Vega explained that “most deaths are among older persons” both in the country and worldwide. Globally, she noted that for people 50 to 80 years old, the death rate is between 0.4 to 20.2 percent. In the Philippines, most deaths are people from 65 years and older with 81.5 percent.
Aside from age, Dela Vega noted that older people are at risk of severe COVID because there are morbidities of chronic diseases that “predispose older persons to mortality, hospitalization, and other complications” such as hypertension, diabetes, cancers, and obesity – among others.
Given this, Dela Vega urged older people to “get listed and be vaccinated” especially if they have one or more chronic and degenerative disease.
Dela Vega noted that one of the most common concerns of the people – in general – on getting vaccinated for COVID-19 is safety. Thus, she reassured them that “COVID-19 vaccines are generally safe.” She added that “only the most effective vaccine brand will be recommended” for them.On the other hand, Dela Vega explained that frailest and near the end of life may also “receive the vaccine especially in nursing homes where strict infection control is necessary.”
Dela Vega also recommended close monitoring and “tender loving care” from caregivers and family members to be ensured for the frailest purse and persons with dementia. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Citing discussions with the Department of Health (DOH), Briones noted that “teachers can help inform learners on the overview of the national government’s vaccine program.”On using schools as vaccination centers, Briones stressed that it will be a case-to-case basis since not all schools are equipped with spaces and equipment for the program.
Currently, Briones reminded that schools act as distribution sites for learning packets and Self-Learning Modules.

North Korea has requested Covid-19 vaccines and is expected to receive nearly two million doses, according to the Gavi vaccine alliance, part of the WHO-backed Covax program, although the isolated country has insisted it is virus-free.
North Korea insists it has not had a single case of the coronavirus but experts say that is unlikely, given the virus first emerged in neighboring China, its main provider of trade and aid (KIM Won Jin AFP/File / MANILA BULLETIN)
It is the first official confirmation that the North has asked for international help, with the country’s medical infrastructure is seen as woefully inadequate for dealing with any large-scale outbreak.
The Covax scheme, co-led by the Gavi alliance, will distribute 1.99 million doses to the North, according to Covax’s interim distribution report released this week.All countries receiving interim allocations of vaccines “have submitted requests for vaccines”, a Gavi spokesman told AFP on Thursday.
The allocations cited in the report “reflect latest estimates of supply and take into account country readiness and regulatory approvals,” he added.
According to the report, the North is to receive the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab produced by the Serum Institute of India.
Pyongyang closed its borders in late January last year — the first country in the world to do so — in a bid to protect itself against the coronavirus.It has long insisted that it has had no cases, with its leader Kim Jong Un reiterating the claim at a huge military parade in October.

The process could take several weeks, but at the end of it the vaccine would be the third authorized in the United States, after those of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
J&J subsidiary Janssen Biotech “has submitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its investigational single-dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate,” the statement read.The new vaccine is highly anticipated because it has two big logistical advantages: it can be stored at refrigerator temperatures rather than in special freezers, significantly easing distribution; and it requires just one dose.
Following J&J’s request, the FDA is expected to convene its advisory committee on vaccines, which will deliver its opinion after studying the data from clinical trials.
It will be responsible for determining whether the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.
That step took about three weeks for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, but could be faster this time around. The final green light will then be given, probably the next day.J&J announced at the end of last week the first results of its clinical trials, carried out on nearly 44,000 people in eight countries.
The vaccine was overall 66 percent effective, the company said. And it is 85 percent effective in preventing severe forms of the disease.
But these results also raised a concern: the shot was more effective in the United States (72 percent), than in South Africa (57 percent), where a variant that had appeared in the country has now became dominant. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“We will mobilize our entire bureaucracy, the local government units (LGUs), private sector, socio-civic organizations, non-government organizations, and volunteer groups,” said Defensor.The 47-page document is the framework for the vaccination plan that would be undertaken by LGUs and the private sector in the province’s 42 towns and the component city of Passi.
It was created with inputs from the Iloilo Provincial Health Office, Iloilo Hospital Management Office and reviewed by the Department of Health (DOH).
The vaccine plan has outlined key aspects of the program including prioritization of who gets to be vaccinates; cold storage facilities for the vaccine once it arrives; vaccination sites; human resources; and other logistical requirements.
The Iloilo provincial government has allocated an initial P95 million for vaccine procurement. It has made reservations when it signed a multilateral agreement with British pharmaceutical firm AztraZeneca and the national government.The provincial government will acquire an initial 271,000 doses of AztraZeneca AZD1222 vaccines.

Former Health Secretary Dr. Esperanza Cabral urged the public to listen to medical experts and “not be discouraged” in taking the COVID-19 vaccine just because of the Dengvaxia vaccine controversy. Former Health Secretary Dr. Esperanza Cabral (UP.EDU)
The Department of Health (DOH) previously said that the controversy regarding the anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia has “caused hesitancy” in the country’s vaccination program.
Cabral said that the public should trust science. “Wala pa rin tayong sasandigan kung hindi siyensa pa rin (We have nothing to rely on but science),” she explained.
The former DOH chief said that the Dengvaxia issue was “sensationalized” and had many “false narratives.”
“Talagang masyado lamang na sensationalize ang issue, maraming false narratives na lumabas tungkol sa mga scientists…Nabastos masyado ang mga scientists at nawalan tuloy ng kumpyansa sa kanila ang mga tao (The issue was sensationalized, a lot of false narratives had came out about scientists… Scientists were insulted too much and the people have lost confidence in them),” said Cabral.
“Ang Dengvaxia vaccine, ito ay isa sa mga bakuna na mas mahigit pa ang pag-aaral kesa sa mga COVID vaccines… Pilipinas lamang ang hindi gumagamit ng Dengvaxia. Lahat ng ibang bansa na may dengue virus ay gumagamit ng Dengvaxia at hindi totoo na ito ay nakakamatay (The Dengvaxia vaccine was studied longer compared to COVID vaccines. Only the Philippines does not use Dengvaxia. All other countries with dengue virus use Dengvaxia and it is not true that it causes death),” she said.
Cabral said that medical professionals have the ability to convince people in taking the COVID-19 vaccine.“Our healthcare providers will be playing a major role in the information campaign because they are the ones most trusted by the people when they deliver health information,” she stressed.
“I think they will believe the healthcare providers more than they will believe politicians or attorneys or things like those,” she added.
Case update
Meanwhile, the DOH recorded 1,590 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, Feb. 4, pushing the nationwide count to 531,699.
The case bulletin also showed that 249 patients recovered, bringing the recoveries to 487,927. Fifty-five fatalities were also recorded, taking the death toll to 10,997.
“Nine duplicates were removed from the total case count, Of these, two were recovered cases,” the DOH said.
“Moreover, 41 cases that were previously tagged as recovered were reclassified as deaths after final validation,” it added.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WHO Country Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe on Thursday said that 9.2 million doses out of the 44 million doses are expected to arrive in the country within the first and second quarter of this year.
Abeyansinghe said that the delivery of vaccines will start “once the Philippine government fulfills the necessary arrangements needed by the COVAX to ensure smooth vaccine rollout and other requirements of the vaccine manufacturers Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals.”“When all of those requirements are met and we believe that the Philippines is on track to do that, we are looking potentially at a maximum of 9.2 million doses coming through the COVAX facility by March or April of this year,” said Abeyansinghe in a statement.
“We are optimistic that the remainder of the 44 million doses will come later on in the year,” he added.
To note, the COVAX facility is a global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to coronavirus vaccines for all countries.
“The goal of COVAX is to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world to minimize the impact of the pandemic, to save lives, and to facilitate quick economic recovery,” said Abeyasinghe.Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III assured that cold chain facilities in the country are now ready to store COVID-19 vaccines.
“We have been implementing immunization for decades already, and most of these vaccines that are forthcoming would be currently for the logistical side 2 to 8 degrees. We already have these kinds of facilities and equipment,” he said.
“With these ultra-low freezers, we have end-to-end agreements with manufacturers where they will assist us from the time that the vaccines arrive here to the storage and the distribution,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra (TOTO LOZANO/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO /MANILA BULLETIN)
Guevarra pointed this out as the NBI has been conducting an investigation on the unauthorized entry and use of COVID-19 vaccines in the country.
“I suppose that in the investigation being conducted by the NBI on the alleged entry and distribution of unregistered COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines, the possible existence of fake vaccines among those being sold underground is included,” the secretary said.Guevarra himself gave the directive to the NBI to conduct the investigation.
However, he said, he has yet to receive a latest report from the NBI on the investigation it is conducting.
In Department Order No. 314 issued last Jan. 1, the secretary instructed the NBI“to conduct an investigation on the reported importation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, administration, and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines that are not authorized by or registered with the Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines, and, if evidence warrants, to file the appropriate charges against all persons involved and found responsible for any unlawful act in connection therewith.”
The secretary issued the order following revelations made by Presidential Security Group (PSG) commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III that the PSG was able to get COVID-19 vaccines and have its personnel vaccinated to better protect Duterte from getting infected with the virus.But Guevarra had already clarified that his order for the NBI to conduct the investigation was not prompted by the reports on the vaccination conducted on PSG security personnel.

GENEVA, Switzerland (Xinhua) — COVAX, the initiative led by the World Health Organization (WHO) for equitable global access to the COVID-19 vaccines, on Wednesday said it has allocated a total of 337 million doses of vaccines for poorer countries so far and will aim to deliver these in the first half of 2021.
In an interim distribution forecast, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Vaccine Alliance Gavi and the WHO said the allocation would cover an average of 3.3 percent of the total population of over 140 countries taking part in the initial delivery round.
However, COVAX also warned of various caveats, such as delays in the WHO’s Emergency Use Listing Procedure (EUL), disruptions in supply chains and logistics bottlenecks.South Africa, Cap Verde and Rwanda are expected to be among the first countries in Africa to get the shots.

Oxford University announced on Thursday it will launch a medical trial alternating doses of Covid-19 vaccines created by different manufacturers, the first study of its kind.
The trial will show whether different Covid doses — those created by the Astrazeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech pharmaceutical companies — can be used interchangeably to allow greater flexibility in pressured vaccine delivery schedules.
The British government’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said the trial would offer “greater insight” into the use of vaccines against Covid.“Given the inevitable challenges of immunising large numbers of the population against Covid-19 and potential global supply constraints, there are definite advantages to having data that could support a more flexible immunisation programme,” Van-Tam said.
“It is also even possible that by combining vaccines, the immune response could be enhanced giving even higher antibody levels that last longer,” he added.
The 13-month study will compare different combinations of prime and booster doses of the Astrazeneca and Pfizer vaccines at intervals of four and 12 weeks.
Britain, the first western nation to launch its vaccination programme, has bucked the international trend by administering vaccines at an interval of 12 weeks in a bid to give a first dose of the vaccine to more individuals.Professor Matthew Snape from Oxford University called the study “extremely exciting”, adding that it would provide “information vital to the roll out of vaccines in the UK and globally”.If the study shows positive results, Britain’s independent medicines regulator would formally assess the safety and efficacy of any new vaccination regimen before it is rolled out to patients. Disagreements between the UK and the European Union over vaccine supplies have boiled over in recent weeks with Brussels moving to restrict vaccine exports to Northern Ireland on Thursday before the plans were abandoned in a swift U-turn.In the following days, EU member states and the European Commission have continued to criticise the English-Swedish drugs manufacturer AstraZeneca over slow vaccine delivery and the efficacy of the jab has also been called into question.On Wednesday, the British government seized on a separate study that said the AstraZeneca vaccine — which was developed in partnership with Oxford University — significantly reduces virus transmission and is highly protective after a single dose.
AstraZeneca and Oxford University said on Wednesday vaccines against new developing coronavirus variants should be ready by October. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

For the second quarter, we expect other orders from the private sector and government procurement),” he said.
The senator from Davao pointed out that the huge demand for vaccines amid limited supply has become a challenge for the whole world.

“Nag-order ako, kung pwede, sa malalaking kumpanya katulad nitong (Astra) Zeneca, two million (doses) and Moderna, 200,000 (doses). (I have ordered, if it is allowed, from big companies like AstraZeneca, two million (doses) and Moderna, 200,000 doses),” Gordon said.“May kakausapin pa kami ngayon na pagkukuhaan ng another 200,000 (doses). May mga kakausapin din kami na ibang tao. (We are still negotiating with other companies to procure another 200,000 doses. We will also talk to other people),” he added.
Gordon also reiterated his proposal to implement the “Buy One, Donate One” scheme, where those who have the capacity to buy the vaccine can also donate to those who cannot afford it.
“May mga kinakausap na kaming mga tao na can afford na magbibigay sya ng libre sa mahirap para makapagbakuna. (We are already talking to people who can afford to buy and donate vaccine to the poor),” he said.
While the PRC is still working on getting COVID-19 vaccines, Gordon offered its assistance to the Department of Health in its national immunization program. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

An online survey conducted by a team of researchers from the University of Santo Tomas (UST) has shown that only 56 percent of Filipinos were willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
The UST-CoVAX Vaccine Awareness Team, led by Fr. Nicanor Austriaco, surveyed about 15,600 respondents in January to find out the beliefs and perceptions of the Filipino people regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.
(JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Of the 56 percent who said they are willing to be vaccinated, 24 percent answered “definitely yes,” while 32 percent said “probably yes.”
ADVERTISINGMeanwhile, about 10 percent said they were not willing to be vaccinated, composed of 3.5 percent saying “definitely no” and 6.7 percent saying “probably no.”
Thirty-four percent of the respondents were “unsure” whether they want to receive a vaccine or not.
In a DZMM Teleradyo interview, Austriaco pointed out that those who said they were unsure, where either nervous or scared to get inoculated against COVID-19.
He underscored the government’s role to convince Filipinos that getting inoculated is safe.“Remember, we have to vaccinate 100 percent of Filipinos to end this pandemic. Fifty percent is not good enough. We have to work to convince more of them to want to be vaccinated. Our survey showed that many are scared about the vaccine and its safety. They are worried that it will not work or make them sick. They are worried about fake vaccines. There are many worries so the government has to reassure us all that the worries are not real. That they are worth the risk for our families,” he explained.
“I am hoping that the DOH in its public awareness campaign will help provide information for that. So my team at UST-COVAX, we are already preparing public awareness campaign,” he added.
Austriaco said he is currently in the United States where he got in touch with Filipino frontliners in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut who have been already vaccinated.“I am asking them to help explain to the Filipinos, to their kababayans (countrymen) back in the Philippines that it was okay. We are getting testimonies from OFWs and overseas Filipinos who have been vaccinated to explain what it was like to be vaccinated,” he said.
Austriaco said he already had his first dose of Moderna vaccine. “The day after I slept all day and I had chills for 30 minutes but that was it,” he pointed.
Also in the UST-CoVAX online survey, 50.9 percent of Filipinos said they have no specific preference about which coronavirus vaccine they will take.
“We asked them, do you prefer the Chinese, Russian, or European/Western?,” Austriaco said.
“Basically, 1 percent preferred Chinese, 2.3 percent preferred Russian, 45.7 percent preferred from US or Europe, and 50.9 percent have no preferrence (they will take anything safe and effective),” he said.

American firm Novavax will become the first to manufacture a Covid-19 vaccine in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday, but it will only start supplying doses at the end of a planned domestic rollout.
(AFP FILE/ MANILA BULLETIN)
The announcement comes as Ottawa grapples with delays in deliveries of doses sourced from Europe.
Canada has contracted with Novavax for up to 76 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, but its health regulator has yet to approve its use.“Canada will now be well-placed to produce vaccines for Canadians at home, and in the best case scenario if we don’t need it here in Canada, we will be able to offer doses to our allies or partners in developing countries around the world because this pandemic won’t be over until everyone has been vaccinated,” Trudeau told a news conference.
The Canadian government and Novavax, the prime minister said, signed a memorandum of understanding to set up new production in Montreal.The company said its vaccine, which requires two doses, has proven to be 89.3 percent effective in clinical trials.
Construction of the National Research Council’s Biologics Manufacturing Centre that will house Novavax’s vaccine production is already underway, and is expected to be completed in July.It will be capable of producing two million doses per month.
The government also announced an agreement with Vancouver-based Precision NanoSystems to build a biomanufacturing centre to make up to 240 million doses of RNA Covid-19 vaccines per year. It is targeted for completion in March 2023.
Trudeau has said that most Canadians would be inoculated against the coronavirus by September.But recent deliveries of the first two vaccines to get regulatory approval in December — made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna at plants in Europe — have been delayed by several weeks.
So far, according to the latest government figures, almost one million Canadians have received a first of two required doses of these two vaccines. Less than 120,000 have received both shots needed for immunity, said public broadcaster CBC.
Trudeau has reassured that the delays are only temporary and that the country’s largest ever inoculation program would be back on track by March.
Hedging bets, Canada has placed orders and secured options for more than 400 million doses of vaccines from seven pharmaceutical firms, for its population of 38 million.
As of Tuesday, Canada reported more than 780,000 cases of Covid-19 illness and 20,000 deaths. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The upcoming vaccination program can “save lives” and “revive hopes” amid these trying times, according to Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Secretary Martin Andanar.
PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar (PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Andanar highlighted on Tuesday the benefits of the government’s immunization drive as part of PCOO’s intensified campaign to convince more Filipinos to get vaccinated.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III earlier asked the PCOO to step up efforts to inform the people about the vaccines and dispel fake news about these products. Sotto claimed that many people were scared to get inoculated due to speculations that such vaccines were supposedly not safe and ineffective.In a statement, Andanar said the PCOO would continue to “educate and enlighten” the public about the immunization drive through traditional and social media and counter the disinformation about such vaccines.“We want to deliver to them the message that the vaccination program can save lives, revive hopes, and shape our collective future as a nation,” he said.
“We will continue our intensified communications and information campaigns in order to inform every Filipino and assist the national government in the rollout and implementation of our national vaccination program so that we can heal, recover, and rise as one nation,” he said.
Andanar said he sympathized with Sotto’s statement about the apprehension among some Filipinos to receive coronavirus vaccines. He recognized that the lack of understanding about the vaccines remained “a widespread problem.”“This gets further complicated with misinformation and disinformation by some individuals and groups who claim that vaccination is not an ideal and safe option for virus immunization,” he said.
He said the PCOO would help bring “knowledge and clarity” about the vaccines through its programs such as the “Laging Handa” activities, town hall meetings, and media literacy training.
“As the lead communications arm of the Duterte administration, we in the PCOO have been undertaking communications and information campaigns not only on the COVID-19 pandemic, but also on the upcoming rollout of our national vaccination program,” he said.A Pulse Asia survey recently showed that nearly half of Filipinos are unwilling to be vaccinated due to safety concerns. In the survey conduced last November, 47 percent of the 2,400 respondents said they do not want to vaccinated, 32 percent are willing, and 21 percent are undecided.Safety concern is the top reason given by respondents who are reluctant to receive the vaccines.
The Philippines plans to secure 178 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines enough to inoculate 92 million people, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez recently said. The figure is more than the target of 148 million doses this year in anticipation of the delays in the delivery of the supplies, Dominguez said. The government has set aside $1.38 billion in funding from multilateral agencies to bankroll the vaccine procurement.An initial 3 million doses are expected to arrive this month while the bulk of the supply will be delivered third and fourth quarters of the year.

A Filipino-American molecular biologist and priest is looking into the development of a yeast-based COVID-19 vaccine to offer a cheaper alternative for the Filipinos.
Rev. Fr. Nicanor Pier Giorgo Austriaco (CBHD)
Rev. Fr. Nicanor Pier Giorgo Austriaco, O.PPh.D., S. Th. D., who is currently a visiting professor of Biological Sciences at the University of the Santo Tomas (UST), confirmed that he is working on a COVID-19 vaccine that is yeast-based.
“We are working on a yeast-based oral vaccine for Filipinos that will be cheaper and can be transported without refrigeration,” Austriaco said in a presentation during the 121st Plenary Assembly of Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) held last week.Austriaco, who is also a professor of Biology and of Theology, started to bring his molecular biology expertise into the Philippines’ fight against COVID-19 in 2020. As a fellow of the OCTA Research team, he is also very much involved in pandemic management for the country.
In his presentation entitled, “The Science and Ethics of COVID-19 Vaccines,” Austriaco, discussed how COVID-19 vaccines work, which vaccines will be available in the Philippines and when will these arrive in the country.
He also discussed “ethical consideration” to clarify misconceptions on the COVID-19 vaccines that are currently developed.
“The key message here is antibodies destroy SARS-CoV2,” Austriaco explained.“The reason why the pandemic was so devastating around the world – with 100 million have been affected by SARS-CoV2 in less than a year – is because no one has any antibodies against SARS-CoV2,” he added.
For the Philippines, Austriaco vaccines are expected to from the West including Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca; the Gamelaya from Russia; and the Sinovac and Sinopharm from China.
Austriaco also discussed the challenges in the different vaccines – including storage issues and efficacy – among others. Some vaccines need freezers such as Pfizer while others such as Gamelayaa nd AstraZeneca can be stored in regular fridge temperatures.When it comes to efficacy, he noted that Moderna, Pfizer, and Russian vaccines are “relatively good.” AstraZeneca’s efficacy, he added, ranges from 60 to 90 percent. “The standard approved protocols for the UK is 62 percent – this is what we would be expecting to use in the Philippines,” he added. The Chinese vaccines, on the other hand, have 78 to 91% and can be “kept in the refrigerators that are usually used at home.”
Austriaco also touched on ethical considerations in the vaccines – noting that some vaccines used cells obtained from the remains of an “aborted female fetus” in 1973.“What is clear is that we will not be morally-compromised if we choose vaccines that were made using these cells because there were no actual parts used, none of these are injected into you because they were all destroyed in the process of making the vaccine,” he explained.
Enormous challenges of the vaccination
As the country prepares for the roll out of its COVID-19 mass vaccination program, Austriaco pointed out some of the challenges in its implementation.“It will be the largest and most complex public health effort in the history of the Philippines and will especially benefit the poor and most vulnerable among us,” Austriaco said.
He also pointed out that there will be a need to vaccinate at least 75 million people – every single Filipino adult – scattered over our 7,000 plus islands. “It is such a big logistical problem and a critical problem for the country,” he said. “We will have to vaccinate most of them twice within a month,” he added.
Austriaco also discussed vaccine hesitancy among Filipinos.
“It is heart-breaking to talk about vaccines but it is also important for them to be vaccinated,” he said.“The goal of the vaccination program is not to prevent COVID-19 but to prevent severe COVID-19 that will kill you,” Austriaco said. “If we do not vaccinate the adults, the pandemic will not end and we will have lockdowns every three months in order to keep this under control,” he added.
As part of his recommendations, Austriaco requested the Bishops of the Philippines consider “adding intention to the oratio imperata for COVID-19 to beg God to bless our country’s vaccination efforts to end the pandemic.”
He requested bishops to consider being vaccinated on TV alongside mayors of the local governments to “encourage our Filipino people, especially our poorest people, to be vaccinated.”
To help the country in ending the pandemic, Austriaco asked for the help of the Church.
“It is very important for the Church to help the country fight this pandemic, otherwise, it will not end,” he ended. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

He particularly said that the information drive should put emphasis on the advantages of the inoculation and the risks of not getting the vaccines. He also asked the government to prioritize urban poor communities and far-flung municipalities, “where information are muddled by scary stories of bad side effects and even deaths in a post-vaccination scenario.”
“Maraming natatakot na magpa-bakuna dahil sa mga nagkalat na haka-haka at mga balitang nagsasabi na hindi naman ito epektibo laban sa COVID-19. Maliban pa rito,hindi rin malinaw sa publiko ang magiging sistema sa pagba-bakuna. Hangga’t malabo sa isipan ng tao kung ano ang magandang maidudulot ng bakuna sa kanilang kalusugan ay mahihirapan talaga ang pamahalaan na kumbinsihin sila na makiisa sa programang ito,” Sotto said in a statement(Many are scared to get vaccinated because there are rumors and reports that vaccines are not effective against COVID-19. Besides this, it is not clear yet to the public how the vaccination will be implemented. Until the people understand the benefits of the vaccination, the government will really have a hard time to convince them to participate in this program.)
“Alam naman natin ang impact ng tsismis at fake news lalo na sa ating mga kababayan na nakatira sa mga malalayong komunidad. Mahalagang maayos na maipaliwanag ng gobyerno na hindi makakasama sa kanila ang pagpapa-bakuna, kundi ay makakatulong ito para maproteksyunan sila laban sa COVID-19,” he added.
(We all know the impact of the rumors and fake news especially on those residing in far-flung communities. It’s important for the government to explain that the vaccination will not harm them, and will help protect them against COVID-19.)
Sotto said the Presidential Communications Operations Office “must double their efforts in both mainstream and social media”.He said local government units could also be tapped to implement the information drive since they are familiar with their with their jurisdiction’s population profile and geography.Medical personnel should likewise be included in the campaign due to their expertise on health, he said.
A survey conducted by OCTA Research last month showed that only one in four Metro Manila residents are willing to be inoculated against COVID-19, while 75 percent are either undecided or unwilling.The government plans to vaccinate 50-70 million Filipino this year under its immunization program, which was set to start late February.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines are now being sold to the “highest bidder”, leaving poor countries like the Philippines scrambling for the remaining supply.

(RICHARD MADELO / PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
According to the President, the country’s “greatest disadvantage” was being poor, but his government was able to allocate funds to secure vaccines for majority of Filipinos.“Alam mo ho itong problema talaga ng COVID hindi ganoon kadali. For one, ang greatest disadvantage natin is hindi tayo mayaman at ito labanan ito ngayon sa highest bidder nga (You the problem with COVID is it’s not that easy. For one, our greatest disadvantage is we are not rich and it is now a fight for the highest bidder),” Duterte said.
“Kung sino ‘yung makabayad ng una, mag-deposito na, tapos lalo na kung ‘yung bansa na ‘yon ang humihingi ng supply ng vaccine is the country where the factory is located — tawagin natin factory — nandiyan, nauuna talaga sa kanila (Whoever can pay first, make a deposit, especially if the country seeking the vaccine supply is the country where the factor is located, they really get ahead of the line),” he added.
As countries go on buying sprees for the most promising COVID vaccines, the President was optimistic that the cost of these vaccines will eventually stabilize.“Iyong mga price-price haggling lang ‘yan eventually ‘yung mag-taper off ‘yan into a uniformity sa prices (The price haggling will eventually taper off into a uniformity of prices),” he said.Duterte also told the nation “not to worry” about the vaccination program, saying the government, through vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., continues to negotiate for ample vaccines from suppliers.He also said the government has secured funds for vaccine procurement, citing the financial aid from multilateral lenders such as World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
Any financial transaction related to the vaccine purchase must still pass the scrutiny of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, he added.“Huwag ho kayong maniwala, just stick with General Galvez. Huwag na kayong — huwag kayong lumipas sa kanya or ignore him and believe the others (Do not worry, just stick with General Galvez. Do not ignore him and believe the others),” he said.
“Mayroon tayong pangbayad. Ang Asian Development Bank pati ang World Bank magpahiram sa atin para ibayad natin sa vaccine na bilhin natin (We have money to buy. The Asian Development Bank and World Bank have lent us money to procure vaccines),” he added.
The government has decided to buy more vaccine supplies of the vaccines to cover more than 90 million Filipinos, anticipating the delays in the manufacturing and delivery of the drugs.
Dominguez, in the same meeting with the President, said the government intends to secure 178 million doses of coronavirus for 92 million Filipinos, more than the original target of 148 million doses for 70 million people.
The country’s vaccine supplies will be sourced from AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Novavax, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Sinovac.So far, Galvez said the government has locked in 108 million vaccine doses from various suppliers abroad. The supply agreements are expected to be finalized next week.An initial shipment of around 3 million doses of vaccines are expected to arrive in the country this month, Galvez said.Among the priority recipients of the government’s free inoculations are medical frontliners, seniors, poor citizens, and the uniformed personnel.

During President Duterte’s televised weekly address to the public, the official said that the recommendation came from the Metro Manila mayors.
“And we are recommending in the second quarter, sir (referring to President Duterte), we should include in our (priority list), our recommendation: the protection of priority sectors, institutions. These include, sir, the economic frontliners,” Galvez said.“This is the recommendation of our (Metro) Manila mayors because we can see as you say, the drivers in food and industries, in the services—the social services, at the same time the life support services, need to protect them.”
The official noted that these groups come also from the impoverished sector of society, and that the local government units are pushing for their inclusion in the government’s priority list once the rollout of the vaccine starts.
Galvez clarified that the health care workers will still be the first in the priority list as they are the most vulnerable to the vaccine.
“They will also lead the government’s vaccination program, so they should be protected from the virus or else “our healthcare system will collapse,” he said.The government’s order of priority in the vaccination plan are frontline health care workers, senior citizens, indigent population, uniformed personnel, and other vulnerable groups.
The first tranche of the vaccines, believed to be China’s Sinovac, is scheduled to arrive in February.
Galvez said the “full rollout” of the vaccines will arrive in the third and fourth quarters of this year. But in the second quarter, the official added that they are pushing manufacturers, specifically Novavax and AstraZeneca, to deliver vaccine doses.The government is planning to purchase around 148 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines from various manufacturers for the inoculation of some 70 million Filipinos this year.

The first set of data was available on the website of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), covering the 27-nation bloc plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
However it was still incomplete on Monday, as some countries had yet to report their national data. Member states are expected to report their numbers twice a week.As a result, the tracker indicated the number of vaccine doses administered in its member states as of Monday was 8.23 million, though in reality the number is much higher.
According to AFP’s own database compiled from official sources, by 1600 GMT Monday, at least 12.6 million doses have been administered to 10.5 million people in the EU, representing 2.3 percent of the population.
“In this early phase of vaccination campaigns, monitoring the number of doses distributed to countries and doses received by individuals provides useful insights into the progress of vaccine deployment and the evolution of vaccination campaigns,” the ECDC said in a statement.
“It also provides initial indicative estimates of vaccine uptake for the first and second dose per population targeted by vaccine recommendations on the national level.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In a meeting with President Duterte and other government officials, Dominguez bared that the government decided to secure additional supply due to the delays in the manufacturing and delivery of the vaccines.
The coronavirus vaccines will be sourced from AstraZeneca , Pfizer, Novavax, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson and Sinovac, according to Dominguez.The government originally intended to secure 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to benefit 70 million Filipinos.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said they have so far locked in 108 million doses and may finalize the supply deals next week.
“This is our program. We need to vaccinate around 70 million. We have negotiations, tayo at saka (we and the) private sector for around 178 million doses good for 92 million people,” Dominguez said.
“We have negotiated for 92 million kasi nababasa natin sa dyaryo may mga slippage, may delay in delivery (we have read in the newspapers about the delay, slippage, delay in deliveries). There is delay in Europe, in the US so to be safe, we are negotiating more than what we need of 70 million,” he added.Dominguez further said: “We really expect delays but delay is not our fault because we have the money, we are ready. Ang delay sa ‘yung manufacturing.”At present, Dominguez said the government will have three approaches in vaccine purchase, namely through multilateral agencies, partnership with the private sector, and partnership with the local government units.
“These approaches are independent but they are coordinated so we will have enough doses to vaccinate 100 percent of adult population,” he said.Under the multilateral approach, Dominguez said the government would source $1.38 billion from foreign lenders such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank (WB) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
“This will fund a total of 106 million doses of vaccines with the value of US $1.2 billion plus we have 40 million doses of vaccines under COVAX. Our contribution to COVAX is only $84 million,” he said.
Dominguez said around 146 to 148 million COVID doses would vaccinate 76 million adults “more than 100 percent of the adult population.”“Ngayon yung mga aged 1-18 years na hindi puwede ma-vaccinate (The population aged 1 to 18 years old who cannot be vaccinated) is around 40 million so we have to vaccinate around 70 million,” he said.The government expects the delivery of the first batch of the coronavirus vaccines this month.
As soon as the supplies arrive in the country, the government plans to prioritize health workers, the elderly, poor citizens, and uniformed personnel in the immunization drive. Priority areas for vaccination are Metro Manila and other areas heavily affected by COVID cases.
The vaccine rollout comes as the country’s cases of coronavirus soared past the 500,000 level mark.The government has kept the general community quarantine status in Metro Manila and several areas to curb the spread of the illness.
Other parts of the country remained in the more relaxed modified general community quarantine. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Government stands to recover from P100 to P120 billion in foregone revenueswhile coronavirus disease (COVID 19) vaccine importations will be granted exemptions on value addedtax(VAT) and duties until 2025 under the proposed reform of corporate income tax and fiscal incentives measure expected to be ratified soon by Congress.
(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)Albay Rep. Joey Sarte Salceda, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, made this disclosure as the bicameral conference committee on the proposed Corporate Reform and Tax Incentives Reform (CREATE)Act is set to submit its recommendation for the consolidation of the House and Senate versions of the bill.
Salceda said the country’s business will finally move swiftly to recover from the effects of the pandemic as soon as Congress submits the consolidated version of the measure for approval by the president.“It’s finished. Both panels are now ready to sign,”saidAlbay Rep. Joey Sarte Salceda as he aired confidence that the bicameral conference committee on CREATE bill will submit its report within a few days.
Salceda said the House and Senate panels have agreed in an informal meeting to iron out the disagreements on the Senate and House versions of the proposed Package 2 of the Duterte government’s Comprehensive Tax Reform Program.
The lawmaker said approval of the measure will help expedite COVID-19 procurement, especially by the private sector.
“Vaccine rollout is the most important economic stimulus measure. We are happy to report that CREATE/CITIRA will also help get it done,” Salceda stated.On the part of the House, the major items the Senate concurred with are: shorter incentives for domestic enterprises, stringent controls against illicit trade in certain ecozones, and longer incentives for all areas outside of NCR.
“Once the revenue estimates are out, I believe we will have saved likely P100-120 billion in foregone revenues compared to the initial Senate version,” the House panel chairman stated.
Salceda also stressed that he is “particularly proud of the incentives for countryside enterprises, and tax savings from incentives for domestic enterprises.”“My greatest fear, on the revenue side, was how redundant tax incentives for domestic enterprises were,” the veteran administration solon said.
According to him at least US$18 billion in foreign direct investments (FDIs) were lost over the “past three years of uncertainty over the delays in passing” the measure.
“Now that it’s done, I expect the investment overhang to close. Investors can now stand on more solid footing,” Salceda said.
“As far as investment uncertainty over tax regime is concerned, that’s finished. The Secretariats are now preparing the final copy as we speak. We will sign this weekend, and ratify by Monday or Tuesday,” Salceda added.
According to Salceda, one key concession his panel was able to obtain from the Senate is that domestic enterprises will be able to avail of 5 years shorter special corporate income tax (SCIT) or enhanced deductions compared to the Senate version. Additionally, they have to have an investment capital of at least P500 million to qualify for the SCIT.
As for critical domestic industries, they will be able to avail of incentives similar to those of export enterprises. The industries qualified as “critical” will be determined by the National Economic Development Authority, as “arbiter between fiscal health and industrial development,” as Salceda described.

ILOILO CITY—The local government of Iloilo City is eyeing more educational institutions to serve as vaccine sites once it starts with its vaccination program against coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Jeck Conlu, the city government’s spokesman on COVID-19, said four more institutions may serve as vaccine sites aside from Central Philippine University (CPU).
Conlu told Manila Bulletin in an interview Monday, February 1, that the Iloilo City government is working to secure the facilities of Ateneo de Iloilo-Santa Maria Catholic School (ADI-SMCS), John B. Lacson Maritime Foundation University (JBLMFU), West Visayas State University (WVSU), and University of San Agustin (USA) as vaccine sites.
This was after CPU hosted a simulation exercise late last week that had over 500 volunteers including nurses and midwives.
Mayor Jerry Treñas vowed to make necessary changes on the city government’s vaccine plan that will be reviewed by the Department of Health (DOH) and the representative of World Health Organization (WHO).
The Iloilo City government has signed a multilateral agreement with British pharmaceutical firm AztraZeneca to acquire 600,000 doses of AZD1222 vaccines.It is supposed to be good for 300,000 people at two doses each. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

But the 41-year-old is no one of an army of volunteers — many with no medical qualifications — being recruited to help deliver Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s goal of vaccinating 15 million of those most at risk from the virus by mid-February.
“When I had the opportunity to do something that made a difference I definitely wanted to jump at it so I immediately signed up when I heard about it,” Day told AFP at a training session for 120 volunteers at Canary Wharf in east London on Saturday.Volunteers, wearing masks and gloves, were instructed how to administer the jab on the 32nd floor of one of the business district’s skyscrapers, its windows commanding views of uninterrupted, rainswept grey skies.
“Aaah!” shouted one instructor, prompting laughter from the audience of volunteers as one participant stuck a needle into the false shoulder tied around her arm.
Another instructor from the St John Ambulance service, which specialises in first aid education, told the volunteers to push the needle “deep into the muscle”.
“Without sounding too cheesy I thought this was a great opportunity to come together to help heal the world,” office assistant Katherine Odell, explained.The 35-year-old said she wasn’t afraid of going out to administer the shot despite the amount of information she has to assimilate.
She admitted there was “always a risk” when faced with the disease but you “keep to the rules as much as you can”.
Eimear Herlihy, 31, explained she was used to seeing patients every day as a dentist.“I’m just really eager for things to go back to normal, so any way that I can help I want to be able to help,” she added.
A 19-year-old medical student at Cambridge University, Shaun Wilson said it was “exciting” to take the theory he had learned and “apply it into something that really can make a difference”.
– ‘Absolutely essential’ –
Volunteers from all walks of life are among the 30,000 individuals who will be recruited by St John Ambulance to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines currently authorised for general use in UK vaccination centres.
To qualify for the volunteer programme, recruits must be over the age of 18 with a secondary school education and pass a criminal background check.
In a separate room, with their chairs carefully spaced to keep to social distancing rules, another group of volunteers is learning how they will inspire confidence in those about to receive their vaccines.They are also instructed how to wash their hands thoroughly, safely remove their personal protective equipment and give first aid.
“One of the associated risks, and a very small associated risk with vaccination, is anaphylaxis, having a severe allergic reaction,” Carl Fazackerley, a St John Ambulance instructor told AFP.
“The screening will have been done by NHS colleagues before,” he added, referring to Britain’s state-run National Health Service. “So this shouldn’t happen, but it’s about being ready to deal with it if it does.”
The training day in Canary Wharf, which is replicated regularly across the UK, allows knowledge acquired during 15 hours of online courses to be put into practice. At the end of their instruction, the volunteers are immersed in a fake vaccination centre.
“Volunteers are absolutely essential to this vaccination programme because what they bring is scale and capacity,” Fazackerley explained.
“The NHS is already under pressure from Covid and to ask the NHS on its own this vaccination would be an impossible task,” he added.
More than 8.9 million people have already received a first dose of the vaccine in the United Kingdom, the first Western country to launch a massive vaccination campaign in early December.
However, the nation is one of the hardest hit by the pandemic with more than 106,000 deaths.
Johnson’s government has set itself the goal of administering 15 million doses of the jab to all individuals over 70 years of age and caregivers by mid-February.
“The only way that we’re really going to see our country come out of this pandemic and the world come out of this pandemic is vaccination,” Fazackerley said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Data from the city government showed that there are 362 active cases out of 26,458 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the capital city as of Sunday noon. Of this figure, 25,312 have recovered while 784 have died.The Manila city government has also sustained its free swab testing efforts for both residents and non-residents of the city. As of January 30, it has already tested 72,000 people.
Meanwhile, around 1,875 people have been swabbed for the city government’s Balik Maynila Free Swab Testing program, that was launched for residents returning to the city after spending the holidays in the province or abroad. At least 20 have tested positive for COVID-19 as of January 29.The city government also recently upgraded its drive-thru serology testing facility at Quirino Grandstand to a swab testing facility, where 654 people have been tested with eight found positive also as of January 29.Domagoso earlier signed an agreement with British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for the advance purchase of 800,000 vaccines that is seen to benefit 400,000 people.
Frontline health workers, senior citizens and other members of vulnerable sectors, uniformed personnel, and public school teachers are included in the city government’s priority list for the vaccine.
Next to be inoculated will be those who pre-registered at the manilacovid19vaccine.com. As of Sunday evening, nearly 79,000 people have registered on the website.The Manila COVID-19 Vaccine Storage Facility was also recently opened at the 7th floor of Sta. Ana Hospital.

Vice President Leni Robredo said Sunday that Filipinos should prefer the COVID-19 vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
(JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Stating her COVID-19 vaccine preference, Robredo said it is not the brand nor the country where it is made that matters the most.
“We have to trust the FDA because it is not about where the vaccine comes from. We know the FDA would not approve any vaccine if it is not sure on its good effects to us,” she said in her radio show.China’s Sinovac Biotech has emerged as a frontrunner in the government’s vaccine rollout because it had committed to deliver doses as early as February.
Its application for Emergency Use Authorization for the COVID-19 vaccine, however, has yet to be approved by the FDA.
The agency has approved AstraZeneca’s vaccine for emergency use, making it the second product to be granted authorization in the country. The vaccine of Pfizer-BioNTech was the first to be issued an EUA.
Robredo said the public does not have to worry about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine once it is approved by the FDA.She has repeatedly expressed her willingness to take vaccine shots in public to help build the confidence of people to get vaccinated.
Aside from Robredo, other government officials like Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, Sen. Bong Go, and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said they would take the first dose of the vaccine once it becomes available in the Philippines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“No Guantanamo detainees have been vaccinated,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby tweeted. “We’re pausing the plan to move forward, as we review force protection protocols. We remain committed to our obligations to keep our troops safe.”
The Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba houses detainees in the US “war on terror,” including top Al-Qaeda figure and alleged 9/11 attack planner Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.The Department of Defense told US media earlier in the week that it would offer vaccines to its detainees and prisoners, to be administered “on a voluntary basis.”
Backlash came from Republican lawmakers including the party’s top congressman, Kevin McCarthy.
“President Biden told us he would have a plan to defeat the virus on day 1. He just never told us that it would be to give the vaccine to terrorists before most Americans,” he said on Twitter.
Added New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik: “It is inexcusable and un-American that President Biden is choosing to prioritize vaccinations for convicted terrorists in Gitmo over vulnerable American seniors or veterans.”
The United States has been the world’s hardest-hit country by the coronavirus pandemic, in absolute terms, with 436,000 deaths and nearly 26 million cases.
President Joe Biden has pledged to vaccine 100 million Americans in his first 100 days in office, but so far the country’s mass inoculation drive has been beset by stumbles, including a shortfall in vaccines and widespread technical difficulties for eligible Americans trying to make appointments.
According to health officials, the US has so far administered just under 30 million of the nearly 50 million doses distributed in the country. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The European Commission on Friday launched a scheme to monitor and in some cases bar exports of vaccines produced in EU plants, amid a row with British-Swedish drugs giant AstraZeneca.

(Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS / AFP)
The move was firmly criticised by the World Health Organization and risked stoking conflict with the UK just weeks after London and Brussels sealed a trade deal.“We paid these companies to increase production and now we expect them to deliver,” EU Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters.“Today’s measure has been adopted with the utmost urgency. The aim is to provide us immediately with full transparency…. And if needed, it also will provide us with a tool to ensure vaccine deliveries.”
EU officials said they expected the order to come into effect on Saturday after its publication in the official journal.The emergency measure is initially for six weeks but is intended to then continue until at least the end of March.The WHO said the move was part of a “very worrying trend” that could jeopardise the global supply chain for vaccines.“It is not helpful to have any country at this stage putting export bans or export barriers that will not allow for the free movement of the necessary ingredients that will make vaccines, diagnostics and other medicines available to all the world,” said Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director for access to medicines and health product.
The EU’s plan applies only to those coronavirus vaccines that are covered by advance purchase agreements between drug companies and the European Commission.Those firms in the EU will have to apply for an authorisation to export doses meant for countries outside the bloc, and show their export records for the previous three months.
A response would normally be given within 48 hours, though that could be extended if necessary.
Most non-EU countries in and around Europe, such as Switzerland, those in the Balkans or micro-states like Monaco, are exempted from the measure.But Britain, which last year left the EU amid much acrimony, is not.
Brussels has been in a furious dispute with AstraZeneca this week, accusing it of breaching its contract by delaying deliveries to EU governments while maintaining those under a deal it signed earlier with the UK.
But Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides insisted: “We are not protecting ourselves against any specific country. And we’re not in competition or in a race against any country.”The prior three-month reporting period would presumably reveal whether or not AstraZeneca did indeed — as has been alleged — send vaccines to Britain from its vaccine plants in Europe, which it says have since been hit by production glitches.
Belgian authorities on Thursday searched one AstraZeneca plant in southern Belgium at the European Commission’s request. Data seized is being analysed.
– ‘A fair approach’ –
EU officials insisted that the scheme is not targeting AstraZeneca alone, but all Covid vaccine-exporting firms tied to the Commission by contracts.
The main goal, they said, was to gather information, though they admitted that in “certain circumstances” vaccine exports could be denied.
“What we want to achieve is of course, a fair approach. And transparency will help us in that respect,” said one official on condition of anonymity.
Vaccines, he said, are “a very strategic product, at a very delicate time”.The officials noted that the EU’s vaccine procurement portfolio is for 2.5 billion doses of authorised and potential vaccines — more than enough for the bloc’s 450 million inhabitants.
That is because the Commission also bought on behalf of poorer countries, with its excess doses to be funnelled through the WHO-led COVAX facility.
“We’re not talking about vaccine nationalism,” one official said. “From the beginning we intended to share these vaccines with our neighbours.”
Right now, though, the EU’s vaccination programme is flagging badly, triggering anger among member states.
On Britain not being exempted from the export-authorisation scheme, one EU official said: “The United Kingdom does not belong to either the COVAX countries nor to the EFTA (EU-linked European Free Trade Association) countries, nor to the neighbourhood.”
Speaking at a virtual news conference later Friday, AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said the firm was working “24/7 to improve the supply we have”.
“We have a very very broad supply chain around the world. We are already producing an enormous amount of vaccine over a month
“Our plan is to source some of this material and bring it to Europe. The first shipment will be about three million doses that are going to leave in the next few days,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Hungary on Friday became the first EU member to approve the Chinese-made Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine, a week after it also broke ranks with Brussels by issuing a provisional permit for Russia’s Sputnik V jab.
“Today the National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition (OGYEI) gave its approval for the Sinopharm vaccine,” Chief Medical Officer Cecilia Muller told a briefing.
A few hours later Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced on his Facebook page that Hungary had agreed to buy “five million doses” of the vaccine, “enough to vaccinate two and a half million people” out of Hungary’s population of 9.8 million.“Delivery will be carried out in four stages, in four months,” he said.
Earlier on Friday Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that he would choose the vaccine for his own inoculation.
“The Chinese have known this virus for the longest time, hence probably they know most about it, so I will wait for my turn, and when I choose I will want the Chinese vaccine,” Orban said.
Budapest expects to order 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm jab for delivery in February, Orban’s chief-of-staff said Thursday.
Last week Hungary became the first EU member to approve Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, and said it had agreed to buy two million doses of the jab.
A decree published Thursday and in effect from Friday allows the foreign minister to license any vaccine that has already been administered to more than one million people, without requiring the Hungarian pharmaceutical authority to sign it off.
The Hungarian government says the decree was needed to speed up the approval process. It also provides for approval if a vaccine has been used in three other countries, including at least one EU or EU-candidate country.Orban said Hungary was monitoring how mass inoculation with a Chinese vaccine is proceeding in neighbouring Serbia, an EU candidate country that is home to a sizeable community of ethnic Hungarians.
Earlier this month, Serbia became the first European country to start a mass vaccination programme with one million doses delivered by Sinopharm.
The Hungarian Chamber of Doctors struck a cautious note in reaction to Friday’s news, urging OGYEI to license “products only in transparent compliance with the rules of pharmaceutical safety, after examination in accordance with the rules of the European Medicines Agency”.
The group said a careful approach was essential “so that our medical colleagues can recommend and administer (vaccines) in good conscience”.
Orban has long courted both Moscow and Beijing as part of what he calls a “pragmatic” foreign policy, and regularly is at loggerheads with Brussels, particularly over migration policy.Criticising the slow pace of delivery of jabs from the EU’s joint procurement programme, Orban said that his government must “stand on two legs” and is looking beyond the EU for vaccine supplies in the US and Israel, as well as Russia and China.
Hungarians’ willingness to get inoculated is one of the lowest rates in the EU but has been rising in recent months.
In a survey published by opinion research firm Publicus on Friday, six out of 10 Hungarians said they would want to get vaccinated, up from four out of 10 in November.
The most popular choices were the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, with the Russian and Chinese jabs least popular. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine generated strong protection against Covid-19 in a large, late-stage trial, raising hopes that it can rapidly reshape a stumbling immunization campaign.

In the more than 44,000-person study, the vaccine prevented 66% of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19, according to a company statement on Friday. And it was particularly effective at stopping severe disease, preventing 85% of severe infections and 100% of hospitalizations and deaths.
“If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress and human suffering” of the pandemic, said Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease official, at a briefing on the results with company and government officials.Based on the result, J&J plans to file for an emergency-use authorization in the US next week. The drug giant’s top scientist said this month that he expects a clearance in March, and that it would have product ready to ship then. The company didn’t specify how much of the vaccine would be available immediately, though it reaffirmed that the US would receive 100 million doses in the first half of the year.
Shares of J&J declined 4% to $162.52 in premarket trading on Friday.
If cleared, J&J’s vaccine could go a long way toward ending the pandemic. Competing vaccines from Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. have generated stronger overall efficacy rates, but require two shots to be given before their full benefits take hold. J&J’s shot also can be kept in a refrigerator for three months, while those from Pfizer and Moderna must be kept frozen.
“This is a single shot that can be given easily, it protects completely from that which we fear, having to go to the emergency room or a hospital,” said Mathai Mammen, head of global research and development for J&J’s pharmaceutical division, in an interview. “It’s going to change the nature of the disease.”Concerns about keeping second doses of the current shots on hand have complicated the push to get as many people as possible inoculated. Some countries have chosen to spread out the time between doses to address the problem, at the risk of diminishing their effectiveness.
The rise of new coronavirus variants has added to the pressure to get immunizations moving faster. The J&J trial was conducted around the globe, including at dozens of clinical-trial sites in hot spots such as South Africa and Brazil where new variants have caused infections to rise.
J&J’s results produced more evidence that the variants will be harder to ward off. In the US, where mutations aren’t thought to be as widespread, the vaccine was 72% effective. But in South Africa, where a variant called B.1.351 is circulating widely, it was only 57% effective. And the shot was 66% effective in Latin America.
Nonetheless, J&J’s vaccine is likely to give countries around the world a powerful new tool to fight a virus that has infected more than 101 million people and killed 2.2 million worldwide.
If confirmed, the results suggest people could get one dose of the vaccine to provide initial protection against severe consequences, allowing them to return to their pre-pandemic lives. Then, if needed, they could later take a booster shot J&J is testing in other large, late-stage trials that could produce results before year-end.
J&J said a review by a monitoring board identified no significant safety concerns. While 9% of people who took the shot developed a fever, there were no severe allergic reactions.
Different Technology
J&J’s vaccine is different from the messenger RNA-based shots made by Moderna and partners Pfizer and BioNTech SE, which each were shown to be more than 90% effective.It is based on an adenovirus, or cold germ modified to make copies of the coronavirus spike protein, which the pathogen uses to force its way into cells. The altered virus can’t replicate in humans, but it triggers an immune response that prepares the body to defend itself against the coronavirus. J&J uses the same technology in a vaccine to fight Ebola.
J&J’s R&D head said the company’s trial, conducted at the height of the pandemic, had to deal with resistant variants that arose mainly after Moderna’s and Pfizer’s trials were completed. When counting cases, it also focused on somewhat sicker patients than other trials, Mammen said.
“If those vaccine programs accrued cases at the same time as us, when viral infections were so much higher, incidents were higher, and variants were all around us, they would have gotten different numbers,” he said. “The fact that we could do this level of efficacy with a single shot, people don’t have to come back for another, and it’s conveniently stored, well that makes this the vaccine of choice.”
At the outset of the pandemic, US government officials said any vaccine showing greater than 50% efficacy would be considered a success.
Like Pfizer and Moderna, Mammen said J&J is working on next-generation versions of the shot that could provide protection specifically against certain variants. Other vaccines have seen mixed results against the newer forms of the virus.
On Thursday, Novavax Inc. reported that a large late-stage study in the U.K. found its Covid vaccine was 89% effective. However, it was just 60% effective in South Africa in people who were HIV negative, and 49.4% effective when HIV positive patients were included. Most cases of the virus seen in the trial had the new South Africa mutation, the company said.
J&J “is already testing and creating vaccines with the ability to respond quickly to the South African strain,” Mammen said.
Gaining Clearance
J&J aims to have a total of seven manufacturing facilities running by the end of the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said Jan. 26. The company says it remains on track to hit the goal of producing 1 billion doses globally before year-end, even as production has been slow to scale up throughout the winter.
J&J’s candidate was among six vaccines tapped for the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed program, receiving some $1.5 billion in backing from the US government. The company intends to price the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis, defined by a Gates Foundation model and determined in conjunction with independent auditors, according to Wolk. The price per shot will not exceed $10, he said.
While the trial readout marks the start of a new phase in the pandemic response, it also is the close of an anxious chapter in the lives of those who developed it. Mammen said he was in his basement office in his home in New Hope, Pennslvania, when he learned the results.
“I’ve been at this for about a year, every day, morning through night,” he said. “When it was unblinded, there was this massive, I mean massive, sense of relief. And great joy. I could finally sleep.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña, in a virtual presser, said the manufacturers arefrom 10 countries.“Out of these, there are already 12 that have signed confidentiality disclosure agreements,” he explained.Dela Peña said that of the 25 vaccine developers, there are six (6) from China, six (6) from the United States, three (3) developers are from Chinese Taipei, two (2) from Russia, two (2) from Australia and two (2) from Germany.There is one developer each from other countries including India (1), Japan (1), United Kingdom (1), and Canada (1).
He explained that for those who have signed CDAs, they will “now be required to send their data for the evaluation of our vaccine expert panel and also the evaluation by the health research ethics board.”
In the DOST Report streamlined on Friday afternoon, dela Peña said that the applications for COVID-19 vaccine Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines that has been approved to date are three: Janssen, Clover, and Sinovac.He added that a Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA) with Bharat Biotech for their clinical trials in the Philippines was recently signed. “But it will still have to go through the evaluation process and the submission of the requirements is being awaited.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso led the launching of the facility during the visit of officials from the Coordinated Operations to Defeat Epidemic (CODE) Team.Manila Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna-Pangan, vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Action Plan against COVID-19 Carlito Galvez Jr., testing czar and deputy chief implementer of the National Action Plan against COVID-19 Vince Dizon, Food and Drug Administration Director Eric Domingo, Department of Health Assistant NCR Regional Director Paz Corrales, and Anti-Red Tape Authority Director General Jeremiah Belgica joined the inspection.The storage facility is located at the 7th floor of Sta. Ana Hospital. Earlier, Domagoso said they chose the hospital as the location of the facility because it has power generators that will help prevent the compromise of the vaccines’ integrity during power outages.
Manila city government officials have also had discussions with the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) to ensure the steady power supply in the hospital, he added.The Manila COVID-19 vaccine storage facility is equipped with various refrigerator units that will be used for the safekeeping of vaccines from different pharmaceutical companies.There are five HYC-390 refrigerators for AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccines, two -25°C and two -30°C biomedical freezers for Janssen and Moderna vaccines, respectively.Three-86°C ULT freezers, which can store Pfizer vials, and 50 transport coolers are also set to be delivered to the hospital.
Domagoso encouraged the public to get vaccinated, saying that it is the key to reviving the Philippine economy.“COVID-19 vaccination ang susi sa pagbubukas muli ng ekonomiya (COVID-19 vaccination is the key to opening up the economy),” he said.“Gusto ko na pong makabalik na sa trabaho ang mga tao nang panatag, makasakay na sila ulit ng public transportation nang komportable, magbukas ang mga negosyo, makagalaw na ang mga nawalan ng trabaho, makabalik na ang mga bata sa eskwela (I want the people to return to work, to ride public transportation comfortably, for businesses to open, for displaced workers to start looking for work, for students to return to schools),” he added.
The Manila city government had earlier secured an advance purchase of 800,000 COVID-19 vaccines from British-Swedish biopharmaceutical AstraZeneca.Domagoso also said they are eyeing to purchase more vaccines from other pharmaceutical firms. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

BACOLOD CITY (Philippine News Agency) – The City of Bacolod is among the identified sites in the country to conduct the Phase 3 clinical trials of Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine.
(Photo courtesy of City Administrator Em Ang/ PNA)City Administrator Em Ang said members of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) were briefed by Dr. Adonis Guancia, the principal administrator of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine clinical trial in the city, about the development during a meeting held on Wednesday at the Bacolod Government Center.
“They are currently recruiting volunteers for the pivotal Phase 3 trials of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine,” Ang, who is also the EOC executive director and deputy for administration and operations, said in a statement posted on Facebook.
She also posted that “(t)he randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in at least 500 adults, 40 years old and older, including significant representation from those who have comorbidities”.
“The trials mark the first for a Covid-19 vaccine in the Philippines and would allow the Philippines to contribute to worldwide knowledge on the development of a Covid-19 vaccine. The trials will also help scientists and medical experts confirm the effects of the vaccine on Filipinos,” the post added.
Janssen is among the two Covid-19 vaccine developers, which have secured approval from the Department of Health’s Ethics Review Board last December.
In a Facebook post on Jan. 23, Guancia said the clinical trial will start on Feb. 1.
“We will commence recruitment soon. Instructions regarding registration and qualifications of volunteers will soon be announced in several media outlets,” he said.
The trial is designed primarily to determine if the investigational vaccine can prevent moderate to severe Covid-19 after a single dose. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Meanwhile, only 9.1 percent of them said they were reluctant in getting a vaccine while 33.3 percent remain undecided, Alimurung added.The city official said many of those who do not want to get vaccinated yet are worried “about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine, while others have health issues such as allergies.”
He added that those who remain undecided explained that they are still “having second thoughts about the side effects, while others would base their final decision on what brand of vaccine would be used by the city government.”
Recently, the local government entered into a tripartite agreement with British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and the national government for the procurement of 1.1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the city.

Go,by Mario Casayuran,"Published January 27, 2021, 2:40 PM","Senator Christopher Go on Wednesday strongly urged concerned authorities to ensure that once there is sufficient supply of COVID-19 vaccines that are proven safe and effective, there must be a distribution plan to guarantee access for all Filipinos — especially the poor and vulnerable —and thosein rural and underserved areas as the government targets to inoculate half of the population in 2021.

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III had said some 57 to 60 million Filipinos are expected to receive vaccines secured by the government within the year.This is in addition to the approximately 10 million to 13 million that will be vaccinated by the local government units (LGUs) and the private sector.“Mahalaga na makakaabot ang mga bakunang ito sa mga pinaka-nangangailangan na dapat makatanggap. May mga taong hindi alam kung saan pupunta at ni hindi alam kung ano ang ibig sabihin ng vaccine… Sila ang kailangan lumabas at magtrabaho upang buhayin ang pamilya nila. Sila ang mga isang kahig, isang tuka,’’ Go said. (It is important that the vaccines reach those who really are in need to have it. There are people who do not where to go and do not even understand what a vaccine is…They are the ones that need to go out and work to support their families. They are those who endure a “hand-to-mouth” existence),” said Go.The senator from Davao stressed that government must meet its target within the agreed time frame while addressing the logistical challenges facing the rollout, particularly in medically underserved areas that have fewer healthcare facilities and workers.
As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Go said that the poor and vulnerable sectors be given priority access to vaccines.This, explained Go, would allow the government to reopen the economy and help address the issue of hunger in impoverished communities.“Pag magbubukas na tayo, makakabalik na po ang mga kababayan natin unti-unti sa kanilang mga trabaho. Kaya nga po sa ngayon, ‘yon ang inuunang tutukan ng ating mga finance managers, ‘yung hunger (rate) — from thirty-one [percent], I think, bumaba sa sixteen [percent].

That is why for now, our finance managers are focused on hunger (rate) — from 31 [percent], I think, it went down to 16 percent]. This should go down further and no Filipino should go hungry.)“Kaya binabalanse ng ating mahal na Pangulo [Rodrigo Duterte] ang lahat.

(This is why our beloved President [Rodrigo Duterte] is balancing everything. Especially those that are really affected and those who lost their jobs. That is the priority of the government. It is now addressing whatever it can help.)Go emphasized that the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines are necessary in building the trust and confidence of the Filipino people as many of them are still reluctant to get vaccinated.He said that the Philippines could learn from the experiences of other countries which have already started their rollout, particularly in anticipating any adverse effects of the vaccines.Go also welcomed the efforts to expedite the solidarity vaccine trial in the Philippines as he commended President Duterte for his decision to approve the funds for the World Health Organization solidarity trial for COVID-19 in the country.In another development, Go assured the public that President Duterte would not be pressured by any country providing COVID-19 vaccines, allaying fears that China could put pressure on the Philippines to support their own interests in exchange for the vaccines.“Ang isyu ngayon dito ay bakuna.

FDA Director-General Eric Domingo said both the technical quality panel and safety and efficacy panel have finished its evaluation of the vaccine and have given AstraZenca’s COVID-19 vaccine positive recommendations.
“I’m just going to look at data now, both from the technical quality side and then the safety and efficacy side, and recommendations. I hope to finish going through this today or maybe tomorrow.

Where it is manufactured, how it is supposed to be handled, the indications, who can use it…We’re just really finalizing that,” the FDA director-general added.
Domingo said the process for granting Astranzenca an EUA was shorter compared to other vaccines because it already has an EUA from the United Kingdom which is stringent regulatory body.

WASHINGTON/PARIS – More than 100 million COVID-19 cases have now been recorded worldwide, according to an AFP tally on Tuesday, as newly inaugurated President Joe Biden pledged to ramp up the United States’ struggling vaccine program.The number of cases, compiled from data provided by national health agencies, represents just a fraction of the real infections as the coronavirus has spread around the globe.Laboratory technicians work to process samples to test for the novel coronavirus Covid-19, at Biogroup Laboratory’s lab in west London on January 21, 2021.

The United States, which passed 25 million confirmed cases last weekend, remains the country with the largest outbreak – and the largest death toll of over 420,000.
Biden is seeking to turn around the fight against the virus, which took a ferocious grip on the country during Donald Trump’s presidency when the risks were downplayed and officials gave mixed messages on mask wearing other safety measures.Biden said vaccinating the entire US population was a daunting challenge, and the program inherited from the Trump administration “was in worse shape than we anticipated or expected.”“This is a war-time undertaking. It’s not hyperbole,” he said, announcing the US was buying an additional 200 million doses and will have enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans — virtually the entire population — by early fall.In another day of grim milestones, Britain surged past 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, and other European nations looked to tighten their borders, hoping to keep out new, more transmissible virus strains.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was “hard to compute” the loss felt by British families after his country became the first European country to surpass 100,000 COVID-19 deaths.But he said his government, which faced criticism over its initial response to the outbreak, “did everything that we could to minimize suffering and minimize loss of life.”‘Drastic measures’The London Times said the UK government will announce Wednesday that British travelers must quarantine in hotels near airports for 10 days after returning from 30 high-risk countries, mostly in South America and Southern Africa.
Neighboring Ireland said Tuesday it would enact mandatory travel quarantines for the first time, as well extending its third national lockdown until March 5.Among other European nations looking to strengthen border controls was Germany, which said it is considering almost completely halting flights into the country.“The danger from the numerous virus mutations forces us to consider drastic measures,” Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told the Bild newspaper.
Iceland, meanwhile, started to issue vaccination certificates to ease travel for those who have had both required doses.The new measures came as anger rises over grinding anti-coronavirus restrictions, with the Netherlands rocked by nightly riots since it imposed a curfew on Saturday.
More than 400 people were arrested after the worst unrest to hit the country in four decades, but the Dutch government said it would not back down.“You don’t capitulate to people who smash shop windows,” Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said, calling the rioters “scum.”Israeli police also clashed with protesters, arresting 14 people after ultra-Orthodox Jews demonstrated against lockdown measures.
With the global death toll at 2.1 million, the world has looked to vaccines to break the gloom, but bickering over access to doses has intensified.Tensions have in particular mounted between the European Union and pharmaceutical firms over delays to deliveries.“Europe invested billions to help develop the world’s first COVID-19 vaccines,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen told the virtual World Economic Forum (WEF).“And now, the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations.”Israel leads the vaccine race
Europe’s vaccination campaign stumbled after British-Swedish drugs company AstraZeneca warned it would not be able to meet promised targets on EU shipments – a week after US group Pfizer said it was also delaying delivery volumes.AstraZeneca’s CEO insisted Tuesday that the company was not selling vaccines ordered by the EU to other countries at a profit.None of the world’s 29 poorest countries has formally started mass COVID-19 vaccination drives, while the richest nations have given more than two thirds of the 69 million jabs administered so far.The favored ones include 49 countries mainly in North America, Europe and the Gulf which have already launched their mass vaccination drives.Of the poor countries Guinea is acting as a pioneer, having vaccinated a couple of dozen as a trial.Middle income countries are not faring well either, with only the richest among them – including China, Russia, Turkey and Brazil – getting 28 percent of the total jabs on offer.Israel is by far leading the way in the vaccine race, with 31 percent of its population having received at least one dose.The United Kingdom has given jabs to around 10 percent of its population and the United States, the world’s worst-stricken country to nearly six percent of its people.The world’s richest countries and the more well off middle income countries have 97 percent of the doses in their hands.The remaining three percent have been given in India, which has injected more than two million doses.On Sunday Egypt became the second country in the lower tier of the middle income countries to launch its vaccination campaign.The WHO and its official vaccine coalition Gavi have set up a mechanism to distribute vaccines to poorer countries, but not a single dose has yet been administered.The program is lacking the billions of dollars needed to achieve the goal of providing doses to 20 percent of the population of target countries by the end of the year.

National Task Force Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. also joined the mayors’ meeting, Garcia said.
He said no specific date was given for the arrival in the country of the vaccines. “Kung kailan, ang definite lang na binigay is, before the end of February, may darating (As to when, the only definite detail given was that they will arrive before the end of February),” Garcia said.He added that the quantity and brand of the vaccines are also not known. “Pero may tatlong brands na tinitignan na pwedeng dumating (But they are looking at three possible brands for our incoming supply).”

Brazil recently approved CoronaVac, the vaccine made by Beijing-based company Sinovac, thereby enabling Latin America’s largest nation to begin their immunization program. CoronaVac has demonstrated 100% protection against severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in the recently-concluded clinical trial involving 12,476 healthcare workers in Brazil. This trial is currently the only publicly disclosed phase 3 clinical trial (involving COVID-19 vaccines), where participants were all healthcare workers working in hospitals. Accordingly, it provides an actual indication of the capability of this vaccine to protect the critical healthcare workforce. Several days after Brazil’s announcement, Chile announced the emergency use approval of CoronaVac as well. Sinovac has agreements in place with at least eight countries, including Turkey, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Chile, and Brazil.
CoronaVac was recently granted approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines (FDA) and the Department of Health’s Single Joint Research Ethics Board (SJREB) to conduct clinical trials in the Philippines. Sponsored and financed by IP Biotech, Inc. which combined the latest in technological and medical advances,the study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted on volunteers aged 60 to 80 years, “The trial, which is representative of our local circumstances and in a target age group, will provide supplemental data to the global trials,” saidDr. Noel Miranda, a member of the scientific team of IP Biotech, Inc., a Filipino biotech/vaccine provider. “Given the FDA approval and the unbiased framework of the study, I am optimistic that CoronaVac’s worthiness for massive vaccination will further be validated. It is our hope that the Filipinos, especially our elderly population, would all benefit from the protection that this promising vaccine offers.”
Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency began rolling out CoronaVac on Monday, and has announced plans to vaccinate priority groups starting with health workers, people above 60 years of age, disabled people, and the indigenous population. The country now has six million doses of Sinovac’sCoronaVac on hand.Previously, the 50.4% overall efficacy reported from Brazil’s Phase 3 trials drew public attention. Investigators, however, soon pointed out that the results came from all cases, including “very mild” cases that did not require medical intervention. It was further revealed that the study participants were all healthcare workers constantly exposed to COVID-19 transmissions in the hospital setting, at attack rates close to five times the average.
“Vaccine efficacy must be thoroughly evaluated in relation to the methodology. In the case of the Brazil trial, their analysis included very mild COVID-19 cases occurring in high transmission-risk settings,” noted Dr. Noel Miranda, a member of the scientific team of IP Biotech, Inc., a Filipino biotech/vaccine provider.
“The overall protection rate of 50.4%, given the circumstances, is indeed acceptable and provides a sense of assurance in light of the 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization obtained in Brazil and Turkey,” he added. “Given the current understanding that none of the EUA-approved vaccines are capable of preventing asymptomatic and mild infections, the true merit of being vaccinated lies in reducing disease severity and mortality, where the disease would just manifest as a common cold with mild symptoms.By aiming for this, we can also help alleviate fear.” he further explained.

“We’re denying the perception that the teachers will be the ones who will administer the vaccines to our youth or their fellow teachers,” Education Secretary Leonor Briones said during the Laging Handa Public Briefing.Briones said that there are very strict protocols when it comes to medicine. “Kung hindi ka trained medical personnel, hindi ka naman isasabak sa mga medical procedures (If you are not a trained medical personnel, you will not be forced to administer medical procedures), she explained.Even the Department of Health (DOH), Briones said, made it clear that the teachers will not be tapped to administer COVID-19 vaccines. “They not qualified to do this because their training is teaching,” she added.Briones said that DepEd needs to make the clarification that teachers will not participate in any medical procedures involving COVID-19 vaccines.
“We have to clarify that because it is a crime to engage in medical procedures if you are not a trained personnel,” she said.“This is NOT allowed, the DOH has never said that and we never said that as well,” she explained.Instead of participating in the actual medical procedure, Briones said that the teachers will play a bigger role when it comes to information dissemination.“The biggest contribution of teachers is to disseminate information on vaccines,” she said.
“Even for that, they have to be briefed also so they would fully understand the benefits and the protection offered by the vaccine on teachers,” she added.Teachers, Briones stressed, will be more involved in the “education aspect” of the vaccination and not in participating in the medical procedures.
“That would really be malpractice and of course, that’s criminal – both DepEd and DOH have not contemplated such action,” she ended. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

CEBU CITY—The Department of Health-Central Visayas (DOH 7) has started preparing for the roll-out of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine in the region.
Department of Health (DOH) (MANILA BULLETIN)
Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, information officer of DOH 7, said preparations include the ongoing negotiations with pharmaceutical companies and other establishments capable of storing the vaccines.
The DOH 7 is looking for ultralow freezers or biomed freezers that can generate negative 70 degrees centigrade temperatures.The DOH 7 is also preparing for the training and retraining of the Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams for the coming vaccination.
Private hospitals have expressed their readiness to take part in the training, as well as in the vaccination, said Loreche.
“We are planning to hold a simulation as part of our ongoing preparations for the COVID-19 vaccination program,” Loreche said in a virtual press conference on Monday.
The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF-MEID) has identified Cebu City as one of the three local government units in the country that will receive first COVID-19 vaccines.Loreche said it has not yet been determined many doses or what vaccine brand the city will be receiving.
Loreche said the DOH 7 intends to vaccinate at least 60 percent of the entire population in the city to achieve herd immunity. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

DILG Undersecretary Epimaco Densing issued the call during the CODE Team visit in Pasig City where he cited the importance of educating the public about the government’s vaccination program to entice them to heed the call for them to be inoculated to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
In a GMA News report, Densing emphasized that the LGUs must explain vividly the urgency of being vaccinated and restore confidence in the government’s vaccination program.Densing said that at present fake news and misinformation are widespread causing some to have second thoughts of being vaccinated.
“Right now, marami hong fake news na lumalabas at ;pag di natin ‘to na-verify at na-explain sa ating kababayan, maaaring mawalan ng kumpiyansa ang ating mga kababayan (there a lots of fake news coming out and if we do not verify and explain this to the public then they may lose confidence in the program (vaccination), ’’Densing said.
He also cited that the government’s vaccination program is essential as this measure will curb the transmission of COVID-19 in the country.
“Binibigyang-diin ko po na hindi tayo puwedeng magkamali dito sa national immunization program natin. ito ang importanteng pamamaraan para matigil natin, malabanan ang COVID-19 na gumugulo sa ating bayan at sa ibang bansa (Iam stressing that there should be no room for mistake in the national immunization program since this is a vital way to stop and fight COVID-19 that has created havoc in our country and oversees),’’ Densing ended.

https://mb.com.ph/2021/01/26/moderna-says-covid-vaccine-effective-against-uk-s-africa-variants/,"Moderna says Covid vaccine effective against UK, S.Africa variants",by Agence France-Presse,"Published January 26, 2021, 6:12 AM","
US biotechnology firm Moderna on Monday said lab studies showed its Covid-19 vaccine remains effective against variants of the coronavirus first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa.
To study the impact of the Moderna vaccine, called mRNA-1273, the company took blood samples from eight people who had received two doses of the vaccine, and from primates that had also been immunized
But the positive news was tempered by the finding that there was a sixfold reduction in the level of highly-potent neutralizing antibodies produced against the South African variant, B.1.351.
Out of caution, the company will test adding a second booster of its vaccine — to make three shots in total — and has begun preclinical studies on a booster specifically for the South African variant.“We are encouraged by these new data, which reinforce our confidence that the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should be protective against these newly detected variants,” said Stephane Bancel, Moderna’s CEO.
“Out of an abundance of caution and leveraging the flexibility of our mRNA platform, we are advancing an emerging variant booster candidate against the variant first identified in the Republic of South Africa into the clinic.”
The emergence of highly contagious variants to the SARS-CoV-2 virus had triggered concern about their impact on the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines even as countries begin to accelerate their immunization programs.
Both the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in the UK and the B.1.351 variant have multiple mutations along the “spike protein,” molecules that dot the surface of the virus and allow it to invade human cells.
Scientists have been particularly worried that the mutations on B.1.351 would lead to the virus escaping the action of antibodies, and render the current generation of vaccines obsolete.Moderna’s vaccine uses mRNA — a type of genetic molecule — to deliver the information for human cells to create the spike protein inside the human body, in order to trigger an immune response.
A booster for B.1.351 would therefore carry the mRNA that creates the spike protein with the mutations that are specific to the variant.
A major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed in a matter of weeks, even though producing them to mass scale may take much longer.
– Reaction mixed –To study the impact of the Moderna vaccine, called mRNA-1273, the company took blood samples from eight people who had received two doses of the vaccine, and from primates that had also been immunized.
For the B.1.1.7 variant there was no impact on the level of neutralizing antibodies — which bind to the spike protein and prevent it from invading human cells — that were produced by the shots.
But for the South African variant, B.1.351, there was a sixfold reduction in the neutralizing antibody level.
Even so, the company said it remained above the quantity that was shown to be protective in earlier tests on primates that were infected on purpose.Reaction to Moderna’s statement by independent experts was mixed.
Akiko Iwasaki, a leading virologist from Yale, tweeted: “This is good,” adding that she expected other vaccine makers were also developing boosters that target the South African variant.
Benjamin Neuman, a virologist from Texas A&M university, agreed and told AFP that the reduction in potency pertained to only one type of antibody, that make up one percent of the overall antibodies that bind to the spike protein of the virus, which it uses to enter cells.
“To be clear, the 99 percent of antibodies that bind to other parts of the spike and are not neutralizing should still work just as well on the mutant strains,” he said.
He added the decrease found in the study “would be more a bellwether of potential problems to come than a sign of imminent danger,” adding that in a living person, the immune system learns to adjust the antibodies it produces if their efficiency decreases.
But Lawrence Young, a virologist at Britain’s Warwick University, said the sixfold reduction was a matter “of concern” and suggested vaccine efficacy as well as duration of protection could be impacted.
Moderna, which carried out the studies with the National Institutes of Health, has submitted the study to a preprint server so it can be analyzed by the wider scientific community. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

https://mb.com.ph/2021/01/26/picking-the-right-covid-19-vaccine-for-you/,Picking the right COVID-19 vaccine for you,by Dr. Edsel Salvana,"Published January 26, 2021, 12:39 AM","What should you consider when getting a vaccine?
Dr. Edsel Maurice T. SalvanaIf you told people that there was a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 last year at the start of the pandemic, many would have rushed to get it and they would not have cared who made the vaccine or where it came from. Now that there are several safe and effective vaccines with emergency authorization, there is some confusion on which vaccine is the best, and which one to pick. Should you wait for the best vaccine, or take the first one that is available? The answers to these questions can get very technical and can go beyond just looking at the touted vaccine efficacy numbers in mainstream media.
Safety
MODERNA
The two most important traits of any COVID-19 vaccine are its safety and efficacy. Safety is established through an increasing number of patients from Phase 1 to Phase 3 clinical trials. If a vaccine is found to be unsafe in the early studies, it will never get to Phase 3 because no one will use a vaccine that carries substantial risk. The key term here is reasonably safe, as most vaccines will give you a sore arm and some may cause fever. Any deaths during the trials are thoroughly investigated to see if it may be somehow linked to the vaccine. If an experimental vaccine is linked to a significant number of deaths, clinical trials are unlikely to progress further.Phase 3 trials typically involve thousands to tens of thousands of participants. The number of people recruited depends on the effect that is being looked at. The degree of safety for these kinds of trials makes it unlikely that any severe reaction that occurs more than once out of 1,000 vaccine doses will be missed.
SINOVAC
The length of follow-up for safety vaccine recipients is usually set at one to two years before a vaccine is approved for market. With the current pandemic, however, too many people will die if we wait that long before we deploy a potentially effective vaccine. Two million people have already died of COVID-19 in just one year. To address the pandemic emergency, many of the country regulatory authorities have turned to the emergency use authorization designation (EUA).
PHIZER VACCINE
An EUA allows vaccines for limited use as long as they have demonstrated a minimum clinical efficacy of at least 50 percent and a minimum length of safety follow-up over at least two months. The minimum level of efficacy is set at 50 percent because patient populations that are at higher risk for dying will already substantially benefit from such a vaccine. This benefit is greater than the potentially rare adverse events that may be found later on. For people outside the high-risk groups, the benefit over the risk may still be favorable, but it may also be reasonable to wait for longer safety follow-up or a better vaccine without as high a risk of a bad outcome.
EfficacyWhen clinical trials are designed to see how well a vaccine works, the most important value that is measured is the primary outcome. This is the outcome that is measured to determine whether a vaccine works or not, and how well the vaccine works. There are many ways of looking at vaccine efficacy, depending on the primary outcome. The easiest way to measure vaccine efficacy is to see how often someone who gets the vaccine develops clinical disease compared with someone who got a placebo or an inactive ingredient.
Clinical disease means that someone is infected and manifests symptoms of disease. When all infections result in symptoms, vaccine clinical efficacy usually correlates well with the ability of the vaccine to prevent infection. When there are a significant number of asymptomatic infections like in COVID-19, it becomes more difficult to measure a vaccine’s ability to prevent all infection. Since even asymptomatic COVID-19 patients can infect others, the clinical efficacy of any COVID-19 vaccine will not translate into its ability to prevent infection.
Clinical trials for the current Phase 3 vaccines that have been approved for COVID-19 have focused on clinical efficacy to expedite the rollout of an effective vaccine. After someone gets the vaccine or a placebo, the clinical trials investigators instruct the patients to seek care if they develop any COVID-19 symptoms. Only then will they test them to see if they truly have COVID-19. A comparison is made between the number of patients who get COVID-19 in the vaccine group versus the number of patients who get COVID-19 in the placebo group. The vaccine clinical efficacy is derived from this. The vaccine clinical efficacy for preventing any symptomatic clinical disease for the Pfizer vaccine is 95 percent, while for Moderna it is 94 percent. It is 62 percent for the Astra vaccine and 50.4 percent for Sinovac. None of these values reflect the ability to prevent transmission, only the ability to prevent clinical disease.Beyond prevention of clinical disease, it is also important to think about how well a vaccine prevents severe disease. While Pfizer was able to prevent 95 percent of clinical disease among its vaccinees, it was only able to prevent 89 percent of severe disease compared to placebo. Astra, Moderna, and Sinovac had no cases of severe disease in their vaccinated groups compared to placebo, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 100 percent for preventing severe disease. No one expects any of these vaccines to perform as well as this in real practice, but if properly used, the vaccine effectiveness on rollout against severe disease will be quite high and will save many, many lives. This is especially true among the most vulnerable groups such as the elderly and frontline healthcare workers among whom up to 10 percent of those infected can die.
Finally, herd immunity is currently not guaranteed for any of the COVID-19 vaccines. To prove transmission interruption, even asymptomatic people will have to be swabbed periodically and asymptomatic infection rates compared between those who were vaccinated versus placebo. This is much harder to demonstrate and will take a longer time. Moderna is doing some of these studies and early data shows that it may block up to 2/3 of transmission of COVID-19. This is less certain for the other vaccines.
To get or not to get vaccinated
There are over 200 vaccines in development and at least 10 have gotten some form of EUA or an equivalent designation. In the Philippines, only the Pfizer vaccine has gotten an EUA. An absolute requirement for the EUA in the Philippines is complete Phase 3 clinical data with a minimum length of safety follow-up. Among the vaccines that have this data are Pfizer, Moderna, Astra, and Sinovac. Pfizer and Moderna have published their results in peer-reviewed journals. Astra has published interim results but it has not published its final clinical trial results. Sinovac recently released partial data from its completed clinical trial in Brazil in a press conference, but the publicly available details remain sparse.
The two vaccines that will most likely get here by the end of February are the Pfizer vaccine and Sinovac. The Pfizer vaccine is via the WHO Covax facility and Sinovac has committed 50,000 doses for the end of February. Only Pfizer, however, currently has an EUA and it is not certain whether Sinovac will get an EUA by then.
Unless you are a frontliner, it is unlikely that you will be offered the vaccine as part of the government program in February. If there is enough supply to cover all frontliners nationwide, the next priority group will be seniors. If you belong to either of these groups, you should take whatever vaccine is offered unless you have a specific contraindication. This is because Pfizer is 95 percent clinically effective and reduces the risk of severe COVID-19 by 89 percent.
If only Sinovac is available, it may still be worthwhile because even though it is only 50.4 percent clinically effective against mild disease, it completely protected against severe disease in the clinical trial population. Remember that high risk groups have a 10 percent chance of dying and so holding out for a better vaccine may be too late.
More vaccines, including Astra and Moderna, may arrive in the second and third quarter of 2021. Both Astra and Moderna completely protected against severe disease in its clinical trials, and clinical efficacy was 62 percent and 94 percent respectively. People who will be eligible for this will include the remaining frontliners and seniors, people with comorbid conditions and essential workers. More shipments of Pfizer and Sinovac may arrive and more vaccines may already be granted EUAs by then. There may also be more data regarding transmission-blocking effects and also which vaccines work best against the new variants.
If you do not belong to the high-risk priority groups, don’t feel bad. The more time there is to observe the effects of the vaccines in a bigger population, the safer it will be for you. You may also have a wider array of vaccines to choose from, and some of them may be safer and more efficacious with a longer duration of protection. In the meantime, it is important to stick to the minimum health standards to decrease the risk of infection and of passing on the disease to other people.
In the end, the kind of vaccine that may be best for you comes down to clinical efficacy, availability, the ability to prevent severe disease, and the risk group you belong to. If you are in a high-risk group, getting the first available vaccine that can protect you from severe disease and dying is paramount. If you are not in the severe risk group, waiting for better vaccines isn’t a bad thing. Either way, the end of the pandemic is in sight so let’s ensure as many of us get there alive and healthy.

President Duterte has vowed to personally look into the prices of the coronavirus vaccines secured by the government to determine if they are “reasonable.”

Addressing the nation Monday night, the President said he intends to “take a look and ask around” about the cost of the vaccines, telling the nation that the government’s supply arrangements made by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. will still undergo a review.
“That’s not the end of the everything. The decision of Galvez is not, I said, the sum total of it all. It has to be reviewed,” Duterte said during his remarks aired on state television.“And finally sa akin rin, I will take a look and ask around if it is really a reasonable pricing for us,” he added.
The price of the COVID-19 vaccines purchased by the government is among the contentious issues tackled in a recent Senate inquiry. Some lawmakers have pressed on officials to reveal the price for the sake of transparency but Galvez declined to do so owing to the confidentiality deal with the manufacturers. The Palace earlier dispelled concerns about the alleged high cost of the vaccine, saying a dose developed by China’s Sinovac only costs more or less P600.
In the same address, the President brushed aside claims that some people supposedly managed to thwart an attempt on overpricing or corruption in the government’s vaccine purchase. Those making such claim were only muddling the issue, according to Duterte.“May statement that they were able to prevent corruption or overprice because of their vigilance. No. Far from it actually. You’re just muddling up, ginugulo lang ninyo (You’re just muddling the issue),” he said.He maintained that the government’s supply arrangements with vaccine makers must still go through scrutiny of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez. It is unlikely that any irregularity will slip past the finance chief, he added.
“Dadaan pa ‘yan kay Dominguez and you know how Dominguez is.Tingnan mo kung makalusot yan kay Dominguez (It will still go through with Dominguez and you know how Dominguez is. Let’s see if that will pass through Dominguez),” he added.
In the early part of his speech, the President said he wanted to talk to the people alleging corruption in the government’s vaccination program.
Duterte remained skeptical about such allegations, insisting that no actual money will change hands in the procurement.“Walang pera. Laway pa lang ito lata. Conversation, istorya. may nagsabi na corruption or they were able to obstruct or prevent corruption because of their timely… (There is no actual money. It’s all talk for now, conversation, story. Some said there were able to obstruct or prevent corruption because of their timely intervention),” he said.
“Mag-usap tayo. Tayo lang kung sino nagsabi niyan please rise and be brave enough to say you’re the one. I’d like to talk to you. Tayong dalawa lang (Let’s talk. Whoever said that please rte and brave enough to say you’re the one. I’d like to talk to you. Just the two of us),” he said.
The government earlier set aside P82.5 billion for the purchase of coronavirus vaccines for Filipinos. It has sought financial aid from multilateral partners like World Bank and Asian Development Bank to help secure the country’s vaccine supplies.
The government has so far secured millions of doses of vaccines from suppliers like Novavax, Sinovac, Moderna and AstraZeneca.The first batch of the supplies is expected to be delivered in the country next month. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“We would like to clarify that we will continue to receive vaccine allocation for 20 percent of the population from COVAX,” the Health department and the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 said in a statement.
COVAX Facility is a global procurement mechanism which invests in a broad portfolio of promising vaccine candidates to support their research, development, and manufacturing.Despite the new developments, the Philippines’ vaccine cluster said the country will still push through with the 20-percent allocation.
“Previously, this entire 20 percent was to be provided to the country for free,” the vaccine cluster said.
However, based on the latest developments, only 15 percent will be free and “the remaining 5 percent will be paid by the country.”
The vaccine cluster said the budget for the five percent has already been secured.“Hence, even with these changes in financing, rest assured that there will be no delays in delivery of the vaccines,” the vaccine cluster said.
“We remain to be on the right direction and that vaccines are arriving,” it vowed.
The vaccine cluster had earlier announced that the country is set to receive COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility within the first quarter of this year. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Amid the expected arrival of COVID-19 vaccines by next month, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the vaccines are not “magic pills” against the illness.
“Gusto namin laging ipaalala sa ating mga kababayan na itong mga bakuna hindi po ito magic pill. Not because you have been vaccinated already, hindi ka na susunod sa minimum public health standards (We always want to remind our people that these vaccines are not magic pills. Not because you have been vaccinated already, you will no longer follow the minimum public health standards),” she said.Vergeire said that the effects of COVID-19 vaccines still need further study.
“We still don’t have sufficient evidence to have that assurance that they won’t get infected with COVID-19 if they have the vaccine. What we are seeing so far are less chances of having full blown diseases, of needing hospitalization, and of dying,” she said. “Also it is still unknown how long the immunity the vaccines can provide will last,” she added.
With this, the DoH spokesperson said that it is imperative to still adhere to the minimum public health standards.
“Even if you have already been vaccinated, you still need to wear your mask, you still need to wear your face shield, you still need to do the physical distancing, avoiding crowded areas, and all,” she said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

But his ex-Soviet republic is caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war that is delaying a national vaccine rollout in one of Europe’s poorest countries.
“We live in constant stress,” the surgeon told AFP at the Kiev hospital where he works.“It’s insulting that colleagues in countries that produce vaccines — and even colleagues in countries where they aren’t produced — have already been vaccinated,” he said, clad in protective gear before entering a virus ward.
The stakes are high for Ukraine, where a population of some 40 million rely on a ageing and understaffed public health care system that is buckling under a caseload of 1.2 million infections and 21,000 deaths.
The government has said that the vaccine drive could start mid-February but medical staff are sceptical since no official date for a first delivery has been finalised.
President Volodymyr Zelensky has blamed the delay on richer Western countries that reserved the Pfizer and Moderna jabs in bulk.“The richest found themselves first in the global vaccine queue,” he said in December.
He has urged the EU to help eastern European countries source vaccines, following on from a similar appeal to Brussels by some of the bloc’s members to “go beyond the current initiatives”.
– Catastrophic moral failure’ –
Ukraine however is not alone in its fight for the vaccine.The head of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week that the world faced a “catastrophic moral failure” over the distribution of jabs to poor countries.
Ukraine so far secured 8 million doses through the UN Covax mechanism helping poorer nations with distribution, and Kiev expects to obtain up to 5 million doses of the Chinese vaccine CoronaVac once it is registered.
But those numbers combined fall far short in a country of more than 40 million.
Neighbouring EU member Poland by comparison has secured over 60 million doses for its 38 million inhabitants.
“It’s not a question of Ukraine’s competence, but of access,” Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna told AFP.She reiterated the president’s appeal to Brussels and said the bloc should do more to help the ex-Soviet country which relies heavily on European backing.
Kiev is deeply reluctant to turn to Russia, whose Sputnik V vaccine has been distributed to several Moscow-friendly countries and was recently approved for use in EU member Hungary.
Moscow backs separatist fighters in east of Ukraine and annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 after a pro-democracy uprising ousted Kiev’s Kremlin-friendly president.
“We are not going to buy the Russian vaccine,” Stefanishyna said, accusing Moscow of using offers of supply as a way to “influence” and “destabilise” Ukraine.– Russia ‘extending its geopolitical clout’ –
Some pro-Russian politicians are lobbying for Sputnik to be introduced in Ukraine as Kremlin critics accuse Moscow of using the vaccine as means of extending its geopolitical clout.
Ukrainian lawmaker Viktor Medvedchuk said in a meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in October that he had “personally tested” Sputnik V and that his wife and son had also got the Russian jab.
President Zelensky has come under fire for his handling of the pandemic and some critics have said systemic corruption was behind a poor government response.
Pro-Western opposition MP Oleksandra Ustinova accused health minister Maksym Stepanov this month of blocking purchases of Indian vaccines for $3 per dose compared to nearly $18 for CoronaVac.
“Ukraine should have fought for direct contracts” with Western vaccine producers, Pavlo Kovtonyuk at the Kyiv School of Economics told AFP.
“Other poor countries have between five and six vaccines in their wallet, and we only have a tiny contract” with the Chinese, he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

How can we function (as) a government with a sick soldier or policeman in your midst?)” he said.According to the President, he will ask vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. to also prioritize the families of the government troops.
“Magpunta ‘yung mga mag-inject sa mga kampo, turukan pati ‘yung mga anak ninyo (Those who will administer the vaccine will go to the camps and vaccinate your children as well),” Duterte said. “So ito lahat, libre ito… para hindi kayo mag-worry (This will be for free so you won’t have to worry),” he added.
Uniformed personnel are the fifth in the priority list of the government’s vaccination program. First are healthcare workers, indigent senior citizens, other senior citizens, and the indigent population.
The government recently procured 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac. An initial 50,000 doses from the Chinese drugmaker is expected to arrive next month.Although Duterte has repeatedly expressed his desire to have the police and the military receive the vaccine first, the government said that the first 50,000 Sinovac vaccines will be given to healthcare workers.

Five people died as a fire tore through a building in the world’s biggest vaccine manufacturing hub in India Thursday, but the company insisted the production of drugs to counter the coronavirus pandemic would continue.
Smoke billows from buildings at India’s Serum Institute in Pune after a fire broke on the campus of the world’s biggest vaccine manufacturer
Rescue workers discovered five bodies in the under-construction building after the blaze at the Serum Institute of India was brought under control, media reports said, with officials in the western city of Pune confirming the toll.
A second, smaller blaze broke out in the same building late Thursday, local media reports said.“Five people have died,” city mayor Murlidhar Mohol told reporters.
TV channels showed thick clouds of grey smoke billowing from the sprawling site, which is responsible for producing millions of doses of the Covishield coronavirus vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
“It is not going to affect production of the Covid-19 vaccine,” a Serum Institute source told AFP, adding the blaze was at a new facility being built on the 100-acre (40-hectare) campus.“We are deeply saddened and offer our deepest condolences to the family members of the departed,” the firm’s CEO Adar Poonawalla tweeted, without offering further details.The founder of Cyrus Poonawalla, Adar’s father, said in a statement that the families of each of the five victims — who were reported to be contract labourers — would be given 2.5 million rupees ($34,200) in compensation.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi added he was “anguished by the loss of lives”.
Both police and the company said the cause of the blaze was not immediately known.The complex where the fire broke out is a few minutes’ drive from the facility where coronavirus vaccines are produced, reports said.
Up to nine buildings are under construction at the complex to enhance Serum’s manufacturing capability, NDTV reported.
– Huge vaccine rollout –
Serum Institute — founded in 1966 by Cyrus Poonawalla — is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, producing 1.5 billion doses a year even before the coronavirus pandemic hit.
It makes vaccines against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella, which are exported to more than 170 countries.
The company has spent nearly a billion dollars in recent years enlarging and improving the giant Pune campus.In January, Indian regulators approved two vaccines — Covishield, produced by the Serum Institute, and Covaxin, made by Indian firm Bharat Biotech.
India began one of the world’s biggest vaccine rollouts on Saturday, aiming to vaccinate 300 million people by July with both Covishield and Covaxin.
Many other countries are also relying on the Serum Institute to supply them with the vaccine.
India exported its first batch Wednesday — to Bhutan and the Maldives — followed by two million doses to Bangladesh and a million to Nepal on Thursday.
The country plans to offer 20 million doses to its South Asian neighbours, with Latin America, Africa and Central Asia next in line.
Serum Institute also plans to supply 200 million doses to Covax, a World Health Organization-backed effort to procure and distribute inoculations to poor countries.
Brazil last weekend was set to send a plane to collect two million doses from Serum but President Jair Bolsonaro said that “political pressure” in India had postponed the flight.
Adar Poonawalla told the Times of India it would supply Brazil in two weeks. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Grace Poe asked on Friday the Department of Health (DOH) to give out free “vaccine passports” to Filipinos who were inoculated against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
“The certificate as proof of vaccination should be at no cost to the recipient,” Poe said in a statement.
“The standard document that our people will carry as their badge of protection that they have been vaccinated should not make them spend extra money because every peso is precious especially during these hard times,” she added.Poe recently filed Senate Bill No. 1994 or her proposed “Vaccine Passport Act” which provides for the issuance of vaccine passport, or the certificate that an individual has received doses of the coronavirus vaccines and completed the course of COVID-19 immunization.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said this in already included in the government’s national vaccination plans.
Under Poe’s bill, the certificate would contain some basic personal information about the vaccinee, the type and purpose of the vaccines administered to the holder, the date of the vaccination, and the persons and institutions that administered the vaccine and other information deemed necessary by concerned authorities.
The measure also includes a provision that prohibits the collection of fees for the issuance, amendment or replacement of a vaccine passport; as well as penalties for offenses for possession of more than one vaccine passport, falsification and forgery.During the Senate Committee of the Whole’s hearing on Friday, Poe said the vaccine passports will be effective in documenting those who have already received doses of the coronavirus vaccines and also in reopening the country’s economy.
“‘Pag naghanap ang ating mga kababayan, kabilang na ang mga OFW, ng trabaho at pinakita nila ‘yon, advantage na ‘yan sa kanila. Alam naman natin ‘yon ang kulang sa atin ngayon na kailangan talagang mas dumami ulit ang mga nagtatrabaho,” she said.
(If our people, including overseas Filipinos, look for jobs and present the passport, that’s an advantage to them already. We all know our challenge with unemployment so we have to boost the number of those who have jobs.)She said the vaccine passport can also be used for other emerging or reemerging infectious diseases in the future.
Poe said the DOH and relevant agencies must keep an organized record and database about the immunization program. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

There would be no strings attached to the much-awaited COVID-19 vaccines that would be donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines, a Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) official said Friday.
“Allow me to convey our assurances that our transactions on the vaccine supply with our global partners, in the bilateral and multilateral levels, do not have strings attached nor is it bearing any quid pro quo for any sovereign territorial consideration,” DFA Assistant Secretary Eric Gerardo Tamayo said in response to Sen. Risa Hontiveros’ question if there are strings attached to the donation at the continuation of the Senate Committee of Whole hearing on the government’s COVID-19 vaccination program.
Tamayo said the vaccines that China would be donating to the Philippines, is an expression of “goodwill.”“We can assure that in the particular case of the donation from China, at no time that China even hinted or tied the vaccine to any consideration,” the DFA official added.
“Vaccine diplomacy, is at best, an expression of good will in solidarity with the Philippines especially during this time of the pandemic,” he said.
Tamayo said that the COVAX facility, a platform that aims to ensure fast, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for people in all countries, is “some form of a donation mechanism” for all nations that are battling the pandemic.
“It maybe noted that the COVAX facility itself is some form of a donation mechanism to lower and middle income countries,” he said.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. had earlier urged senators to set aside their differences on the West Philippine Sea in favor of the global interest “to save humanity.”
“’Yung tinatawag nating differences on the West Philippine Sea should be set aside because this is a global pandemic,” Galvez said.
But Hontiveros rejected Galvez’s statement and urged chief implementers of the national task force for COVID-19 not to compromise the country’s stake on the West Philippine Sea in exchange for the vaccines that China would be donating.
“Just because we are buying Chinese vaccines or accepting their donation, we will be setting aside our rights and our territory in the West Philippine Sea,” Hontiveros said.The senator said it is imperative that the Philippine government protects its strategic interests while pursuing a solution to the pandemic.

Sen. Panfilo M. Lacson has sought simplified proceduresfor the entry of donated COVID-19 vaccines, especially those with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from countries or territories with stringent regulatory agencies.
Senator Panfilo M. Lacson (SENATE OF THE PHILIPPINES / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
Lacson made the call during the third hearing of the Senate, convening as a Committee of the Whole, on the government’s vaccination program Friday.
“This is critical because there are many associations abroad that may donate vaccines to their sister cities in the Philippines. Would it not be more practical to ensure the goods reach the intended recipients directly under strict supervision and guidance by health authorities, instead of coursing the goods through the Department of Health (DoH) and having the DoH distribute them,” he said.
“Besides, many local government units (LGUs) like Baguio City already have their own cold storage facilities for the vaccines, as their local leaders had the foresight to act accordingly. Allowing such donated vaccines to go directly to the LGUs instead of having to go through the logistical requirements of the DoH and Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19 would also avoid the prospect of double handling and additional costs,” he added.
Lacson pointed out the pandemic involves an emergency where authorities cannot afford to have vaccines go through the bureaucratic processes. “Ang purpose ng tanong ko, baka may paraan tayong ayusin natin ang sa halip na iikot pa, idiretso na (The point of my question is that we should find ways to simplify instead of complicate things),” he said.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. thanked Lacson for the recommendation, adding they “saw some of the gaps” in the procedures.
 Galvez said they are open to the idea, particularly of allowing the vaccines to be brought directly to the LGUs to avoid double handling.“Tama kayo, Sir. ‘Yan din ang gagawin namin. Kaya magkakaroon ng time and motion rehearsal para in case capable ang LGU, puwede idiretso para wala nang double handling (You are right, Sir. That is what we will do. We will have a time and motion rehearsal so we can allow donated vaccines to go directly to the LGUs so we don’t have to have double handling),” Galvez told Lacson. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A private hospital in Pasig City on Friday has denied claims on social media that one of its doctors has received a coronavirus vaccine.
The Medical City (TMC) branded as “erroneous” a Twitter post alleging that one of the hospital’s doctors got vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
“We would like to clarify that no such vaccination happened in The Medical City,” the hospital said in an advisory.“In fact, the erroneous tweet was a misunderstanding about enlisting in the Pasig City masterlist of healthcare workers,” it added.
TMC said it is already coordinating with the Pasig City government to ensure the smooth rollout of the vaccine deployment plan.
The hospital added that it is looking forward for the vaccination of its frontline personnel and other employees, with the help of the Department of Health and the local government.
Government officials recently disclosed that initial supplies of COVID-19 vaccines are expected to arrive in the country by February.With this, preparations for the storage and transport of the vaccines have begun, with local government units conducting simulations on their respective vaccination process.
In Pasig, the local government and the health department conducted a tabletop simulation exercise on COVID-19 vaccination on Thursday.
“For the tabletop simulation, members of the Pasig vaccination team were presented with several scenarios that could happen during the pre-vaccination, vaccination, and post-vaccination phases and were asked to prepare action plans on how to address these scenarios,” the city government said.

Duque issued the clarification during today’s third round of public hearing by the Senate Committee of the Whole (COW) on government’s preparation for a planned vaccine rollout in the first quarter of 2022.
Senator Maria Josefa Imelda R. Marcos, a former Ilocos Norte governor, had asked Duque on whether the people could select vaccines other than those made in China and Russia.
Marcos stressed that there is a great anxiety of the people on the current pandemic as one half of the Philippines do not want to be vaccinated.
Duque said those who had refused to be vaccinated first because they do not like the vaccine being used should wait for the arrival of supplies for other kinds of vaccines.
He maintained that vaccines to be used have passed through government screening and are thus safe and good.
Duque said there is no assurance of the supply of vaccines of their choice as many countries are also waiting for available vaccines.
Marcos recalled a statement of Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque that people should not be choosy in the brand of vaccines to be used. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Risa Hontiveros on Friday said the Philippine government should not compromise the country’s claim on the West Philippine Sea in exchange for the COVID-19 vaccines to be given by China.

At the third hearing of the Senate Committee of the Whole on the government’s vaccination program, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez said the Philippines should set aside its differences with China on the West Philippine Sea as the country joins the global community in the race to put a stop to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“In this pandemic, the global interest of the global commons is really to save humanity. All countries rallied to support each other, so that’s the context that we are looking at, but every country wanted to help in our global pandemic,” Galvez said during the hearing.
“Yung tinatawag nating differences on the West Philippine Sea should be set aside because this is a global pandemic,” he said.
But Hontiveros rejected Galvez’ statement and told the committee she is surprised to hear the vaccine czar making such pronouncements.
“Medyo nagulat ako sa sinabi na (I’m a bit surprised when he said) ‘set aside our differences in the West Philippine Sea…Hindi porke’t bibili tayo ng Chinese vaccines o tatanggap tayo ng donasyon at regalo mula sa Tsina ay isasantabi na natin ang ating mga karapatan at teritoryo sa (Just because we are buying Chinese vaccines or accepting their donation, we will be setting aside our rights and our territory in the (West Philippine Sea),” Hontiveros pointed out.
“Up until now, despite the international community collectively rejecting China’s claims on our seas, China remains resolute in asserting unrightful ownership of our territories,” she lamented.
Pressed by Hontiveros, Galvez clarified that the government “will not compromise its stake in the West Philippine Sea.” The vaccine czar insisted that the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) will make sure that the selection of the COVID-19 vaccines that would be used for the government’s massive vaccination plan would be science-based.
But Hontiveros said Galvez should assure the public that we will continue to assert the country’s national interest and that this is not conceded in the name of China’s so-called “vaccine diplomacy.”
“I’m simply asking for a reassurance na hindi natin babawasan ang ating pagtaguyod ng ating national interest sa (that it will not diminish our national interest in the) West Philippine Sea, kahit dito sa usapin sa pagbili ng vaccine sa Tsina (even in the negotiations regarding the procurement of Chinese vaccines),” she said.
She said that the public’s seeming low confidence in China-made vaccines may not only be due to the opaqueness of the data and information on Chinese vaccines, but also because of China’s “vaccine diplomacy” that could force countries to defer to its demands.The senator added that the government should be able to tackle many issues at the same time.
“Our country can continue to occupy several platforms at the same time. Yung platform natin sa global partnership against COVID-19, lalo na through COVAX, at yung platform na napanalunan natin sa The Hague. I don’t think one is exchangeable for the other and we are within our rights na patuloy na i-advance yung ating common at saka national interests on both those platforms,” she stressed.

“Our negotiations with the vaccine makers are based on the guidance by the President, Rodrigo Roa Duterte, which are anchored on the principles of transparency and accountability, and we emphasize that he has no tolerance for corruption,” Galvez said.“We promise to reveal the exact prices and other details of our negotiations in due time as we firm up our agreements,” he added.
Galvez also committed to specifically tell the Senate, even without a committee hearing, the cost of the vaccines developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech.
“Yes, Sir,” he replied after Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon asked if he would be willing to brief the Senate on the prices of Sinovac’s vaccines after the government had inked the supply contract.
He said he will regularly update the senators about their negotiations with the vaccine makers.The National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer made the assurances after meeting Senate President Vicente Sotto III, Senators Panfilo Lacson and Ronald dela Rosa, and Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong last Wednesday.
Sotto was satisfied with Galvez’ promise of “utmost transparency” after seeing documents which, he said, require confidentiality.

Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go (OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / MANILA BULLETIN)
With the guidance of the national government, Go said that this should expedite the process of procuring sufficient supply of safe and effective vaccines for all Filipinos.
“Ako po, sang-ayon ako roon. Kung saan pwedeng mapabilis, basta aprubado lang po ito ng FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Karamihan sa ating LGUs ay may sariling pondo. May mayayamang LGUs na may sariling pondo na naglaan na ng kanilang pondo,’’ Go said. (I agree with that. This will expedite the process as long as it is approved by the FDA. Most of our LGUs have their own funds. Some rich LGUs have already allocated their own funds for the purpose).Go is chairman of the Senate Health and Demography Committee.

“Problema po ngayon ang supply dahil law of supply and demand po ‘yan, habang ang ibang bansa po ay bumibili ng vaccine na doble o more than their population pa po dahil may pera po sila,’’he said. (Supply is a problem now because of the law of supply and demand. Some countries are buying vaccines more than their population because they have the money.)
“Matagal na po silang nakapag-downpayment, mga ilang buwan na po ang nakararaan dahil naninigurado po sila. Tayo, hindi pa tayo nakabayad. ‘Di pa nga napirmahan ang supply agreement eh, sangkatutak na pong away rito o pagdududa,’’ added. (They have already given a downpayment months back because they want to ensure that they get the vaccines. While in our case, we have not made any payment yet. There are a lot of quarrels and suspicions even before we could sign a supply agreement.)Go appealed to the Executive and Legislative branches of the government for greater unity so the country can immediately procure its needed supply and start the rollout of the vaccination program.
He said he spoke with President Rodrigo Duterte and Senate President Vicente Sotto III on how to remove the doubts on the efforts being taken by the government to procure vaccines.“Sabi ni Pangulong Duterte, inatasan niya po si Secretary Galvez na ipakita ang kasunduan kay SP Sotto para matapos na ang pagdududa at haka-haka na kasalukuyang tinatalakay sa Senado,’’ he added. (According to President Duterte, he has already instructed Secretary Galvez to show the agreement to Senate President Sotto to put an end to speculations that the Senate is now looking into.)Go emphasized, however, that the government, through the efforts of Vaccine Czar Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr., is also making sure that any disclosure of information would not adversely affect the ongoing negotiations with vaccine providers.He explained that just like any other country, a standard process is being followed by the government to ensure that the country is able to acquire the right amount of vaccines with the right kind of safety and efficacy, and at the right price.Go said that as a legislator, the Senate also wants to assure the public that there will be transparency in the procurement of vaccines.
To dispel the doubts of the public, Go also assured that he and President Duterte would not allow vaccine procurement to be tainted with corruption.
He said that aside from securing sufficient supply, the safety and efficacy of these vaccines are also being considered in the process to build confidence and allay the fears of the public.
“Kaya nga po sabi ko kay Sec. Galvez na kapag may dumating na vaccine dito unahin siya, not because uunahin ang government officials, but to gain confidence po para sa taumbayan na magtiwala sila sa vaccine na binili ng gobyerno,’’ he added.

Tech colossus Amazon on Wednesday offered to put its vast operation to work helping President Joe Biden get 100 million Americans vaccinated against Covid-19 in the next 100 days.
(AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)
Chief of Amazon’s worldwide consumer business Dave Clark sent a letter to Biden urging that its workers get vaccinated as early as possible and offering to put the company’s resources to work in the broader vaccination effort.
Amazon is the second largest employer in the US with more than 800,000 employees, most of whom are “essential workers” who can’t do their jobs from home, according to a copy of the letter obtained by AFP.The e-commerce giant has seen business boom during the pandemic as people staying home to avoid risk of getting Covid-19 resorted to shopping online and having items delivered.
“We are committed to assisting your administration’s vaccination efforts as we work together to protect our employees and continue to provide essential services during the pandemic,” read the letter.
Amazon has agreements in place with a health care provider to administer vaccines on-site at its facilities, including fulfillment centers, data centers, and Whole Foods Market grocery stores, according to Clark.
“We are prepared to move quickly once vaccines are available.,” Clark said in the letter.“Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact immediately in the fight against Covid-19, and we stand ready to assist you in this effort.”
Uber has also offered logistical assistance. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi last month urged US states to make sure rideshare drivers get quick access to Covid-19 vaccines so they can help with broader distribution plans.
Biden’s top pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci said this week the new president’s goal of seeing 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccine injected within his first 100 days in office is “absolutely” achievable,. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

As part of the preparations for the COVID-19 vaccine deployment, Duque and Galvez inspected three cold storage facilities that “can potentially be used in the first wave of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out.”The cold chain facilities they visited were the First Pioneer Distribution Center of UNILAB located in Biñan City, Laguna; the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City; and the Zuellig Pharma Corporation in Parañaque City.
“Apart from cold chain facilities, the vaccine cluster is also in talks with third-party logistics providers to ensure efficiency of the entire supply chain management of COVID-19 vaccines, from the receipt of vaccines from the COVAX Facility to its deployment,” said Duque.“All of these preparations that we are undertaking are aimed at ensuring that the country is ready to receive, store, and mobilize the COVID-19 vaccines that will come from the COVAX Facility,” he added.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Top officials of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 and the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID) checked three cold storage warehouses that are being considered by the national government in storing millions of vaccine doses that will arrive beginning February.
NTF chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. and IATF head, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, led the inspection of the Zuellig Pharma warehouse in Parañaque City; Unilab Pharma Campus warehouse in Binan City, Laguna; and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) warehouse in Muntinlupa City.
Galvez could not give the exact amount on how much it will cost the national government to pay for the usage of the pharmaceutical companies’ cold storage warehouses.He, however, said that the amount will range from $2 to $2.5 per vaccine dose.
“We will still discuss this with the pharmaceutical companies and the vaccine manufacturers because we’re still in the middle of the negotiations of the supply agreement. But more or less, for each vaccine there is a rough estimate of maybe $2 to $2.5 per dose. That’s our internet calculation,” Galvez said in a press breifing at the Zuellig warehouse in Paranaque City.
According to Galvez, the Zuellig and RITM warehouses will likely be used for the storage of the candidate vaccines of American firms Pfizer and Moderna since they require ultra cold temperatures of -20 and -70 to -80 degrees Centigrade.
Meanwhile, the Unilab warehouse can store vaccines at 2 to 8 degrees Centigrade which are fit for the vaccines of AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson, Novavax, and Sinovac.Around 650 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines can be stored in warehouses with 2 to 8 degrees Centigrade specification; 40 million doses in -20 degrees Centigrade warehouses; and 6.5 million doses in -70 to -80 degrees Centigrade depot, according to Duque.
Duque also expressed confidence that there will be an adequate storage facility that can be used by the government once the vaccines arrive in the country.
Vaccine arrivalsThe earliest date of arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the country will be in February.Galvez said around 50,000 doses of China’s Sinovac will arrive on February 20, and an unspecified number of Pfizer vaccines are also scheduled to be delivered “sometime” in the same month.
Meanwhile, he noted that China will donate around 500,000 doses of Sinovac once its emergency use for application (EUA) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Two other pharmaceutical companies from two countries have also informed Galvez about their intention to donate their vaccines, according to Galvez.
“We will not declare yet because the negotiations are still ongoing. Two countries and two products,” he revealed.Transport
Further, Galvez said he has already negotiated with the vaccine manufacturers as to the transportation of the vaccines to the different vaccination centers.
“Sabi nila (They said that) we just identify the vaccination centers and they will provide the vaccines. Meaning they have service providers. That’s how they will deliver,” the vaccine czar said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

All donated COVID-19 vaccines still require an emergency use authorization (EUA) before it can be used in the country, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Wednesday.“The Food and Drug Administration clarifies that donated COVID-19 vaccines require FDA authorization in the form of Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) prior to use,” the FDA said in a statement.
The agency said that entities that intend to donate vaccines are required to coordinate with the DoH “which will facilitate the acceptance and processing of the donation.““Thereafter, the proposed donation shall be evaluated. The DoH evaluates by considering the relevance of the donated product to the need of the beneficiaries, reliability of the source, shelf life and other relevant criteria,” the FDA said.“If the COVID-19 vaccine for donation does not have an EUA from FDA, then the DoH has to apply for an EUA for the donated lot to ensure the safety, quality, and efficacy of the product being donated,” the FDA said.
The DoH could distribute the products to the intended beneficiaries “only after authorization of the FDA.”“Let it be stressed that the approval of the donated product does not mean free use thereof. FDA’s authorization is limited to the donated lot and carries conditions for use depending on the nature of the donated product,” the agency noted.“DoH, as the donee, is mandated by the FDA to assume full responsibility on the use of the donated product. Thus, if DoH would accept donated COVID-19 vaccines and is granted an EUA, it shall assume full responsibility for said health product,” it added.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that his country will donate 500,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines. However, it is not yet known what vaccine brand will be donated by the Chinese government.

First is to ensure that available vaccines for Filipinos are “safe, effective, and affordable” while the other is securing many would get vaccinated.“She is more than ready to do her part in attaining these goals,” Gutierrez said.The Vice President had earliersaid Filipinos seeing Duterte getting vaccinated would allay public fears, thus, boosting the government’s immunization campaign.

Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto has filed a resolution urging the national government to allow local government units (LGUs) and the private sector to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for their constituents, employees, and dependents.
Senate Ralph Recto (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
Recto filed on Wednesday the proposed Senate Resolution No. 617 which echoes his colleagues’ appeal for the streamlining of the procurement of coronavirus vaccines.
Currently, LGUs and private companies may only purchase vaccines through a tripartite agreement with the national government and pharmaceutical firms.Recto, however, said letting the LGUs and private sector buy their own vaccines is a “regulatory matter” that could be allowed temporarily during a pandemic or a state of national health emergency.
This way, the national government “can focus its vaccination program on those that belong to the priority, vulnerable, and disadvantaged sectors of the population,” he said.
He maintained that if allowed, the LGUs and the private sector should only buy vaccines that have been issued with emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The administration of vaccines to their targeted recipients must also abide by the rules and procedures set by the Department of Health (DOH) and other government agencies.
During the Senate Committee of the Whole hearing on the government’s vaccination plan last January 15, officials said the vaccine makers were not keen about directly negotiating with LGUs and companies as they refused to take responsibility over their products, which are still under clinical trials.They also noted that with an EUA, the vaccines cannot be sold for commercial use so only the national government can procure them from the manufacturers.
National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also said all the vaccines purchased by the LGUs and the private sector will be handled and administered by the DOH.
Companies must also comply with the government’s prioritization rule for the inoculation, with low-income frontliners and essential workers first, before giving the vaccine to their other employees.Executives and their families should not be counted in the vaccine purchase as pharmaceutical firms follow the “equitable access” policy by the World Health Organization.
The Philippines is negotiating with seven pharmaceutical companies to supply the COVID-19 vaccines for its upcoming inoculation program. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go has appealed to President Rodrigo Duterte and Senate President Vicente Sotto III for greater unity in order to ensure transparent and immediate implementation of the national vaccination program against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go (OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“Alang-alang po sa kapakanan ng ating bayan at ng mga mahihirap nating kababayang Pilipino, I am appealing to President Duterte and to Senate President Sotto na magkaisa na lang po tayo para makapag-umpisa na po ng pagbabakuna,’’ Go said. (For the sake of our nation and our poor countrymen, I am appealing to President Duterte and to Senate President (Vicente C.) Sotto (III) to call for unity so we could start the vaccination.)
Moreover, Go announced that President Duterte has already directed Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr. to provide details of the vaccine agreements with the Senate President in order to remove doubts and show transparency in the process being undertaken.“Kausap ko po si Pangulo, at inatasan niya si Secretary Galvez na ipaalam po ang kasunduan kay Senate President Sotto, at nagkausap na rin po kami ni Senate President ukol dito, para magkaroon po ng transparency,’’ he said. (I have talked to the President, and he has instructed Secretary Galvez to explain the agreement to Senate President Sotto. I have also talked to the Senate President about this, in order to have transparency.)
During an ambush interview earlier in the day right after he led the distribution of assistance to public market and talipapa vendors in Plaridel, Bulacan, Go said that he has also requested Secretary Galvez to explain further to the public the processes being undertaken by the government with regard to acquiring vaccines in order to erase doubts and allay fears.
“Para wala nang duda. The more na hindi tayo magkasundo dito, the more maantala, the more matatagalan,’’ he added. (To cast off doubts. If we cannot unite, it will cause further delay.)
Go, however, said that he understands Galvez’s apprehension to share too much information regarding the purchase of the vaccines as it could risk breaching the confidentiality agreements set by vaccine manufacturers, citing Malaysia as an example.He also assured the public that, as a legislator, he would call for transparency on vaccine pricing and procurement to cast off doubts and apprehensions.
Go emphasized that the process must not delay the country from securing enough supply of safe and effective vaccines.
As for the safety and efficacy issues surrounding the vaccines, Go said such matters should be left with medical and health experts to decide.
To further allay fears regarding the COVID-19 vaccination, Go said that his offer to Secretary Galvez and Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III to be inoculated first with the vaccine still stands.
He added that Duterte is also willing to be vaccinated first.
Go also challenged Vice President Leni Robredo to help build the confidence of the public and offer to be vaccinated first. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Richard J. Gordon has sought to expand the pool of vaccinators as the Duterte administration prepares for a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine roll out.
This followed the filing by Gordon of Senate Bill 1987 which sought to expand the pool of vaccinators to include allied health professionals and non-medical professionals and students of such professions trained as vaccinators by the Department of Health (DOH).
This in order to implement the national program for vaccination in times of epidemics, pandemics, national health emergencies and other circumstances authorized by the Secretary of Health, amending for this purpose sections 11 and 12 of Republic Act of No. 2382 also known as ‘’The Medical Act of 1959.’’
‘’With the development of a number of vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 disease, countries are faced with the daunting challenge of administering the vaccine to a record number of people,’’ Gordon said.
Gordon had questioned the capability to conduct the vaccination program with only 617,239 health care workers to participate in the campaign based on the DOH’s data.
The Philippines, according to Gordon, has to vaccinate 50 million to 70 million people to be able to achieve herd immunity.
‘’This is especially challenging since our own DOH has a woeful performance in immunization. It has been failing to meet its immunization targets year by year,’’ he pointed out. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Port of NAIA and other ports of entry have been coordinating with concerned agencies for the prompt release of vaccines once it arrives.
“The Port of NAIA has started last January 13 to 14 its coordination with concerned government agencies, facilities and regulatory agencies aimed at expediting the release of the vaccines upon their arrival,” Customs Commissioner Rey Leonardo Guerrero said in a statement.“Other ports are also in the process of completing their own respective coordinations to discuss protocols, permits and facilities necessary to expedite release of the approved vaccines,” Guerrero added.
The Customs bureau plans to utilize its one-stop shop in processing the influx of vaccines into the country.
According to Guerrero, the use of one-stop shop was proven to be successful during the height of the pandemic when personal protective equipment (PPE) were “released in a systematic and expeditious manner to contain the spread of the deadly virus.”
The one-stop shops are expected to be more efficient this time around with the Port Customer Care Centers (CCC) now fully operational with online systems more accessible to the public.“The Bureau also aims to intensify efforts against illegal and smuggled vaccines. Enhanced data gathering and coordination with law enforcement agencies are underway to crackdown on smuggled vaccines,” the commissioner said.
“Amidst reports of black market vaccines being distributed and administered in the country, the Bureau remains committed in seizing such items and apprehending unscrupulous individuals,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Manila city government launched manilacovid19vaccine.com on December 31, 2020, making it the first local government unit in the country to open such a platform.
Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso earlier said that they want to make the vaccination process voluntary. Vaccines will also be administered for free, regardless if they are residents of the city or not.Those who pre-registered will be included in the priority list for the city government’s vaccination program, below frontline health workers, senior citizens and other vulnerable sectors, and public school teachers.
The city government has secured an initial supply of 800,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses through an agreement with British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The vaccines, that are seen to arrive in a few months, can inoculate around 400,000 people.
Domagoso has expressed intent to purchase more vaccines from other multinational biopharmaceutical companies, provided that they are given approval for use and distribution by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In 2020, the Manila city government earmarked a P250 million budget for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines. The Manila mayor said they can increase the budget to up to P1 billion should they need to buy more vaccines.In preparation for the arrival of the vaccines in the country, the city government has been procuring equipment, conducting training among its personnel, and setting up facilities.
The local government bought several refrigerator units that can store vaccines from different companies. These include five HYC-390 refrigerators, that can store AstraZeneca and/or Sinovac vials; two -25°C biomedical freezers, and two -30°C biomedical freezers, that can store Janssen and/or Moderna vaccine vials; and three -86°C ULT freezers, that can store Pfizer vaccine vials.
At least 50 transport coolers, that will be used for the deployment of the vaccines, are also on the way.These new equipment will be stored in the soon-to-be-launched Manila COVID-19 Vaccine Storage Facility that is being built in Sta. Ana Hospital.
On Tuesday, the government also began its COVID-19 vaccination simulation to train its health workers in handling the vaccine and to identify possible problems that may arise during the vaccination program. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In a meeting with President Duterte and some Cabinet members, Galvez reported they were able to negotiate for a lower vaccine price that brought the country’s total secured supply to 148 million doses from the original 70 million.
“Maipapangako ko po sa ating mga mahal na kababayan na ang lahat ng mga negosasyon at cost, meaning, almost no profit. And then noong kinomputeko po lahat ‘yung ano, ‘yung mga brands, lumalabas po na naka-save po tayo ng 700 million dollars (I can promise to our people that all negotiations were made at cost, meaning, almost no profit. And when I computed the cost of brands, it showed that we saved $700 million),” Galvez said in his remarks aired on state television.As a result of the sale at cost price, Galvez noted that the government was able to buy more doses of vaccines from suppliers.
“‘Yung kanyang offer price, naibaba po natin ng halos kalahati. So kaya po ang nangyari po, iyong dati po natin, ‘yung plano po namin ni Secretary Duque na 70 million doses umangat po, Mr. President, ng 148 million doses (We were able to bring down their price offer to almost half. Secretary Duque and I planned to secure 70 million doses but the figure increased to 148 million doses, Mr. President),” he said.
Galvez also defended the government’s vaccine acquisition efforts as “clean,” rejecting allegations of any irregularity. “‘Yung deal po natin, talaga pong sinasabi po natin sa ating mga tao, sa ating mamamayan na malinis po ‘yung deal natin. At saka po, totoo po kayo na wala po akong hawak na pera (We are telling our people that our deals are clean. It is true that I’m not holding the funds for the purchase),” he said.
Galvez said that he could not divulge the actual price of the vaccines since he is bound by the confidentiality clause in the initial supply deal.On the varying vaccine costs, Galvez said that the price becomes cheaper if supplies are bought in bulk or if a country has its own filling station or even a manufacturing site. The vaccine cost can also be reduced if the buyer gets the supply from the country of the manufacturer instead of paying for their freight expenses.
“Katulad po ng Sinovac, in-offer-an po tayo ng filling station. Pagka filling station po, kalahati po dapat ang babayaran lang natin dahil tayo po ang magfi-finish. Raw materials dadalhin dito, tayo na po ang magfi-filling station (Sinovac offered us a filling station. With a filling station, only half of the cost will be paid because we will do the finishing. They will bring the raw materials and we will handle the filling station),” he said.
Galvez said Thailand could have cheaper vaccines since it has its own manufacturing facility for the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca.Galvez, who has been pressed by some lawmakers to disclose the vaccine cost during a recent Senate hearing, admitted that the companies “warned” him that he signed a non disclosure agreement.
“Anything that you will disclose even when in public and even in the executive session, they have to follow ‘yung CDA.” Unless, they also have to sign the CDA with us,” he said, quoting the manufacturer.
Manila has locked in 25 million vaccine doses from China’s Sinovac Biotech with the 50,000 scheduled to be shipped into the country next month. An additional 30 million doses of Covavax from Serum Institute of India have also been secured. Around 17 million doses from United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca have also been purchased through tripartite deals involving the private sector and local government units.
The first batch of vaccine supplies will start arriving in the country next month. The government intends to give free vaccinations, starting with the medical frontliners, poor and vulnerable sector, and uniformed personnel. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Hospitals and rich people could secure their own coronavirus vaccine supply as long as these are approved by the country’s health authorities, President Duterte said on Monday.

In a taped address on state television, the President said those who can afford it do not have to wait for the government in the vaccine acquisition.
“We are not selling. We are buying for the people, libre (to be given free),” Duterte said about the government’s procurement of vaccines from various manufacturers abroad.“Ngayon, kung kayong mga hospital, mga doktor o kung mayaman, gusto ninyong magbili ng inyo, go ahead. Do not wait for us. If you have the money, buy it. But dumaan ka lang sa FDA (Food and Drug Administration) (Now if the hospitals, the doctors or the rich want to buy supply, go ahead. Do not wait for us. If you have the money, buy it. But you must pass through the FDA),” he added.Duterte said those procuring the vaccines must also get the approval of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, not vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.
“Hindi na dito kay Secretary Galvez. Huwag na sa kanya. Doon kayo sa FDA and finally doon sa Secretary of Health. Iyong pirma ng pinakamataas, importante ‘yan. Iyan ang totoo diyan. So make no mistake about it (Not Secretary Galvez. Go to FDA and finally to the Secretary of Health. The signature of the highest authority is important. That’s the truth so make no mistake about it),” he added.
Duterte made clear that the government has not imposed on any individual or group which vaccine should be purchased. He said “almost everybody” he knows are actually scrambling to buy vaccines developed by Pfizer.
“If you want to follow the experience of Norway, go ahead, nobody would stop you,” he said, alluding to the reported deaths among several elderly people in Norway after taking the Pfizer vaccines.“But this I can tell you, we never prohibited anybody from buying from the government,” he added.The government is under fire over its alleged preference for the coronavirus vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech despite its alleged high cost and low efficacy rate. Around 25 million doses of the Sinovac vaccines have already been secured by the government but the use of the supply will still be subject to the approval of the FDA. Authorities insisted that the vaccine dose cost less than P700 and has shown efficacy in global clinical trials.
Several local government units and the private sector have chosen to purchase 17 million additional vaccine doses from British drugmaker AstraZeneca. An initial 2.6 million doses have been secured in a deal sealed late last year. The supply deals were forged under a tripartite arrangement with the national government.
Some lawmakers have asked the government to let the local officials, as well as private companies, purchase their own supplies without interference to hasten the vaccination of Filipinos.
In a speech last week, the President said the national government would not meddle with the local government units that bought their own vaccine supply for their constituents. Duterte, however, made it clear that the vaccines must still pass the FDA’s scrutiny to check for their safety and efficacy. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

(Xinhua / MANILA BULLETIN)
Vucic made the remarks at Nikola Tesla International Airport after receiving the first batch of one million doses of COVID-19 vaccines produced by China’s pharmaceutical company Sinopharm together with local officials, and the Chinese Ambassador to Serbia Chen Bo in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, on Saturday, according to the People’s Daily.
This batch was said to be the first large-scale arrival of all eight million vaccines Serbia purchased from three different producers.Serbia has also purchased Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine as well as a vaccine jointly developed by the US’ Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech. The country plans to vaccinate 80 percent of its population of seven million, according to the Xinhua News Agency.In an apparent show of confidence in Chinese vaccines, the Serbian president said that he would get vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine, Xinhua reported.
Vucic is not the only foreign president or senior official who is confident in China’s vaccines. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had his first dose of CoronaVac, produced by China’s Sinovac on Thursday, the day Turkey kicked off mass inoculations using CoronaVac after the authorities approved emergency use of the Chinese vaccine, Xinhua reported.
At least 20 countries have purchased COVID-19 vaccines developed by Chinese manufacturers including Sinovac, Sinopharm and Cansino, according to the Global Times’ calculations, with more planning to purchase Chinese vaccines despite some Western media’s intense scrutiny over their efficacy and safety.China has promised to provide its vaccines as a global public good to lead the worldwide recovery from the pandemic and has also revealed on some occasions it will donate vaccines to certain countries.
On Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi concluded a six-day visit to Southeast Asia, during which Wang said China decided to donate a batch of COVID-19 vaccines to Myanmar and the Philippines, continuing to help them combat the novel coronavirus, according to Xinhua.Boosting confidenceTurkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Saturday received the first dose of CoronaVac at the Ankara City Hospital, becoming the latest senior Turkish official to take a jabof Chinese vaccines, local media reported.More than 675,000 health workers have received the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac during the first three days of the country’s vaccination program, Xinhua reported Saturday citing the Turkish Health Ministry.Indonesia and Malaysia have also ordered Sinovac vaccines – 125.5 million and 14 million doses respectively. Thailand and the Philippines are expected to receive millions of doses from China in the coming months, according to Xinhua.
The Indonesian Ambassador to China Djauhari Oratmangun told the Global Times in an exclusive interview on Thursday that “Indonesia’s trust and confidence in Sinovac’s vaccine is reflected in Widodo being the first to receive a jab. We share President Widodo’s sentiments”
The long road ahead
In a BBC report on Friday that many in China believe to be aimed at defaming Chinese vaccines, the reporter asked a Turkish doctor whether he was worried about the vaccine’s efficacy. The answer was an unequivocal “no.” The local doctor also noted that clinical trials of the vaccine in Turkey showed more than 90 percent efficacy.
The doctor also admitted in the report that a level of distrust regarding Chinese vaccines is common around the world, maybe even reflecting the image of Chinese products in most people’s eyes. “Unfortunately, this is true,” said a Chinese vaccine industry insider reached by the Global Times.
The pandemic has put Chinese vaccines under global scrutiny. Large numbers of overseas purchases have boosted confidence in them. But insiders noted that there is a long road ahead for them to explore the international market, especially given continuous politicization of the vaccines amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a great opportunity for Chinese vaccine producers but the challenge remains huge, the insider noted.Chinese vaccine producers have mostly focused on the domestic market before the COVID-19 pandemic and most of them barely export their products as the domestic market is big enough, a vaccine expert based in Changchun, Northeast China’s Jilin Province, told the Global Times on Sunday under the condition of anonymity.The international vaccine market has been mostly dominated by the big four major pharmaceutical companies, namely Pfizer, Merck, GSK and Sanofi, so there is little incentive or market space to encourage Chinese companies to branch out. 
The big four major producers occupy about 90 percent of the international vaccine market, according to a report from Guangfa Securities in March 2020.“But I can say that Chinese vaccines have no questions,” said the anonymous expert, noting that it will take time to establish a reputation in the international market. Chinese companies can treat the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to gradually increase international cooperation.Smear from the Western media outlets, especially after Brazilian authorities revealed a 50.4 percent efficacy rate in CoronaVac’s late-stage trials, is also a huge hurdle that prevents many people in the West from viewing Chinese vaccines in an objective and scientific way, Chinese observers noted.
While hyping up doubt over CoronaVac’s late-stage data, mainstream English-language media mentioned little about the deaths of 23 elderly Norwegian people after they were vaccinated with Pfizer vaccines, as if those media outlets had already reached a consensus to downplay the incident.
Yang Xiaoming, CEO of leading Chinese vaccine producer Sinopharm’s subsidiary China National Biotec Group (CNBG), previously told the Global Times that CNBG had never conducted such large-scale international Phase III clinical trials in cooperation with so many countries before.
CNBG is conducting Phase III clinical trials on two of its inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in 10 countries covering more than 50,000 volunteers, according to Yang.
“We have encountered many difficulties in communication and understanding local cultures and policies,” Yang said, noting that the solution to these difficulties is nothing else but communication.The anonymous expert suggests that Chinese vaccine companies can try to cooperate with Western countries like the US and the EU. It would be easier for the world to accept Chinese vaccines if they obtain certificates from authorities in these nations. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Global gaps in access to COVID19 vaccines are raising concerns that the continued spread of the coronavirus will breed more dangerous versions of the pathogen, weakening medical weapons and further crippling economies.
In a race to catch up with emerging coronavirus variants, wealthy countries are already benefiting from potent vaccines.

While the US, Britain and European Union have given citizens about 24 million doses so far – more than half of the shots administered globally – vast numbers of countries have yet to begin their campaigns.Disparities in immunity pose a threat to both have and have-not states.
Giving the coronavirus an opportunity to advance and generate new mutants would have significant economic and public-health consequences, adding to the pain as the death toll surpasses 2 million.
Growth forecast
“We cannot leave parts of the world without access to vaccines because it’s just going to come back to us,” said Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at health research foundation Wellcome.
“That puts everyone around the world at risk.”Countries are relying on effective immunizations to save lives and revive businesses.
The World Bank’s projection for 4% growth this year depends on widespread deployment of vaccines.
Surging COVID cases and a delay to the delivery of inoculations, however, could limit expansion to just 1.6%.High-income countries have secured 85% of Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine and all of Moderna Inc.’s, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.
Much of the world will be counting on U.K. drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, whose vaccine is cheaper and easier to distribute, along with other manufacturers such as China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.
Of 42 countries rolling out COVID vaccines as of Jan. 8, 36 were high income countries and the rest were middle-income, according to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
A growing number of countries are pursuing their own supply deals, in addition to participating in a global collaboration known as Covax.
Future Mutants
Urgency is increasing as the pandemic extends into a second year.New variants that surfaced in the UK, South Africa and Brazil appear to spread significantly faster than earlier versions.
Just in the past month, a “new dimension of risk has opened up for the world,” said Rajeev Venkayya, president of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s vaccines business.
Reducing deaths and illnesses has been seen as the main driver of delivering vaccines rapidly, said Venkayya, who worked in the George W. Bush administration to develop a US pandemic flu plan and directed vaccine delivery for the Gates Foundation.
“We now understand it’s also very, very important to control transmission,” he said, “not just to protect those most vulnerable populations, but also to reduce the evolutionary risk associated with this virus.”
While there’s no evidence to suggest the current crop of vaccines are ineffective against those variants, future mutants may be less responsive, Wellcome’s Weller said.
Drugmakers say they could tweak their shots to counter new variants within weeks if needed.
The likelihood that such adaptations will be necessary has increased, Venkayya said.
“The longer the virus is allowed to continue in different parts of the world where we don’t have a vaccine,” said Anna Marriott, health policy adviser at the anti-poverty group Oxfam, “the greater the danger of new variants that could be more aggressive, more virulent or transmissible.”
COVID shots have been tested for their ability to prevent symptoms, not transmission.
Still, their performance in clinical trials gives an indication of how effective they might be against spread.
Effectiveness Gap
The rollout of shots from PfizerBioNTech SE and Moderna that achieved efficacy levels of about 95% has raised questions about whether everyone will have access to such high levels of protection.
“The gap isn’t just about access to vaccines,” said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.
“It’s also about access to effective vaccines.” One of the shots lower- and middle-income countries are relying on, from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, sparked worries in Australia that it may not be effective enough to generate herd immunity.
Health authorities there, however, said they believe it will be comparable to the Pfizer and Moderna shots in preventing people from getting seriously ill.
The vaccine developed by the UK partners, introduced in the country earlier this month, delivered an average efficacy rate of 70%.
That appeared to climb to 80% with a longer gap between doses, based on limited data available, according to regulators.
Lengthening that period to as many as three months from one allows more people to get protected faster, while data show the level of antibodies also increases, an AstraZeneca spokesman said.
“An optimized regimen which allows the vaccination of many more people upfront, together with a robust supply chain, means we can have a real impact on the pandemic,” he said in an email.
Four vastly differing protection rates have been released on Sinovac’s shot, ranging from about 50% to more than 90%.
The Chinese developer said the lower number seen in a trial in Brazil is due to participants being medical workers facing a high risk of contracting COVID.
“Despite the difference in efficacy rate, they all point to the vaccine’s ability for protection, especially against mid- and severe disease,” Sinovac said.
While the picture is still coming into focus, cleared vaccines are likely to be similarly effective in preventing serious sickness and death, said Takeda’s Venkayya.
Where they could diverge is on side effects, the duration of protection and impact on transmission, an even more critical factor in light of new variants, he said.
Even shots with a lower efficacy level could have a considerable impact.
US regulators set a 50% threshold for deeming a candidate effective. But they would require a higher percentage of people willing to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, Huang said.
If less-effective vaccines are distributed to emerging markets, it could have significant economic implications, too, and “sharpen differences in pandemic outcomes across countries,” Justin-Damien Guenette, a senior economist at the World Bank, wrote in an email.
Many countries are depending on Covax, which aims to deploy vaccines equitably to every corner of the planet.
Yet not all lower- and middle-income nations are waiting for a lifeline.
Countries such as South Africa and Malaysia are also pursuing their own supply deals through direct talks with manufacturers, and some regions are set to receive Pfizer’s vaccine as well.
‘Losing Patience’
“There seem to be indications that countries are losing patience,” said Huang of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Covax has secured access to almost 2 billion doses, with deliveries due to begin in the first quarter, and set a goal of vaccinating up to a fifth of countries’ populations by the end of the year.
That’s far short of the levels of two-thirds or more that many nations are targeting. Some may not get vaccines until 2024, researchers estimate.
The mobilization is ramping up. India, a nation of more than 1.3 billion people, kicked off a massive inoculation drive on Saturday, an effort expected to encounter challenges as it extends into rural areas.
Vaccine advocates have called on rich countries to share while pushing companies to scale up manufacturing capacity.
While it’s early, the trends are concerning, Venkayya said.
“Success is defined as getting vaccines to people everywhere,” he said, “and we’re not yet successful in that endeavor.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Countries around the world stepped up their coronavirus vaccine campaigns Monday, with Russia offering jabs to all citizens, while an independent probe found fault with the early response to the pandemic.
Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and Beijing could have acted faster when Covid-19 first surfaced in China a year ago, the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response concluded in a report.
It added that countries where the virus was likely to spread should have put containment measures in place immediately.
With the global death toll now past two million, many governments are betting on mass vaccination to throttle the pandemic, while tightening lockdown measures at the same time.
Nationwide rollouts from Brazil to Azerbaijan were getting underway Monday, while Britain and France were widening inoculations to all elderly people.In Russia, the government welcomed all citizens to sign up for the homegrown Sputnik V jab — but while it was widely available in Moscow, many regions reported receiving only between 5,000 and 15,000 doses in the country of 146 million.
India’s campaign was also facing teething problems as it emerged that almost a third of the 300,000 people invited for a shot on the opening day didn’t turn up.“These are initial days and we understand people are waiting to see how the procedure pans out,” said Suneela Garg, a member of the coronavirus task force for New Delhi.
“These numbers will go up as confidence is strengthened. And for that, we have to tackle misinformation.”
– ‘Gift from God’ –
Authorities worldwide have been mounting public information campaigns to address concerns over vaccine safety, and in the face of powerful online anti-vax movements.After 33 elderly people who had received a first dose died in Norway, authorities there stressed there was no proven link between the jabs and the deaths. They recommended, however, that doctors consider patients’ frailty before immunising them.
For Syrian refugee Fatima Ali, receiving her vaccination was cause for tears of joy.“It’s a gift from God,” the 70-year-old said as she was vaccinated outside a clinic in Mafraq, Jordan.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned rich countries against hogging doses while the poorest suffer, blasting vaccine manufacturers for chasing regulatory approvals there rather than seeking global approval.
“I need to be blunt. The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure,” Tedros said. “And the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world’s poorest countries.”Israel, praised for one of the world’s fastest rollouts, has secured a significant stock of vaccines partly by pledging to quickly share data on its impact with Pfizer, according to an agreement with the drug company seen by AFP.
– Bleak times for travel economy –
Despite the mass immunisation campaigns now under way, spiralling infection rates have left governments reliant on continuing curbs on people’s daily lives.Nearly three million people in China’s northeastern Jilin province were put under lockdown Monday after a surge in cases, while Malawi introduced an overnight curfew.
Globally, travel remains at a trickle of its usual pace — and there were signs Monday of the price being paid by companies and countries reliant on tourism.Disneyland Paris — Europe’s biggest tourist attraction — announced it was delaying its reopening until April, while train operator Eurostar made a desperate plea for British state support.
“Without additional funding from government there is a real risk to the survival of Eurostar,” the cross-Channel service said.
Soaring public debt in Greece, Spain and Italy was on the agenda at eurozone finance ministers’ talks Monday — with the highly tourist-dependent nature of these economies compounding the problem.
Smaller business owners are also fed up after months of restrictions that have left them struggling for survival.
In Poland there had been plans for a major campaign of civil disobedience in tourist-reliant ski resorts, but while some restaurants reopened in defiance of the rules, most businesses ultimately decided to stay shut.In Japan meanwhile, there are growing doubts on whether the postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympics can go ahead in July.
The international extravaganza is hugely dependent on travel, but Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he was committed to holding the Games as “proof of mankind’s victory over the virus”.
– UK quarantines travellers –
In just one example of the remaining hurdles facing travellers, Britain imposed a 10-day isolation on all arrivals, who will have to provide a negative Covid test taken at most 72 hours before departure.
The UK is battling an apparently highly infectious strain of the coronavirus that emerged late last year — one of several potent new variants causing concern, along with others first detected in South Africa and Brazil.
Despite the doom and gloom, in Milan fashionistas were dreaming of life beyond Covid, with a digital edition of Men’s Fashion Week offering up colourful collections for Winter 2021.
Many labels looked to the new norms of working-from-home for inspiration, however, with both Fendi and Zegna showcasing coats resembling dressing gowns. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Fatima Negrini, who is due to turn 109 on June 3, received the jab on Monday along with other residents of the Anni Azzurri San Faustino care home in Milan, a spokesman told AFP.
“The arrival of the vaccine for her and all guests and staff… represents a moment of great happiness and a first step towards a return to peaceful everyday life inside the facility,” said Matteo Tessarollo.When Negrini shook off the virus last year, the Corriere della Sera newspaper quoted her as saying: “God forgot about me.”
Italy began coronavirus vaccinations on December 27 and has since inoculated 1.15 million people.
On Monday, a vaccine was also given to Sami Modiano, a 90-year-old Holocaust survivor from Rome, according to regional president and leader of the centre-left Democratic Party Nicola Zingaretti.

Whether rich or poor, all local government units will receive from the national government COVID-19 vaccines that will cover 70 percent of their population, with the more affluent getting the advantage of inoculating 100 percent of local population.
Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 (NTF AGAINST COVID-19 / MANILA BULLETIN)
Thus, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez stressed that LGUs, mostly in Metro Manila, that have money to spare to purchase vaccines for their constituents will have a bigger chance of inoculating a larger part of their population.
Nearly all LGUs in Metro Manila, led by the cities of Quezon, Makati, Manila, Navotas, Pasig and Caloocan, are ready to spend to purchase vaccines that would add to their 70 percent share from the national government.These LGUs have entered into tripartite procurement agreements whereby the national government would stand as the middleman in vaccine procurement with pharmaceutical firms such as Astra-Zeneca.
“The arrangement is that in case they (LGUs) opted to buy the vaccine, we will take care of the supplies and how to administer these,” Galvez told the House Committee on Health during the briefing on the national vaccination roadmap.Also thechief implementer of the government’s anti- COVID 19 action plan, Galvez said many LGUs have decided to use their own budget to increase the number of their constituents who will be protected from the dreaded coronavirus disease.
“They want to augment their supply because they want to immediately revive their economy and ensure better protection for their people,’ he said.
Also during the hearing, Marinduque Governor and League of Provinces of the Philippines president Presbitero Velasco assured Galvez that the country’s provinces and LGUs are in full support of the national government’s vaccination program.However, Velasco sought an assurance from Galvez that the LGUs that were able to procure their own supply will still be allowed to access the state-procured vaccine supply.Velasco, father of Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, also stressed that LGUs want an assurance from the government that they will be allowed to procure directly vaccines from their respective supliers.“Of course it has to pass through the national government, but we want clear authority to negotiate directly with the suppliers,” said Velasco, a retired Supreme Court associate justice.Earlier, Deputy Speaker and Cagayan de Oro City Rep. Rufus Rodriguez filed House Resolution No. 1460 calling on the national government to grant LGUs the authority to directly procure their vaccines from manufacturers.“Coordinated proper vaccination programs by the LGUs will significantly aid the government in its pursuit to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, especially regaining some semblance of normalcy with businesses bouncing back and ultimately placing the economy well on its way back to recovery,” said Rodriguez.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Angara, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, reiterated that the information on the various prices of vaccines, particularly that of China’s Sinovac Biotech, were provided by the DOH to his office and was meant as a guide for senators who were inquiring about details of the vaccines during the plenary debates last November 2020.
“Sen. Angara has neither claimed that he was the source of the data nor said anything about the accuracy of the said prices then and now,” Angara’s office said in a statement.
“What was presented during the plenary debates and subsequently quoted in various social media posts was a straightforward citation of the data provided by the DOH to the Office of Sen. Angara,” the statement also read.
Angara’s office stressed the proper attribution should be with the DOH and not from the senator.
“The Senator does not claim to be an expert on the issue and does not have any knowledge about the actual cost of the vaccines other than what was provided to him by the DOH last November,” they also said.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque had branded as “fake news” allegations that the cost of the COVID-19 vaccines from China’s Sinovac Biotech that would be sold to the Philippines costs P3,600.
According to Roque, the price of Sinovac vaccines would only cost around P650, similar to other countries.
Earlier, Angara’s office shared data showing that COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac cost P3, 629 for two doses.
Senators are questioning the government’s preference to procure the Chinese-made vaccines, noting its low efficacy rate and lack of peer-reviews from the medical community. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Some refrigeration units that will be used to store coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in Manila have arrived on Monday.
Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso said that, although it may take a few months before the vaccines arrive in the country, the city has to prepare for it with the necessary equipment.
“In the meantime, we are preparing other facilities, our logistic capabilities, process of deployment, and future clients on top of medical frontliners and senior citizens,” he told reporters.“What we did, in our own little way, is to buy all types of freezers and refrigerators for all types of vaccines,” he added.
Among some of the equipment that arrived are five refrigerator HYC-390, that can store AstraZeneca and/or Sinovac vials; two -25°C biomedical freezers and two -30°C biomedical freezers, that can store Janssen and/or Moderna vaccine vials.Domagoso said three -86°C ULT freezers, that can store Pfizer vaccine vials, are expected to arrive next week.
Each refrigeration unit is equipped with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to ensure the integrity of the vaccines. The equipment will be placed inside the Manila COVID-19 Vaccine Storage Facility at the Sta. Ana Hospital, which is also equipped with a power generator.
The Manila mayor said they are set to inaugurate the storage facility by the end of January.The city government also bought 50 transport coolers that will be used for the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines.
The new equipment costed the city government around P9 million, Domagoso said.
Earlier, the Manila city government entered into an agreement with British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for the advance purchase of 800,000 COVID-19 vaccines.
Domagoso has also expressed intent to buy vaccines from other biopharmaceutical companies to give the public more options.“Basta, sa Maynila, pwede choosy (It’s okay to be choosy in Manila),” he quipped.Frontline health workers, senior citizens and other vulnerable sectors, and public school teachers will be prioritized in the city’s COVID-19 vaccination program.
Then, the city government will proceed to vaccinate those who pre-registered and reserved their slots for the vaccine at the manilacovid19vaccine.com website.
The local chief executive said at least 72,000 residents have already registered on the said platform.Domagoso said they are aiming to inoculate up to 60 percent of the city’s population in the next two quarters. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The selection of coronavirus vaccines should not be compared to choosing laundry soap as suggested by a comedian due to its limited global supply, according to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque.

Unlike detergent soaps that have an abundant market supply, Roque explained the Philippines and other developing countries are scrambling to secure vaccines from the remaining 18 percent global vaccine supply. The bulk of the coronavirus vaccines in the market, he added, has been secured by wealthy nations.
Roque made the statement after comedian Vice Ganda commented that if Filipinos are choosy with laundry soap, they are also expected to be more selective when it comes to vaccines that will be injected into their body.“Dahil sa limitadong supply ng mga bakuna, hinditayo makakapili ng isa o dalawang brand (Because of the limited supply of the vaccines, we cannot one or two brands),” Roque said during a televised press briefing Monday.
“Alam ninyo, mali naman ikukumpara ang bakuna sa sabon nasa panlaba. Ang katunayan po, wala naman supply na ganoon kadami. Nag-aagawan nga tayo sa 18 percent na available na supply (You know it is wrong to compare the vaccines with laundry soap. In fact, there is no such huge supply. We are scrambling for the 18 percent of the available supply),” he added.
According to Roque, the public should trust health experts, not comedians, in determining the safety and efficacy of the vaccines developed to protect against the coronavirus illness. He did not mention any name of comedian in his remarks.
“Hindi lang naman ito gagamitin para sa damit kaya nga hindi lang isa , hindi lang dalawa, kung hindi tatlong grupo pa ng eksperto ang magsusuri kung ang mga bakuna ay ligtas at epektibo (Also, this will not be used for clothes. That’s why there are three groups of experts, not just one or two, to study if the vaccines are safe and effective),” he said.“Kung hindi naman pagtitiwalaan ang experts na 3 batches of experts na magsasabi na puwede nating gamitin ‘yan at magiging basehanpara mag-issue ang FDA (Food and Drug Administration) ng EUA (emergency use authorization), sino pagkakatiwalaan? Siguro po hindi ang mga komedyante (If we do not trust the word of three batches of experts who can say we can use the vaccines and can be the basis if the FDA will issue an EUA, who will we trust? Maybe not the comedians),” he added.
Roque assured the public that the government would only administer COVID vaccines that are proven safe and effective by health authorities.“Uulitin ko po, supply and demand. kung ano ang napatunayan na ligtas at epektibo, ito ang gagamitin natin dahil ang nais natin ay masalba ang pinakamaramingkababayan natin sa lalong mabilis na panahon (I repeat, it’s about supply and demand. We will use what has been proven safe and effective because we want to save as many people as soon as possible),” he said.Last week, Vice Ganda reacted to Roque’s pronouncement that people could not choose the brand of coronavirus vaccines to be given free by the government. Roque earlier said the beneficiary in the priority list who declines the free vaccine will have to be place on the back of the line to wait for their turn.
“Sa sabong panlaba nga choosy tayo e sa bakuna pa kaya. Ano to basta may maisaksak lang?! Vaklang twoooaahhh!!!” @vicegandako tweeted on Jan. 12.
The government aims to secure 148 million vaccine doses to vaccinate around 70 million people to achieve herd immunity. So far, the government has negotiated 30 million vaccines doses from Serum Institute of India and 25 million doses from China’s Sinovac BioTech. Around 20 million doses from AstraZeneca have been secured by the private sector and local government units.
A limited supply of Pfizer’s vaccine through the COVAX facility, a global initiative to ensure equitable access to the vaccine, is expected to arrive next month. Around 50,000 vaccines from Sinovac are also scheduled to be shipped in February. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The planned issuance of a vaccine passport for people who have been inoculated against the coronavirus could be the key to a return to normal life, Malacañang said Monday.

As the government ramps up the acquisition of coronavirus vaccines from foreign suppliers, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the vaccine passports would help facilitate safe mobility among those who have received the shot.
“DOH (Department of Health) po ang magi-isyu niyan (The DOH will issue the vaccine passports),” Roque said over “Unang Hirit” program on GMA-7 Monday.“At importante po iyong passport na iyan kasi iyan ang magiging susi doon sa ating tinatawag na mobility, para tayo makaikot, makabiyahe, makapag-resume ng ating normal na buhay bago tumama ang pandemic (The passport is important because that will serve as the key to our mobility so we can go around, travel, return to our normal life before the pandemic hit),” he added.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire had earlier announced the government’s planned establishment of a data registry for all vaccine recipients. A QR code will be issued to show information about the vaccinated person.
She said the vaccine passports, which will be proof that a person has taken the shot, would likely be part of the protocol for border control of countries around the globe.
The government has secured supplies of millions of coronavirus vaccines with the initial shipment expected to arrive next month.The first COVID vaccine doses to be shipped will come from American drugmaker Pfizer and China’s Sinovac.Of the pending applications, local drug regulators have so far approved the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer vaccines in the country.The Palace has repeatedly defended the government’s purchase of the Chinese-made vaccines in the wake of criticisms about its supposed high cost and poor efficacy rate.
Roque insisted that the Sinovac vaccines cost around P650 similar to the price estimated in Indonesia, contrary to reports about it being expensive.The government could not yet disclose the exact amount of the vaccines due to the confidentiality clause until the supply agreement is signed, he added.
Asked if the government could still cancel the Sinovac order,Roque said: “Anything is possible.”
He maintained though that President Duterte wants to save as many people as possible with the help of the vaccines especially in the face of the new coronavirus variant.
He said the immunization drive using Sinovac vaccines will push through if it gets an approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“Ang dahilan po para hindi siya matuloy ay kung hindi siya bibigyan ng approval ng FDA (The only reason it will not push through is if it does not get the approval from FDA),” he said.“Kapag binigyan ng approval ng FDA, ang Presidente na ang nagsabi, tabla-tabla po iyan, pare-pareho iyan in terms if iyong safety at saka iyong pagiging epektibo (Once it secures FDA approval, the President has said the vaccines are on equal footing.

Norway expressed increasing concern about the safety of the Pfizer Inc. vaccine on elderly people with serious underlying health conditions after raising an estimate of the number who died after receiving inoculations to 29.
(Daniel Schludi / UNSPLASH / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
The latest figure adds six to the number of known fatalities in Norway, and lowers the age group thought to be affected to 75 from 80. While it’s unclear exactly when the deaths occurred, Norway has given at least one dose to about 42,000 people and focused on those considered most at risk if they contract the virus, including the elderly.
Until Friday, the vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech SE was the only one available in Norway, and “all deaths are thus linked to this vaccine,” the Norwegian Medicines Agency said in a written response to Bloomberg on Saturday.“There are 13 deaths that have been assessed, and we are aware of another 16 deaths that are currently being assessed,” the agency said. All the reported deaths related to “elderly people with serious basic disorders,” it said. “Most people have experienced the expected side effects of the vaccine, such as nausea and vomiting, fever, local reactions at the injection site, and worsening of their underlying condition.”
Official reports of allergic reactions have been rare as governments rush to roll out vaccines to try to contain the global pandemic. US authorities reported 21 cases of severe allergic reactions from Dec. 14-23 after administration of about 1.9 million initial doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
The first Europe-wide safety report on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is due to be published at the end of January.
Australia’s concern
Australia, which has an agreement for 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, is seeking urgent information on the issue from the producer, health authorities and Norway’s government, Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday.Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration will seek “additional information, both from the company, but also from the Norwegian medical regulator,” Hunt said. Australia’s foreign ministry will also contact its counterpart in Norway on the issue.
Norway’s experience doesn’t mean that younger, healthier people should avoid being vaccinated. But it’s an early indication of what to watch as countries begin to issue safety monitoring reports on the vaccines. Emer Cooke, the new head of the European Medicines Agency, has said tracking the safety of COVID vaccines, especially those relying on novel technologies such as messenger RNA, would be one of the biggest challenges once shots are rolled out widely.
Though the two COVID-19 vaccines approved so far in Europe were tested in tens of thousands of people — including volunteers in their late 80s and 90s — the average trial participant was in his or her early 50s. The first people to be immunized in many places have been older than that as countries rush to inoculate nursing-home residents at high risk from the virus.The findings have prompted Norway to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines may be too risky for the very old and terminally ill, the most cautious statement yet from a European health authority.
The Norwegian Institute of Public Health judges that “for those with the most severe frailty, even relatively mild vaccine side effects can have serious consequences. For those who have a very short remaining life span anyway, the benefit of the vaccine may be marginal or irrelevant.”
Pfizer and BioNTech are working with the Norwegian regulator to investigate the deaths in Norway, Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement. The agency found that “the number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in
line with expectations,” Pfizer said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Archdiocese of Manila Apostolic Administrator Bishop Broderick Pabillo is leaving it to Manila priests to decide on whether to be vaccinated or not against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo (CBCP NEWS / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“That is their own decision,” he said in an interview Monday.
Pabillo believes that there are others who should be given priority.
“Priority should be given to frontliners and the vulnerable, instead of priests,” he said.
Catholic prelates said the same thing when they were offered the vaccine.
“Since we are considered frontliners — bishops and priests — someone offered to the NCR bishops and priests a vaccine and it will be sponsored,” Cubao Bishop Honesto Ongtioco said.
“We are very grateful for the offer but we said we would be happy if it will be given to the poor first since they have no means to pay,” he added.
Under the government’s priority list for the COVID-19 vaccination program, the first to receive the vaccines will be frontline health workers, senior citizens, indigent population, and uniformed personnel.
They will be followed by teachers and school workers, government workers, “essential workers” in agriculture, the food industry, transportation, and tourism, sociodemographic groups in significantly higher risk areas, overseas Filipino workers, the remaining workforce, and students.

India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive had a successful start with more than 224,000 people receiving their first jabs and just three people hospitalised for experiencing side effects, the health ministry said Sunday, as reports emerged about concerns over a homegrown vaccine.
India is aiming to vaccinate 300 million people against Covid-19 by July
Authorities have given emergency-use approval for two jabs — “Covishield”, a version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and the Indian-made “Covaxin”, which has yet to complete its Phase 3 trials.The government plans to immunise some 300 million people out of its population of 1.3 billion by July.
Frontline workers such as hospital staff, people over 50 and those deemed to be at high risk due to pre-existing medical conditions are on the shortlist to receive the vaccines.
“We have got encouraging and satisfactory feedback results on the first day,” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan told his state counterparts on Saturday.
“This vaccine will indeed be a ‘Sanjeevani’ (life saver)” in the fight against the virus, he added.
The health ministry said Sunday that 447 people reported experiencing side effects — mostly fever, headache and nausea — after being given their shot, with three people admitted to hospital.
Two have already been discharged, the ministry added.
Just six states carried out vaccinations on Sunday, the second day of the rollout. The government has advised local authorities to limit inoculations to four days a week so as to reduce disruptions to routine health services.
– Vaccine fears –
The updated vaccination figures came as a doctors’ representative body at the Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in New Delhi wrote a letter asking for the Covishield vaccine to be supplied instead of Covaxin.
“The residents are a bit apprehensive about the lack of complete trial in case of Covaxin and might not participate in huge numbers thus defeating the purpose of vaccination,” said the letter addressing the hospital’s medical superintendent, seen by AFP.
“We request you to vaccinate us with Covishield, which has completed all stages of trial before its rollout.”
Pathologist Arvind Ahuja told AFP at the hospital on Saturday that he shared some of the concerns.
“I hope when the data comes out, it is good. Ideally, they should have waited for one month at least as then we would have known better about its efficacy,” the 45-year-old said.
Vaccine hesitancy has emerged as a major concern, with a recent survey of 18,000 people across India finding that 69 percent were in no rush to get a shot.
Leading scientists and doctors have called on authorities to release efficacy data about Covaxin to boost confidence about the vaccine.
Covaxin recipients on Saturday had to sign a consent form that stated its “clinical efficacy… is yet to be established”.
Officials had hoped to inoculate 300,000 people on Saturday but said glitches with an app used to coordinate and monitor the process meant not all potential recipients were alerted.
India has the world’s second-largest known caseload with more than 10.5 million coronavirus infections and over 152,000 deaths so far. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Brazil’s health regulator gave emergency approval Sunday for two coronavirus vaccines, kicking off a mass inoculation campaign amid a devastating second epidemic wave killing over 1,000 people in the vast South American nation daily.
Vanusa Costa Santos, a member of the Kaimbe indigenous tribe, was among the first to receive the CoronaVac jab after its approval by Brazil’s health regulator Sunday
Monica Calazans, a 54-year-old nurse in Sao Paulo became the first person in Brazil to receive the Chinese CoronaVac jab after the Anvisa watchdog’s highly-anticipated ruling.
Anvisa also approved AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s Covishield shot for use in the nation whose Covid-19 death toll now exceeds 209,000 — surpassed only by the United States.Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello announced the government would start distributing vaccines to all 27 states on Monday for a national inoculation campaign to start Wednesday.
As Anvisa met in the capital Brasilia, activists gathered outside to inflate a larger-than-life effigy of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, his hands dripping with metaphorical blood.
Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the virus and railed against lockdowns, face masks and other “hysteria,” has come under renewed fire for his handling of the epidemic after a fresh outbreak that has hit the northern Amazonas state particularly hard.
While many countries have already started vaccination drives, including some among its neighbors, Brazil with its population of some 213 million has lagged behind.And CoronaVac has been dragged into a political standoff between Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly tried to discredit it, and Sao Paulo Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, a defender.
Doria attended the ceremonial first vaccination Sunday of Calazans at an event that also saw Vanusa Costa Santos, a member of the Kaimbe tribe, receive a jab.
Pazuello denounced the Sao Paulo event as a “marketing ploy” by Bolsonaro’s rival.
– No more hospital beds –Health workers, people older than 75, residents of old age homes and indigenous populations will be the first to be vaccinated once the national campaign starts in earnest. Both vaccines require two doses.
CoronaVac is produced by China’s Sinovac firm with the Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo. It has been approved for emergency use in China, Indonesia and Turkey.
The AstraZeneca jab is produced by the Serum Institute in India, has been approved in Britain, Argentina and India, and is under review by the European Union.
Sao Paulo already has six million doses of the CoronaVac vaccine, and the health ministry announced this month it had signed a deal with Butantan to produce 100 million more.
Earlier this month, Brazil said the Chinese vaccine had been shown to be 50 percent effective in preventing infection with the virus.As for the Oxford vaccine, results published in December found it was between 62 percent and 90 percent effective, depending on the dosage.Both appear to fall short of the more than 90 percent effectiveness reported for vaccines developed by US pharmaceutical firms Pfizer and Moderna.
Last week, Bolsonaro announced a commercial plane would be sent to India to collect two million doses of Covishield, though New Delhi, which has just launched its own mass inoculation campaign, has yet to give the green light.
Sunday’s approval came amid a devastating second wave of the Covid-19 epidemic that has seen hospitals in the Amazon rainforest city of Manaus running out of beds and life-saving oxygen.
With hospitalizations reaching even higher levels than during the first wave, Manaus has again had to deploy refrigerator trucks to store corpses as emergency oxygen supplies were rushed in from outside and patients flown to hospitals in other states.
– Record burials –
According to official figures, Manaus last Wednesday saw a fourth straight day of record burials.
The state is also believed to be at the origin of a new virus variant recently detected in Japan, and which scientists warn is likely more contagious.It is not clear if this variant is the reason for the resurgence.
A ten-day curfew of 7:00 pm to 6:00 am entered into force in Amazonas last Friday in a bid to stop the rapid viral spread, and a court has compelled the state government to shut non-essential businesses for 15 days.Bolsonaro blames state governors and mayors for the health and economic crisis unleashed by the coronavirus, claiming the federal government has distributed all the resources needed to combat the epidemic.
His stance prompted protests in several cities last Friday. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Filipinos who are currently working in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) can avail themselves of free COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccination being offered by the host government to all local residents to stem the spread of the disease.Philippine Ambassador to the UAE Hjayceelyn Quintana said the Department of Health (DOH) – Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre are encouraging the public to get Sinopharm vaccine for free by booking an appointment with the Abu Dhabi Health Services (SEHA).Administered in two doses 21 days apart, the Sinopharm vaccine was earlier declared by the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) as 86 percent effective.Last month, Dubai also announced the rollout of the free Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine by the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) in addition to the free Sinopharm vaccine rollout UAE-wide.
Quintana called on the hundreds of Filipinos in the UAE to remain vigilant and diligent in taking COVID-19 precautions such as proper hand washing and social distancing and continue to support the measures and efforts of the host country in curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
On January 14, 2020, the Philippine government included travelers from the UAE and Hungary in the list of travelers from 30 other countries who are temporarily barred from entering the Philippines to prevent the spread of the more infectious COVID-19 variant.According to the travel restrictions issued by Malacanang, the imposition of a travel ban on the two countries will take effect starting 12:01 a.m. on January 17 until January 31.
The inclusion of the UAE in the list of restricted countries came shortly after a 27-year-old Filipino national who visited Dubai on December 27, 2020 has tested positive for the COVID variant upon his return in Manila on January 7, 2021. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The COVID-19 vaccine-related measures and the approval of more than 30 legislative priorities, including a bill seeking additional benefits for solo parents, are high on the agenda of the House of Representatives, asCongress buckles down to work on Monday.
The Lower Chamber is expected to expedite the passage of its 34 priority measures. These include House Bill Nos. 8316 and 8317, which seek to grant President Duterte the power to suspend the scheduled increases in the contribution rates of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) and the Social Security System (SSS) “in times of national emergencies.”

The twin measures were principally authored by Speaker Lord Allan Velasco.
House Bill No. 8097 or the Additional Benefits for Solo Parents is due to be approved on third and final reading by the chamber.The Houseidentified 47 legislative priorities, 13 of which were approvedon third and final reading.
These include the measures mentioned by President Duterte in his State of the Nation Address (SONA) last year.
These were the proposed Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer or FIST Act, Bureau of Fire Protection Modernization Act, Internet Transaction Act and Coconut Farmers and Industry Trust Fund Act.
Meanwhile, among the priority measures that are scheduled for committee deliberations and approval are the proposed Magna Carta of Barangays; National Housing Development Act; Department of Water Resources and Services; death penalty for plunder, heinous crimes related to drugs; rightsizing of the national government; and the Resolution of Both Houses No. 2, principally authored by Velasco, which seeks to amend the economicprovisions of the 1987 Constitution.
As directed by Velasco, the House Committee on Health, chaired byQuezon 4th District Rep. Angelina “Helen” Tan will look into the “government’s National COVID-19 Vaccine Roadmap and the efficacy of the life-saving shots to be administered in the country.”
“Our goal is to make sure that every Filipino will have access to safe and effective vaccine, which is currently the best way for us to beat the virus and move forward,” Velasco said in a statement.Under the 2021 General Appropriations Act signed by President Duterte last December 28, P72.5 billion was earmarked for the purchase, storage, transportation and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and another P2 billion was allocatedfor the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the country’s health workers.Tan said the hearing is aimed at ensuring that there will be“just, fair and equal” distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.
Expected to attend the hearing are Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and National Task Force Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.
Velasco assured the public that the leadership would continuously look after the safety of the chamber’s employees, saying that keeping the legislative mill grinding is “entirely dependent on the safety of our employees from the virus.”

Nograles made the statement as the government banks on vaccinating Filipinos to arrest the effects of the global health crisis.
In a TV interview, Nograles said the government will use standards adopted in other countries in vetting and examining all COVID-19 vaccines the country is set to procure.“Before any vaccine gets the approval of the [Food and Drug Administration], there is still a [Department of Science and Technology] Vaccine Expert Panel (DOST-VEP) that will study all of the data,” he said.
“[They] will pass through the VEP, then the FDA; and then the FDA will take a look at all these clinical studies, and all of the data possessed by the pharma companies,” he added.
Nograles, who heads the Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, said that on top of adopting the same standards with regard to the issuance of EUAs applied all around the world, the FDA has also required Sinovac and other pharmaceutical companies to submit Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) from other countries.
In the Philippines, EUAs have already been issued to Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Sinovac and Gamaleya are currently applying for EUAs.Nograles said that once vaccines are issued EUAs and distributed, they will be closely monitored by the government through its Adverse Effect Following Immunization Committee to make sure that they are safe and effective.
The Philippine government is targeting to vaccinate at least 50 million Filipinos against COVID-19 by the end of the year.
So far, the Philippines has procured 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac.The government also signed a tripartite agreement with British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for 17 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The latest solon to make such an appeal was San Jose Del Monte City Rep. Florida Robes, who noted Sunday, Jan. 17, that there is “too much information” on the vaccines, to the point that Filipinos are getting confused and anxious about it.
“The government, particularly the [Inter- Agency Task Force on the Management], should go on a massive information drive to give the real score on the vaccines and the vaccination program that soon will be rolled out when we have the vaccines,” she said.Robes, House Committee on People’s Participation chair, has been spearheading dialogues between international pharmaceutical companies and local health officials in order to facilitate the approval of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines.
She said that based on her numerous talks with her constituents, many have expressed their apprehension on receiving the anti-COVID jabs because of questions on safety and efficacy.
“Initially they wanted to get the vaccine but with the many information that they get from social media, [most of which] are not true, they are now having second thoughts. We should allay their fears through a massive information drive that will go all the way to the grassroots,” she said.
Robes expressed confidence that the Duterte administration will choose a vaccine that is proven safe and effective.“I know that they have the best interest of the Filipino people at heart. It’s just that there is just a lot of disinformation,” she said.
Deputy Speaker and Mandaluyong Rep. Neptali Gonzales II earlier asked the Department of Health (DoH) to seize the opportunity and launch a COVID vaccine educational campaign while the country waits for its supply of the antigen.
“All the billions of pesos appropriated by the government will simply go to waste if a substantial number of the people targeted by the vaccination program of the government will just refuse to be vaccinated, out of fear borne [from a] lack of information and understanding of the advantages of having it,” he said.Like Robes, Gonzales had also learned that a lot of his constituents were against having themselves vaccinated due to safety concerns and basic lack of knowledge.
“A massive information drive should really be fast-tracked on the ground level, so that the government’s national vaccination program will fully be successful,” he stressed. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said that COVID-19 vaccines are not yet guaranteed to be safe for children under 16 years old.
“So what we have now is a clearance for the use of vaccines in people above 16 years,” said Abeyasinghe.He said that vaccine developers did not prioritize kids on the clinical trials because of the “low risk of disease in children [and] also because of the critical imports of ensuring the vaccines are safe in the first place, among adults before they are tried on children.”
Abeyasinghe said that studies are now being conducted on the possible effects of COVID-19 vaccines to children.“We are closely working with the vaccine manufacturers, the academe and the research partners to better understand this. But the key issue is that, that is going to take time and maybe, in a few months, we will have better evidence to confidently say that these vaccines are safe and effective for children,”he said.“As time goes, as global experience increases, it will become clear whether these vaccines can be used for children and whether they are safe and effective. Once we have that evidence, we can consider the option for vaccinating children.”Meanwhile, the WHO official suggested conducting another survey on the willingness of Filipinos to get vaccinated against the viral disease.Abeyasinghe made the remark after he was asked on the recent survey results of Pulse Asia—- which reported that 47 percent of the 2,400 adult Filipinos who were surveyed said they do not want to get vaccinated against the viral disease due to safety concerns.“I like to draw attention to the fact that the Pulse Asia Survey was conducted at the end of November, before the second of December, and that was the time that we did not have emergency use authorization for any of the COVID vaccine,” he said.
“So that question was asked in a space where nobody knew about the possibility of COVID-19 vaccines becoming available so soon and about their safety and use in other countries. So we need to really ask this question again.”SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Duterte had said in August last year he was willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine first upon its arrival in the country.Robredo cited the mass vaccinations in Indonesia wherePresident Joko Widodo received his first dose of the China-made Sinovac vaccine in public.
“It seems there is no controversy about it. It could mean they have effective communications plan. Maybe they were able to explain to their people why it is their decision (of choosing Sinovac),” she said.In a survey, Filipinos indicated they are worried about the safety of the vaccine. On social media, memes about China-made products have also made rounds, further lowering the confidence about Sinovac.
Robredo attributed the controversy surrounding the choice of COVID-19 vaccine to the government’s failure to communicate properly to the public.“Some of our government officials are coming up with statements that do not help. There is controversy because, whether true or not, it seems that we’re taking the side of a particular vaccine (when) the people acknowledge that there is a better one,” she said.The opposition leaderdisputed the country’s vaccination program is just being politicized.“There are concerns that should be addressed. First is the low efficacy rate. Second is the reason why we are paying more for it compared to other countries. And third is why it (Sinovac) is being prioritized over others,” she said.

DAVAO CITY – Some businessmen have already approached the local government of Davao, expressing their intention to contribute to the purchase of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines, Mayor Sara Duterte said.
Duterte said, during her program over Davao City Disaster Radio (DCDR 87.5), that the private sector was willing to help the local government in its fight against COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the mayor did not reveal the identity of the businessmen and the amount that was pledged to the city.She said the city government could not yet accept their offer because of the limitations in the procurement process for the vaccines.
“The city government did not accept the money from the private sector because even us, in the local government, can’t directly go to the vaccine-maker and say we will buy vaccines,” she said.
Local government units may only procure COVID-19 vaccines by entering into a tripartite deal with the national government and vaccine-maker.
Last Thursday, a tripartite agreement among the national government, local government units, private sector, and vaccine manufacturer was signed to purchase additional 14.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.This will bring to 17 million the total vaccines to be procured under a tripartite scheme for the country, according to the National Task Force COVID-19.
AstraZeneca committed to deliver initial doses of AZD1222, the vaccine jointly developed by the British and with Oxford University, to Davao City by the third quarter of this year.
Duterte said the city’s supply of vaccines will augment the nationwide vaccination program, targeting individuals who are not in the priority list of the national government.The national government will give priority to frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens, remaining senior citizens, remaining indigent population, and uniformed personnel.
She said the local government did not set a ceiling on the budget for vaccines since it will also negotiate for more supply from other pharmaceutical firms.
Meanwhile, Duterte said the local government was not expecting the local economy to recover this year.
Citing the assessment of the tax and auditing service firm SGV, Duterte said the local economy may start picking up in 2022.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sen. Imelda “Imee” Marcos said the national task force against COVID-19 should ensure that the vaccines they will purchase are “halal” or permissible to millions of Muslim Filipinos so that more people can be vaccinated.

“Being mindful of religious and cultural beliefs will prevent losses in government spending and encourage vaccination,” Marcos said in a statement Sunday.
“Consult with halal-certifying bodies like the Islamic Da’wah Council of the Philippines, which comprises almost 100 Muslim organizations in the country, before finalizing the allocation of vaccines especially for BARMM (Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao),” the senator said.The lawmaker said the vaccines already granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, and Indonesia might also be better received by the country’s Muslim population.
Under Islamic law, Marcos pointed out that ingestion of pork and its derivatives is considered “haram” or forbidden, even the pork-extracted gelatin used to stabilize many vaccines during storage and transport.
She said the vaccine ingredient had led religious leaders in Indonesia in 2018 to declare the measles and rubella vaccines haram, resulting in fewer children being vaccinated and the country recording one of the highest infection rates in the world that year.
“The success of the government’s vaccination plan against COVID-19 will demand more sensitivity,” she said.“It’s not enough that vaccines be cheap and withstand the many stages of transport to distant island provinces like Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi,” she added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said Sunday he supports calls for another round of Senate inquiry on the rollout of the government’s COVID-19 vaccination program.
Drilon said the Senate Committee of the Whole should furnish only a preliminary – not final – report on the two hearings held on the government’s vaccination plan. The Senate minority leader pointed out the two-day inquiry left more questions than it answered.

“There are still a number of issues hanging. These too many unanswered questions raise grave concerns, for the survival of the country largely depends on our ability to implement a successful vaccination program against COVID-19 virus,” Drilon said in a statement.
“We did not get any definite answers to these serious questions. I believe another round of hearing is in order. I support the call of Sen. Panfilo Lacson for more hearings,” the senator said.
Drilon said the most urgent unanswered questions are issues about the pricing, the sourcing of the vaccines, the delivery schedules, and logistical support plan.“It was evident that preparations are not sufficient. We all want this vaccination plan to succeed. The Senate should continue to exercise its oversight power,” he said.
“The Senate has no agenda but to give the public access to information about the government’s vaccination plan,” he stressed.
Drilon lamented that the lack of access to information fuels doubts and confusion among the public.
A Senate hearing, he said, would be an opportunity for the public to be informed of the government’s vaccination plan and scrutinize the same.
“The success of the vaccination program – and the country’s economic recovery – depends on the ability to inoculate at least 60 percent of our population,” he said.
“How will the government convince people that the vaccines are safe? How can we strengthen our people’s confidence in the anti-coronavirus vaccine?” he added.
Sen. Panfilo “Ping” Lacson said last Saturday senators may manifest an intention to hold another hearing on the issues hounding the State’s inoculation plan when sessions resume Monday.Lacson said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. should answer senators’ questions about the government dealing with Sinovac president Helen Yang, who is based in Hong Kong.
Galvez, he said, kept changing his answers to the same questions posed by the senators. He also said there are too many “loose ends.”
Senate seeks further inquiry on COVID vaccine rolloutMalacañang said that the Chinese government will donate half-a-million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to the Philippines as the two countries reaffirmed their ties and cooperation against the pandemic.
The Office of the President (OP) revealed this after Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made a 40-minute courtesy call on President Duterte in Malacañang on Saturday.
In its statement, the OP said Wang assured President Duterte of China’s commitment to support the Philippines’ efforts to combat COVID-19, a disease that originated in the Asian giant.“He (Wang) announced that China will donate 500,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine to the Philippines. He likewise affirmed China’s resolve to do everything to ensure that vaccines become a global good,” Malacañang said.
Duterte lauded the continued high-level engagement between the Philippines and China even amid the pandemic and stressed the importance of both sides delivering on the promises of the Comprehensive Strategic Cooperation, Malacañang said.
President Duterte likewise stressed that cooperation on public health must be strengthened, particularly access to safe and effective vaccines, to safeguard the health of the people and to hasten the economic recovery of both nations and their neighboring countries.
“The recovery of nations… sits on the back of stronger economies, Duterte told Wang.
“China plays a very key role in reviving our region’s economy. Let us do all we can to revive economic activities between the Philippines and China,” he added.Malacañang said that President Duterte conveyed appreciation for China’s continuing support and cooperation in the country’s fight against COVID-19 in terms of medical equipment and supplies and sharing of experiences and expertise as well as in the repatriation of Filipino nationals.

Vice President Leni Robredo said on Sunday Filipinos can choose which brand of coronavirus vaccine they want to receive simply because they have the right to do so.

“Our health is our right. This is not a privilege that will only be accessible to a few. We have the right to demand (for information) that will affect our health,” Robredo said on her Sunday radio show.
The vice president urged the government to address concerns about the efficacy and the prices of the COVID-19 vaccine.Robredo said the people assigned to the procurement of the vaccines should disclose pertinent information that will instill confidence in the country’s vaccination program.
“The disclosure of the prices of the vaccine will help boost the people’s confidence in the program. This is not a take-it-or-leave-it deal. This is the way we can convince the people that inoculation of the vaccine is the way for us to go back to normal,” she said.
“If we are not going to exert any effort to tell the truth and address their concerns, this will not help in boosting their confidence,” Robredo explained.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. refused to reveal to senators the price by which the government is procuring the China-made Sinovac vaccines because of the non-disclosure agreement. He assured the chamber that Sinovac is cheaper than the ones offered by United States-produced vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna.But in reports, Sinovac is said to cost P3,629.50 for two doses against Pfizer’s P2,379, Moderna’s P3,904 to 4,504, and AstraZeneca’s P610. This is a far cry from the Rp200,000 (P700) per dose that Indonesia paid for Sinovac.
Robredo clarified that she isn’t discriminating against the vaccine’s manufacturer, but just wants assurance of its efficacy and cost.
She argued that the public has the right to question the cost of the vaccines because the government is using the taxpayers’ money for their procurement.It’s normal for the people to want to know about the vaccine’s efficacy rate since their health depends on it, Robredo said, adding that the government has an obligation to clarify these issues.
Pfizer has a reported 95% efficacy rate while Moderna has 94%. After two doses, AstraZeneca’s efficacy rate also jumps to 90%.
But what bothers a lot of Filipinos is the lower efficacy rate of Sinovac, the vaccine that’s scheduled to arrive in the Philippines next month. While some reports indicate the China-made vaccine also has an efficacy rate of 91%, others reported it could be only 78% or even around 50%. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
DILG Undersecretary for Barangay Affairs Martin Diño, in an interview over GMA News, said the barangays, specifically in Metro Manila, are ready with the list of the qualified recipients for the COVID-19 vaccine.
He noted that the local government units (LGUs) are only awaiting the order of the national government on the process of the vaccination.“Kami lang ang nakakaalam niyan. Barangay lang ang may listahan kung sino ang senior citizen, sino ang mga single parents, at of course, sino man ‘yung uunahin nating beneficiary (We are the ones who only know this (vaccine recipients). The barangays are the only ones that have the list of the senior citizens, single parents and of course those who should be prioritized),’’ Diño said.
Diño reiterated that the vaccination will prioritize frontliners and senior citizens based on the regulations of the national government.
“Sa barangay, uunahin natin, siyempre, magmula doon sa mga barangay tanod, barangay health worker, basta lahat ng nagtatrabaho dyan (At the barangay level, we will prioritize certainly from the barangay tanod, barangay health worker, all those working there),” he added.
After them, Diño noted the senior citizens will be next in line followed by those included in the directive of the city and national government.Diño added that the “barangay governments’’ are also preparing for the other logistics concerns of the vaccination events such as the facilities and equipment that will be used.
Similar to the disbursement of the Social Amelioration Program (SAP), Diño said the barangays are now preparing the areas where the vaccines will be first injected to the residents.
He noted that the DILG has also identified and prepared the areas like covered courts where the vaccination will be conducted.“Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams (BHERTs) can also help in the vaccination program,’’ Diño said.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. noted that the COVID-19 vaccination in the country may start by February with the first batch of vaccines expected to arrive during that month.He revealed that an estimated 25,000 personnel are undergoing training to administer COVID-19 vaccines to Filipinos.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement as the government faces accusations of favoring China’s Sinovac vaccine over what are supposed to be cheaper and more effective vaccine brands.
In his presser Thursday, Roque explained that his office will eventually discuss to the public the other COVID-19 vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Moderna, among others.“Well, in due course, ang plano namin dito sa press briefing (that is our plan for our press briefing), to build confidence,” he said.
“Lahat po iyang mga bakuna na iyan, as soon as they arrive, ay sasabihin po natin sa taumbayan kung anong datos. Kasama po iyan sa aming overall plan (All of those vaccines, as soon as they arrive, we will inform the public about them. That is part of our overall plan),” he added.
Armed with extensive research about the Chinese brand, Malacañang has been consistently telling the public about the developments of the Sinovac vaccine even though overseas tests show that other Western brands are cheaper and more effective than the Chinese brand.
In a radio interview last week, the public is free to wait for the vaccine of their choice but reminded them that a new and more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus has already entered the country.He said there is no reason for the public to doubt the Chinese vaccine since many items that people use every day are made in China.
Despite the public’s reservations about Sinovac, Malacañang is not concerned about the possibility of Filipinos opting out of the government’s vaccination program.
“Sa tingin ko po, itong ginagawa natin na pagpapaliwanag, bagama’t hinahaluan ng pulitika po ng mga kritiko ng administrasyon ay maiintindihan naman po ng taumbayan kung ano ang ginagawa ng gobyerno (I think that through this information campaign that we are doing, even though critics of the administration are politicizing it, people understand what the government is doing),” Roque said.
In his public address last week, President Duterte defended his preference for the Chinese vaccine but said the government will not force the public if they do not want it.
Duterte will be among the last people to be inoculated. On the other hand, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan have both received their first dose of Sinovac as they roll out their vaccination program. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Gordon said Saturday that implementing the Universal Health Care (UHC) law would ensure the speedy and organized rollout of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination program.
Senator Richard Gordon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)Gordon said that the UHC mandates that every Filipino should register with a public or private primary care provider of choice, adding that it would be easier to distribute the vaccine if they are registered with their primary care providers.
He stressed that implementation of the UHC law would facilitate COVID-19 vaccination roll out.“Nakalagay diyan (The UHC law states that) every Filipino shall register with public or private primary care provider of choice. May duty ang bawat Pilipino na magregister siya (All Filipinos have the duty to register). We must implement it because that is what the law provides and if we do it hindi tayo mahihirapan (we will not face difficulties),” he said.

“Kung may primary health care provider magawa ‘yan. Madali nating malalaman kung sinong may sakit sa primary health care provider na ‘yan, tama po ba yan?

The Senate Committee of the Whole (COW) may call for a third public hearing on the planned roll out of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines by the Duterte administration to inoculate tens of millions of Filipinos as answers of key government officials to questions showed inconsistencies.
This planned call might be discussed by senators when they review next week the transcripts of the two-day in-person and virtual public hearings because only 50 percent of the questions fielded by senators were clearly explained, Sen. Panfilo M. Lacson said today during a DWIZ radio interview.
‘’There were many loose ends…hanging questions,’’ Lacson said.
He cited a government statement that there could be a discount for the shipment of 44 million doses of vaccines to the Philippines through the COVAX program by European countries and the World Health Organization (WHO).
It turned out that the vaccine shipment by COVAX is free, he said.
Lacson cited a query by Senate President Vicente C. Sotto III, COW chairman, on the price per dose of AstraZeneca vaccine and the answer of businessman Joey Concepcion, Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion, is $5.
When Sotto asked vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. on the price of a Sinovac vaccine, Galvez’s answer is ‘’we are bound by Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement (CDA).’’
Despite a ‘’government to government’’ (G to G) policy in negotiating for the supply of vaccines, the national government is dealing with a ‘’Helen Yang’’ based in Hong Kong representing Sinovac, a privateChinese pharmaceutical firm, and not with the Chinese government, Lacson pointed out.
Lacson also questioned the track record of Sinovac whose president allegedly bribed Chinese officials to get a certification for its vaccine product.
When asked by Sen.Nancy Binay whether the National Task Force could still back out of its commitment with Sinovac, Galvez replied in the affirmative.
From a plate of seven foreign-made vaccines, senators were not comfortable with Sinovac because of its low efficacy rate and it is relatively expensive.
They fielded questions scrutinizing the ‘’seeming’’ preference of task force officials for Sinovac vaccines.
They also asked Galvez to explain why the government signed an agreement to secure 25 million doses of Sinovac’s vaccine, considering that its Phase 3 trials are still being consolidated and the company had yet to secure emergency use approval (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration.

It is important that the recipient should have a health body before getting vaccinated, said Vergeire.
So far, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the use of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines after it recently granted the American drug-maker an emergency use authorization.Vergeire said that individuals with pre-existing conditions, as well as pregnant women, may receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, provided that they will be assessed first by their doctors.The Health official also said that the Pfizer vaccines are not recommended for 16-years-old and below.“Hindi pa nasusubukan itong bakuna na ito sa mga bata…Hindi po munang puwedeng ibigay sa mga bata (This vaccine has not been tested on children…Currently, it cannot be given to children),” said Vergeire.Vergeire also advised that individuals who contracted COVID-19 before should be vaccinated to avoid reinfection.Meanwhile, the DoH reported 2,058 new cases of COVID-19 in the country Saturday, bringing the country’s total tally to 498,691.The DoH said that 406 more patients recovered, raising the total number of those who have beaten the disease to 460,133.

“Having a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine ready for deployment to the Filipino people at a time where no available treatment has yet been developed provides us a long-term solution and a higher chance of successfully defeating the virus,” she said.
“This milestone is another proof that science, despite the challenge of compressing to compress into months a process that usually takes a decade or more to complete, is pivotal in the fight against an unprecedented public health emergency which has already claimed millions of lives globally, and is still affecting millions more in so many aspects worldwide, including the Philippines,” she added.
Under the EUA, the FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products in an emergency situation to treat or prevent life-threatening diseases when certain statutory criteria have been met.
Guevera mentionedthat “While this is not yet a Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) or a marketing authorization, we are confident that the principles of science and regulatory reliance were adopted by our Filipino scientific experts in the process of evaluating the available safety and effectiveness data of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine.”
“This significant step strengthens the commitment of the Department of Science and Technology’s (DoST) commitment, as part of the NTF COVID-19 Task Group on Vaccine Evaluation and Selection (VES), to provide Filipinos the best scientific and innovative solutions to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic,” she added.

Deputy Speaker Buhay party-list Rep. Lito Atienza blamed the previous Cayetano Speakership for the measly initial appropriation for COVID-19 vaccine procurement under the 2021 national budget.
Atienza touched on this matter in a statement Friday in response to a criticism from Taguig-Pateros Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano against current Speaker Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco.
Cayetano and his allies have earlier faulted the Velasco leadership for not actively holding public hearing or investivations on topics of public interest, such as the vaccination and PhilHealth issues.“There were no investigations yet because we prioritized cleaning up the mess that was left in the GAB (General Appropriations Bill) and reopened the budget hearings that Cayetano and his allies unceremoniously closed, which was why we uncovered the weakest link of the GAB – the pathetic P2.5-billion budget for COVID vaccines,” Atienza said.
The GAB represents the initial filing of the proposed national budget in Congress, specifically in the 300-member House of Representatives.
Atienza in the statement recalled that last Oct. 6, then-Speaker Cayetano moved to terminate plenary deliberations on the P4.5-trillion GAB before approving the measure on second reading and suspending sessions until Nov. 16, 2020.
But last Oct. 12, an overwhelming majority of House lawmakers ousted Cayetano and elected Velasco as Speaker. This took place a day before the start of the four-day special session called by President Duterte for Congress to pass the GAB. The House approved the budget bill on third and final reading on Oct. 16.
Atienza said that after discovering the rather low amount of P2.5 billion that the Cayetano leadership had allocated for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, the Velasco-led House increased the vaccine budget to P8 billion, and later to P72.5 billion, under the budget bill.
The Chief Executive signed the 2021 GAB into law last Dec. 28. The first to be crafted in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s national budget is seen as crucial in government’s delivery of both health and economic response.

The Department of Finance (DOF) is working on fresh loans from multilateral financial institutions, bilateral partners and domestic creditors to fund the government’s coronavirus response programs.Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said they are now working to borrow $1.46 billion, or roughly P70 billion, from foreign or local sources to fund the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines that can inoculate at least 50 million Filipinos.

The P70 billion forms part of the P82.5 billion budget required by the government to provide COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate adult Filipinos.
To date, the government already identified P12.5 billion, of which, P10 billion will come from the funds allocated for the COVID-19 vaccination program under the Bayanihan To Recover As One Act and P2.5 billion from the Department of Health 2021 budget.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank(AIIB) are among the sources of funding for the vaccine fund, Dominguez said.“We will fully recover from this crisis once a safe and effective vaccine becomes available to us, on the strength of our enduring macroeconomic fundamentals,” Dominguez said in a statement.The ADB has so far been the biggest loan provider to help financethe Philippines’ COVID-19 response programs.
As of December 15, ADB has approved and signed with the DOF a total of $3.93 billion in loans and another $8 million in grants related to the government’s pandemic response measures.
A total of $2.27 billion in loanshas been secured by the DOF from the World Bank, while another $750 million will be provided by the Beijing-led AIIB.The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has also signed a $458.95-million loan with the DOF for the second phase of its Post-Disaster Standby Loan and another $458.95 million loan for the government’s COVID-19 Crisis Response Emergency Support program.Japan has also extended a US$18.36-million non-project grant aid for the provision of medical equipment to the DOH. France’s L’Agence Française de Développement has provided $276.2 million, while Korea, through its Korean Export-Import Bank–Economic Development Cooperation Fund, has pledged $100 million.A total of $5.1 billion was raised through the issuance of US-dollar denominated global bonds in April and December.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“Indi ako magpa vaccinate sa probinsya kung indi mismo matuslok sa lawas ko (I will not be pushing for the vaccination program in the province if I don’t get vaccinated),” Defensor said in his weekly press conference.
This was after the Iloilo provincial government signed a multilateral agreement with British pharmaceutical firm AztraZeneca and the national government to procure the COVID-19 vaccine.The governor emphasized it was important for residents of the 42 towns and component city of Passi to know that the vaccine was safe, and getting himself innoculated may convince others to do the same.
Defensor cited a survey that there is a large percentage of Filipinos who do not want to get the COVID-19 vaccine.The Department of Health (DOH) has previously allayed fears after the controversy surrounding Dengvaxia, the vaccine against dengue.
Along with DOH’s Western Visayas regional office, Defensor presided over a meeting with mayors of the 42 towns and Passi City to lay down how the plan on how the vaccination program in the province will be rolled out. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Health practitioners are advising against the use of different brands of COVID-19 vaccines.
During the continuation of the Senate Committee of the Whole’s inquiry on the government’s immunization program Friday, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the protocol was to give individuals two doses of the coronavirus vaccines of the same brand.

“You wouldn’t want to toy with the idea of giving different vaccines for the simple reason that if an adverse event following immunization does happen, or (if there is) an adverse event of special interest, we are going to struggle which of these two different vaccines must have caused it,” Duque said after Senate President Vicente Sotto III raised questions from the public on the possibility of using different brands of vaccines, and whether or not they can get doses of vaccine from another brand after they are inoculated.Dr. Lulu Bravo of the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) said using different brands of coronavirus vaccines is not recommended due to the lack of studies on its results.
“This is not recommended, your honor. Interchangeability — that is what we call it — is actually a no-no, because no company will be willing to do a study on that kind of a process,” she said.
“Most of the results that we will get, if these were done, will not really be based on standard procedures. This is not a recommended procedure that you will interchange or use another vaccine after you have used another one before,” she stressed.
Duque last January 11 said that brands of COVID-19 vaccines have various specifications which will be considered before they are administered to the beneficiaries of the government’s inoculation program.The vaccines will be used depending on the characteristics of the recipients, he said.

“Pfizer is very keen to partner with the Philippines and ensure that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is available for use in the country,” Pfizer Philippines country manager Andreas Riedel said at the resumption of the Senate Committee of the Whole’s inquiry on the government’s nationwide immunization program.
“We plan to make vaccine doses available in the Philippines as quickly as possible based on the terms of a fully-executed supply agreement and we are working closely with the national government to potentially close the supply agreement soon,” he said.Riedel said the pharmaceutical company is already in “advanced discussions” with authorities about the COVID-19 vaccine supply agreement.
The vaccine supply will be offered to the low-income countries like the Philippines “at a not-for-profit price,” he added.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has just granted Pfizer-BioNtech’s application for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the vaccines it developed.
During the Senate’s Jan. 11 hearing, National Task Force Against COVID-19 chief and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said they are eyeing to secure about 40 million doses of vaccines from Pfizer.FDA Director-General Eric Domingo said Pfizer’s vaccine is already being used by over five million people worldwide.

Sen. Imee R. Marcos urged the government Friday to give weight to COVID-19 vaccines that included more Asian participants in their efficacy trials.
Senator Imee R. Marcos (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
“Besides cost, cold storage requirements, ease of use, and the media hype, we must not overlook the Asian factor in choosing the safest vaccines for Filipinos,” she said.
Marcos, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Economic Affairs, pointed out that three leading vaccine candidates that received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in Western countries had conducted trials in which less than five percent of participants were Asian.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reported that only 4.7 percent of participants in Moderna’s vaccine trials were Asian while the medical journal The Lancet showed that Asians averaged only 4.4 percent in UK and Brazil trials for the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Although Pfizer placed the overall efficacy of its vaccine at 95 percent, only 4.3 percent of trial participants were Asian and efficacy particularly among non-whites was lower at 74.4 percent.
The lack of a clearer breakdown of various Asian ethnicities in vaccine trials has also led health experts in India to call for greater participation of its ethnically diverse groups before granting an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Western-made vaccines, Marcos said.
“Vaccines may actually be customized in the future,” Marcos added, citing a study published in December by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Using artificial intelligence and a vaccine similar to that of Pfizer and Moderna, MIT researchers found that Asians were less likely to respond to the experimental vaccine than Caucasians.

Sen. Panfilo Lacson (Joseph Vidal/Senate PRIB)
“During last night’s Zoom meeting to discuss vaccine updates on ‘Test, Trace, Treat’ (T3), the country’s vaccine czar, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. virtually accused the Senate or at least some senators who asked questions during last Monday’s hearing, of, quoting his own words, ‘demonizing’ vaccine developers or ‘hurting’ the ongoing negotiations of our government with vaccine manufacturers and suppliers, apparently referring to Sinovac,’’ he said.
‘’He (Galvez) specifically mentioned my name as allegedly politicizing the issue at hand mainly because of Secretary (Francisco) Duque, which I deny of course; as well as the names of Senators (Juan Miguel) ‘’Migz’’ Zubiri and (opposition Sen. Francis) ‘’Kiko’’ Pangilinan, in relation to the Sinovac vaccine, as if blaming the Senate for the brewing vaccine procurement controversies,’’ he added.
In today’s second COW public hearing, Pangilinan immediately butted in and informed Senate President Vicente Sotto III that he was associating himself with Lacson’s manifestation.Lacson explained that ‘’we senators do not spend long hours seeking clarification from our resource persons like Secretary Galvez because it is incumbent upon us to exercise our mandate to demand transparency and accountability from our chief implementers on how they plan to use public funds.’’
‘’In this case, to recover from a health crisis that continues to threaten every aspect of human life. After all, I am certain that everyone in this hall and those attending online will agree that our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is not a single man’s business,’’ he said.
‘’It is a matter of record that Congress wasted no time in passing legislative measures and appropriations to quickly respond and address the current health crisis. In fact, Mr. President, for the national government’s vaccination program alone, which currently stands at P87.5 billion speaks volumes of the legislature’s resolve and commitment to our nation’s common cause,’’ he stressed.
“Let me assure Secretary Galvez: Walang pulitika sa pagdinig na ito. Katulad din ng sinagawa nating pagdinig kamakailan lamang sa pang-abusong ginawa sa pondo ng PhilHealth na sa kasalukuyan as we speak, ay may mga kasong criminal na hinaharap ang ilang indibidwal. We call it oversight, or check-and-balance, if you will, being exercised by a coequal branch of government,’’ he added.(There is no politicking here. Because of what we did in the hearing on alleged abuses of public funds by Philippine Health Insurance Corp., there are now criminal charges slapped against certain individuals)
‘’It is indeed unfortunate that the Senate is being dragged as scapegoat by projecting the narrative that this inquiry is being used as an avenue for political agenda,’’ he explained. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“Vaccine manufacturers, governments, hospitals, and local communities are facing significant challenges in transporting, storing, and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine options due to the requirement of maintaining a constant temperature from -20℃ down to -80℃ in order to retain their effectiveness. Currently, very few options are available to handle the distribution requirements of these vaccines,” said Enrico Klauer CEO of MECOTEC.“Through our partnership with DMI, we aim to help equip the Philippines with an effective solution that addresses these concerns as the local distribution of COVID-19 vaccines are on the horizon,” he adds.
“The local distribution of these vaccines require a thorough understanding of our geographical complexities. To address the lengthy logistical lead time often associated with transporting goods within our borders, we need a solution that would allow these vaccines to be stored and transported at the required temperature for a longer period of time.” shares Jess Co President of DMI.
“With MECOTEC’s technology, we can efficiently address these concerns, and even reach smaller and more remote communities,” he adds.Designed to address these challenges, the MCF8 is equipped with the following beneficial features:Active deep cooling technology to freeze contents from a low of -20℃ down to an ultra low -80℃ to meet the handling requirements of the various vaccine options

The Philippine government is yet to formally tap the country’s cold chain industry for the handling and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
Anthony Dizon, president of the Cold Chain Association of the Philippines (CCAP), said in a phone interview that the industry is still waiting for the government to accept the industry’s offer to play a role in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine.

CCAP is a multi-sectoral group of companies involved in the handling, storage, and distribution of chilled and frozen food, among other products.
According to Dizon, the industry, “individually and collectively”, has more than enough capacity to participate in the country’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution program.
Right now, he said the cold chain industry’s total cumulative capacity stood at 500,000 pallet containers, while the initial 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine will consume only less than 200 pallets.
“Our initial estimate is that even if we are called upon to play a role in the storage of the vaccine, it will constitute a small portion of our capacity,” Dizon said.
“The industry is just waiting for the government to approach us,” he added. 
In a previous report, National Task Force Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer and Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government is now in discussion with the private sector regarding the state-led distribution of COVID-19 vaccine.
“I’m thankful to the private sector for throwing their support to us, like what they did when we ramped up our testing capacity,” said Galvez.
On the part of CCAP, however, Dizon said that no official dialogue has so far taken place between the organization and the government regarding this matter. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“So iyong 50,000, iyan po siguradong papasok ng Pebrero pero mas malaki pa po posible ang numero (So the 50,000 will certainly arrive in February but it is possible the number will be bigger),” he added.
Roque earlier claimed that the Chinese-developed vaccines could be the only preventive drug available in the country from February to June since other vaccines are expected to be delivered by July.
Despite concerns raised by some groups about its low efficacy rate, the government pushed through with a supply deal for 25 million doses of Sinovac vaccines, with the first 50,000 doses expected to arrive next month. The rest of the vaccines will be delivered until December 2021.Apart from Sinovac vaccines, the country has secured additional supplies from Serum Institute of India and AstraZeneca to help protect Filipinos from the coronavirus. The government aims to secure 148 million doses of vaccines to benefit 70 million Filipinos to achieve herd immunity. Frontline health workers, poor and vulnerable sector, essential workers are among the priority beneficiaries of the free vaccines.

The Department of Finance (DOF) assured that the government has sufficiently funds to procure enough doses of COVID-19 vaccines from various sources in line with its target to inoculate around half of the population.
In a statement, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said yesterday that the DOF has “in place” P75 billion of the P82.5 billion budget required to provide vaccines to at least 50 million Filipinos.Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III
Of the P82.5 billion, P2.5 billion is already under the 2021 budget of the Department of Health (DOH), while P10 billion will come from the funds allocated for the COVID-19 vaccination program under the Bayanihan To Recover As One Act.Dominguez said the remaining P70 billion will be sourced fromloans provided by multilateral lenders,the Philippines’ bilateral partnersand/or the domestic market.
The DOF currently is processing around P62.5 billion, or roughly $1.3 billion, through loans with multilateral banks to procure COVID-19 vaccines for adult Filipinos.
These multilateral institutions include the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank (WB) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
According to Dominguez, the government is targeting to inoculate about 50 million to 70 million adult Filipinos aged 18 years old and above.
“We have 110 million Filipinos. Of the 110 million, around 40 million are below the ages of 18 and it is not recommended that teenagers and below get the vaccine. So, you knock off 40 million out of 110 million. That leaves you 70 million Filipinos potentially to vaccinate,” he said.
The COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use so far are only allowed for adults aged 18 years old and above, as there are no clinical trials yet involving children.
Dominguez said initial computations place the conservative cost per person to be vaccinated at P1,300, which already includes the required doses, syringe, storage, equipment, information campaign, monitoringand other support services.
At P1,300 per person, the government would be able to inoculate roughly 57 million to 60 million Filipinos out of the 70 million that need to be vaccinated, Dominguez said.“Now, that leaves you 13 million people. We expect the 13 million to be covered by the LGUs (local government units), the private sector, and of course,there are the recusants—the guys who don’t believe in vaccination,” Dominguez said.
“So, basically, we are going to be covered and I think we will be able easily now,with the resources that we have raised,to vaccinate 60 million Filipinos,” he added.Earlier, Finance Undersecretary Mark Dennis Joven said the DOF has begun the process of negotiating with the WB and ADB at least $800 million in funds for the COVID-19 vaccination program through a project loan, with the DOH as implementing agency.
The financing support from the ADB and the WB carries low interest rates, with an average maturity period of at least 1o years, Joven said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A total of 17 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from private sector are expected to be made available in the second semester to inoculate 8 million Filipinos from 39 local government units (LGUs).
These 39 LGUs, together with 300 donor companies and vaccine supplier AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines, Inc., participated in the “A Dose of Hope” ceremonial Signing Wave 2.
(Go Negosyo / MANILA BULLETIN)
Those who signed Wave 2 of “A dose of Hope” were Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines Inc. country president Lotis Ramin, Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, and Ambassador Daniel Pruce of the British Embassy.Concepcion said the 17 million doses summed up the private sector donations from Wave 1 with 35 companies, and 300 donor firms for Wave 2.
Based on the agreement, 50 percent of the donated vaccines will be given to the donors for their own employees and 50 percent will go to the government through the Department of Health, which will allocate these vaccines to identified sectors.
For the second wave of the “A Dose of Hope” project, the same tripartite model was adopted as vaccine procurement is still under Emergency Use Authorization – an authorization issued for unregistered drugs and vaccines in a public health emergency.
Under this situation, only the government is allowed to deal and procure vaccines from various vaccine makers.“I like to thank first Secretary Charlie Galvez. Without your support, this tripartite agreement would have not been possible. Also, I like to thank the CEO of AstraZeneca, Lotis Ramin. Without your doses, we will not be here today to sign the agreement. We admire your company and your patriotism. These vaccines are really the way forward in helping our Filipino save lives and livelihood. Ambassador Pruce for all your efforts in forging this partnership and helping the negotiations move forward. And the private sector, our donors. The first batch was about 35 of the conglomerates who supported the program, and in the second batch, around 300 companies supported the program. And of course, our LGUs, who are now part of the Dose of Hope, 39 of them,” Concepcion said.
Concepcion also hinted of a Wave 3 of the “A Dose of Hope” donation drive, stating they are talking with another provider although he did not discount another collaboration with AstraZeneca, citing the patriotism of its country head Lotis Ramin.
“There is still a long list of private sector wanting to purchase vaccines,” he said.Galvez explained that the government cannot delegate the responsibility of importing the vaccines to anybody else because there are still ongoing trials.
“All emergency use should be controlled by the government,” he stressed.
“We cannot commercialize the procurement of vaccines,” he said adding that no vaccine company will sell to different companies but to the national governments only.
Concepcion also supported Galvez, saying the private sector will abide with its agreement with the government for their respective roles.
Galvez said that the government is targeting between 50 to 70 million people to be inoculated this year and another wave next year.Local chief executives from participating LGUs that procured vaccines from AstraZeneca also graced the the Wave 2 signing program.
They include Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, Pasay City Mayor Imelda Calixto-Rubiano, Valenzuela City Mayor Rex Gatchalian, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte, San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora, Navotas City Mayor Toby Tiangco, Las Piñas City Vice Mayor April AguilarNery, Makati City Mayor Abby Binay, Mandaluyong City Mayor Carmelita Abalos, Parañaque City Mayor Edwin Olivarez, Muntinlupa City Mayor Jaime Fresnedi, Caloocan City Mayor Oscar Malapitan, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto, and Tracing Czar Baguio City Mayor Benjie Magalong, among others.
The government is targeting to secure 148 million doses.
To date, Galvez said, the tally has reached 137 million doses once all purchase contracts are signed this month.
Concepcion said that the Philippines cannot be left behind in the COVID-19 vaccination. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The country could endure a spike in the daily average cases of coronavirus following the detection of the first case of the more infectious strain, a Palace official warned Thursday.

(OPS / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque bared the information given by epidemiologist Dr. John Wong that the new coronavirus variant could be “56 percent more infectious” than the original strain.
The latest warning was issued as the Palace official moved to justify the country’s need for COVID-19 vaccine supply as early as next month to curb the spread of the illness.
“Bakit ba ho importanteng dumating ang bakuna sa Pebrero at hindi sa Hulyo kung saan una nating inaasahan ang delivery ng mga western vaccines? Eh ito na nga po ang katotohanan: Nakapasok na sa Pilipinas ang new variant ng COVID-19 (Why is it important for the vaccines to arrive in February, not June, when we expect the delivery of western vaccines? This is the truth: the new COVID-19 variant has entered the Philippines),” Roque said during a televised press briefing.“Sabi po ng dalubhasang Dr. Wong – ang prediksyon niya – itong bagong variant ay 56% more infectious than the ordinary COVID-19 strain. So kung ngayon po ay mayroon tayong 2,600 average na kaso ng COVID-19, ang 50% po, ibig sabihin niyan, kalahati ay madadagdag sa figure na iyan…Aabot po iyan ng mga 4,000 daily cases(According to Dr. Wong, his predictions is the new variant is 56 percent more infectious than the ordinary COVID-19 strain. If we now have 2,600 in average COVID-19 cases, it means it could reach 4,000 daily cases),” he said.
“Eh kung imu-multiply din po iyan sa isang buwan, napakalaking numero po iyan (If we multiply that number in a month, that is a huge number),” he said.
After enforcing travel restrictions on several countries affected by the dreaded illness, the Philippines recently reported its first case of the new coronavirus strain that emerged in the United Kingdom. A passenger who arrived from the United Arab Emirates tested positive for the new COVID variant and is now under quarantine.So far, Roque said the health department has not reported any local transmission of the new COVID variant the country.President Duterte earlier raised concern about the arrival of the new COVID strain in the country, describing it as the “new monster.” Duterte said he was praying that the new variant would not be more dangerous and toxic than its predecessor.
Faced with the new coronavirus threat, Roque has defended the government’s purchase of 25 million coronavirus vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac BioTech, insisting its safety and efficacy.He said the initial shipment of the 50,000 vaccines, which he claimed government bought at a cost befitting a close friend of China, will arrive next month. The rest of the vaccines will be delivered in the succeeding months until December 2021.“Bakit tayo tatanggi sa limang milyon na Sinovac na mga bakuna na pupuwedeng labanan pati po itong mas nakakahawa na bagong virus strain ng COVID-19 (So why would we reject 5 million Sinovac vaccines that can fight this more infectious new virus strain of COVID-19?),” he asked.
The country has logged nearly half a million cases of coronavirus since it was first detected early this year. More than 9,000 people died due to the illness in the country.
To help fight the pandemic, the government has scaled up the acquisition of vaccines from manufacturers abroad. Among the initial supplies would come from Serum Institute of India, Sinovac, and AstraZeneca. More supply deals with other vaccine makers are being finalized by the government.

China’s pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech has applied for an emergency use authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said.
(NOEL CELIS / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)
“Yesterday afternoon, Sinovac from China submitted an application. They are undergoing pre-assessment now,” said FDA Director General Rolando Enrique Domingo.
Domingo said that the Chinese company still needs to submit more data about their vaccine. He said that Sinovac has so far submitted the results of their Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.“We will have to ask for their Clinical Trial Phase 3 report, which I believe they are collating and consolidating. Until we see them, we cannot assess it fully as the EUA is anchored on the Phase 3 results,” said Domingo.
“We will have to wait for the Phase 3 clinical trial results because that would be the main part that we will be evaluating before actual evaluation starts,” he added.
Sinovac Biotech is the fourth vaccine developer that submitted an application for an EUA in the Philippines for COVID-19 vaccines.
Domingo said it is unsure if Sinovac can secure an approval by February as projected by vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez. “It really depends on how quickly they submit the data that we want, and how convincing the data is,” Domingo said.Meanwhile, Domingo said that they are still evaluating the applications of United Kingdom-based firm AstraZeneca and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute.
So far, American drug-maker Pfizer was the first to secure an EUA approval from the FDA.
“We have pending applications. AstraZeneca is in the middle of evaluation and the experts are waiting for some clarifications and we hope to finish that evaluation and make a decision within the 21 days (of processing) that was set,” he said.“The early evaluation has started for Gamaleya, for the Sputnik V vaccine…There are still some pending documents and some requirements (needed),” he added.

Senators will call for an executive session to ask authorities about the cost of the COVID-19 vaccines that the Philippines will purchase from pharmaceutical companies, Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri said.
(Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
In an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel, he maintained their appeal for transparency in the government’s negotiations for the acquisition of coronavirus vaccines.The chamber’s Committee of the Whole is set to continue Fridayits inquiry on the government’s inoculation program.“We’re going to…an executive session so that they don’t of course violate their non-disclosure agreement. We will ask them to disclose the prices of their purchase of the vaccines, ‘yung amounts na babayaran (the amounts to be paid), for transparency,” Zubiri said.The Senate leader said the Executive department cannot always invoke its non-disclosure deals with the vaccine manufacturers especially it concerns the use of public funds.
“To us, ‘yung (the) non-disclosure agreements cannot be used for government funds because we have to properly account it. Importante po ito (This is important). That is the key to transparency,” he said.“Hindi naman puwede nating sabihin na: ‘Ah, huwag kayong mag-aalala, kami na ang bahala dito, kami ang may alam ng presyo, pero huwag kayong magalala, hindi tayo dehado.’ Hindi po puwede ang ganon sa gobyerno, dahil may CoA po tayo,” he added.(We cannot just say: ‘Don’t worry, we will handle this, we know the prices, but don’t worry, we will not be on the losing end.’ We can’t allow that in government, because we have a Commission on Audit)The government has already bought some 25 million COVID vaccines from Sinovac, with an initial 50,000 doses to arrive in the country next month.
Zubiri said he finds the deal “worrisome” as he echoed concerns on the “low” efficacy of the Chinese drugmaker’s product.International reports said Sinovac’s vaccine was only about 50.4 percent effective in preventing coronavirus infection in a late-stage clinical trial in Brazil.Still, officials in the Eexecutive department defended it, insisting that the Chinese government has even offered the Philippines the “best price” for its purchase.“It’s also a matter of trust. Kailangan maipakita po natin sa ating mga kababayan na ito’y ligtas na mga bakuna (We have to show our countrymen that these vaccines are safe), because we had this issue on the Dengvaxia. We want to make sure that people will satisfied and will be given at least a measure of trust that these vaccines are effective,” he said.“But in (all) fairness, I trust Sec. (Carlito) Galvez, he’s a good man. I’m glad he’s on top of the vaccine situation. Ang request lang namin (Our only request) is let’s be transparent about it,” he appealed. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Pateros Mayor Miguel Ponce III warned that they cannot force the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine on people due to safety and efficacy concerns. Pateros Mayor Miguel Ponce III (IsangPateros)
Ponce made the comment in a speech at the inaugural session of the 11th Sangguniang Bayan of Pateros where he said the municipal government will purchase P20 million worth of COVID-19 vaccine for Pateros residents.“Majority of the local governments in the National Capital Region have placed their orders and we, too, in the Municipality of Pateros have earmarked the amount of P20 million for the purchase of this vaccine but we would like to proceed with caution for several reasons,” he said.“First, we cannot force this vaccine on our people. We therefore need to know the percentage of our population that needs to be inoculated so as not to waste any vaccine purchase from our own funds,” Ponce said
Ponce added, “Our national government and local governments, particularly in the National Capital Region, have their eyes set on the vaccine that seems to be the only hope to get out of this chain of the pandemic that continuously enslaves us.”
The national government, he said, should be part of the education campaign to raise awareness on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.“I also believe that most people would wait that this vaccine (be) started administering in other people in other parts of this country and see that they are effective and safe before they give their ‘yes’ to this vaccine,” the mayor said.
The Pateros municipal government has started registering people who want to be vaccinated through three methods: submitting online form, QR code, and getting forms from health centers.He later told Teleradyo radio program that the P20 million budget will target to vaccinate 50,000 out of 80,000 residents.

BACOLOD CITY – Mayor Evelio Leonardia announced on Wednesday that the City of Bacolod is getting 650,000 AstraZeneca doses to start off the city’s vaccination program against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
This development came after Leonardia signed a deal with the Oxford-British firm last week, allocating P300 million for the procurement of COVID vaccines.
“This is a giant leap towards realizing our vaccination goals,” the mayor said.Leonardia said that this means that a very substantial number of the population can be vaccinated as soon as the product becomes available in the country.
He admitted that he was excited to make the announcement after getting AstraZeneca’s consent due to the confidentiality clause in the agreement.
The city government of Bacolod signed a multilateral agreement with AstraZeneca and national government agencies, and a confidentiality agreement with AstraZeneca here on January 7.
“This is definitely a very good start,” he said as he thanked the City Council for its support and cooperation.The city has already identified the 22 sites to be used as vaccination centers.
1% COVID positivity rate
The city continues to record a decreasing trend in the number of COVID-19 positive cases based on the data of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC)- Task Force.
The latest data released on January 10 showed that only 0.52 percent, or less than one percent turnout, was recorded which was derived from 191 specimens sent to the Department of Health (DOH)-accredited molecular laboratories.As of January 11, Bacolod has already tested a total of 49,920 individuals in the six operational molecular laboratories in the city.
“We have consistently maintained our fresh cases to a single digit and we have also maintained our testing average of 160 to 200, and sometimes 200 to 300 per day when there are no holidays,” said EOC deputy for medical and data assessment Dr. Chris Sorongon.This is to dispel rumors that our COVID-19 cases dropped because we did not perform testing, he added.
Sorongon reminded the public to always observe minimum health protocols, such as the wearing of face masks and face shields, frequent washing of hands, and observance of physical distancing.“Let’s not be complacent and let’s always be responsible,” he said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The President said he would let the frontline workers, the poor, and the uniformed personnel get the priority in getting inoculated against the coronavirus illness once the vaccines become available.
“Kasama kayo mga sundalo natin, kasama sa priority. Mauna talaga ‘yung pobre, yung wala talaga. Tapos kayo. halos. Kung milyon ‘yan, magsabay-sabay na kayo at saka huli na kami (The soldiers will be among the priority. The poor, those with nothing, will be the first, followed by you. If the vaccines are millions, you can simultaneously get it. We’ll be the last),” he said during a televised address Wednesday night.“Kung may maiwan para sa amin kay (Senator) Bong (Go), kay (Defense Secretary Delfin) Lorenzana, kung may maiwan eh di para sa atin (If there will be vaccines left for us, Senator Bong, Lorenzana, if there is something left, that will be for us),” he added.
As the government steps up the acquisition of vaccines, the President has pledged that all Filipinos would be vaccinated but the government will employ certain geographical and sectoral strategy in the immunization program. Frontline health workers will be first in line to get inoculated “to preserve and protect our healthcare system,” according to the President.
The next on the priority list would be the poor and vulnerable sectors, other frontliners, and essential public and private workers including overseas Filipino workers and low-income earners.“Wala itong diskriminasyon (there is no discrimination),” Duterte said about the distribution of the vaccines.
“All will have their vaccines. I assure you. Mayroon lang tayong unahin — yung mga kawawa,” he added.
Shortly after Russia offered to supply vaccines to the Philippines last year, the President volunteered to take the first vaccine shot as a gesture of trust and gratitude to Moscow.He later quipped that he was willing to get inoculated in public to boost confidence in vaccines.
Recently, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the President wanted to be vaccinated by both drugs made by China and Russia.
But since this is not possible, Roque said Duterte might receive the vaccine shot developed by China since it is expected to be the first vaccine to arrive in the country this year. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

This after Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said Filipinos cannot afford to be picky with COVID-19 vaccines.“Pwede ba maging choosy sa Manila? Pwedeng pwede (Is it okay to be choosy in Manila? Very much so),” Domagoso said in an interview with DZRH on Wednesday.
“Everybody will be given opportunity to choose. Malaya. Sapagkat hindi natin pupwedeng isubo ‘yung kaning mainit na iluluwa lang ng tao (Free. Because we cannot feed them hot rice that they will just spit out),” he added.
The Manila city government has entered an agreement with British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for the advance purchase of 800,000 COVID-19 vaccines.But Domagoso said they will procure more vaccines from other companies should there be any available.After announcing that the country has secured 25 million vaccine doses from Chinese biopharmaceutical company Sinovac, Roque said Filipinos should not be picky because there are a lot of people in the country who have to be vaccinated.
“Totoo po, meron tayong lahat na karapatan para sa mabuting kalusugan pero hindi naman po pwede na pihikan dahil napakaraming Pilipino na dapat turukan (It’s true, we all have a right to good health but we should not be choosy because there are so many Filipinos who need to be vaccinated),” he said in a public briefing.The government has earned flak from lawmakers and the public for their apparent preference for CoronaVac, Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine, despite it reportedly being more expensive than other vaccines. It has also yet to apply for an emergency use authorization with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The Manila mayor said the public should not be blamed for being hesitant to be vaccinated because they may not be properly informed about the properties of the vaccines.
He said he will not allow the distribution of a vaccine that has not applied for emergency use authorization in the city.
“Kailangan may EUA katulad sa bansang kanilang pinanggalingan (They must have an EUA like in the country from which they came from)…it has to have that kind of permit,” he said. “‘Pag walang EUA, hindi ko ilalatag (If they do not have an EUA, I will not allow it).”
However, Domagoso also appealed to the public to “continue to believe in the system” and have themselves vaccinated against COVID-19.
“While it is true na mayroon tayong mga agam-agam (that we have our hesitations), we will continue to believe in the system and we will act in synchrony with the national government,” he said.“Labanan natin ‘yung fear kasi pinangarap natin ‘tong lahat, pinangarap natin na dumating na ‘yung bakuna (We must fight our fears because we all dreamed about this, we dreamed that a vaccine will come),” he added.

“Bukas nga po ay aming pipirmahan, lalagdaan po namin ang tripartite agreement ng more or less 20 million doses para sa AstraZeneca (We will sign Thursday a tripartite agreement for more or less 20 million doses from AstraZeneca),” Galvez said during a televised public briefing Wednesday.Under the tripartite arrangement, Galvez said the responsibility of the local government units is “to administer the vaccine” in coordination with the Department of Health. The national government, on the other hand, will handle the cold chain requirement and other supplies needed for the immunization.
The country has already secured supplies of 30 million doses of Covovax vaccines and an additional 25 million doses from China’s Sinovac, which are expected to be shipped this year. Negotiations are ongoing with other vaccine makers like Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson.
“Maganda po ang ating negotiation at mayroon na po tayong tinatawag nating conclusive final agreement na puwede nating pirmahan any day from now (Our negotiation are good and we will have a conclusive final agreement that we can sign any day from now),” Galvez said.

The Manila City government began constructing its coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine storage facility at Sta. Ana Hospital on Wednesday.
In an interview with CNN Philippines, Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso said the Manila COVID-19 Vaccine Storage Facility will measure around 100 square meters.
It will hold the 12 refrigeration units that the city government recently bought to store various COVID-19 vaccines. Domagoso said the refrigeration units can store the vaccines at normal to subzero temperatures.The Manila mayor said he chose the hospital as the site for the storage facility because even when there are power interruptions, the hospital has power generators that can protect the integrity of the vaccines.He also instructed members of the city government to coordinate with Meralco to ensure the steady power supply at Sta. Ana Hospital, he said in an interview with DZRH on Wednesday.Domagoso said he is hoping that the construction of the said facility will be finished within the month, before the arrival of the city’s initial supply of COVID-19 vaccines.
Domagoso inked a deal earlier with British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for the advance purchase of 800,000 vaccines that will benefit 400,000 residents.The Manila city government allocated a P250-million budget for the procurement of the said vaccines.
Frontline health workers, barangay health workers, senior citizens and members of vulnerable sectors, public school teachers, and those who pre-registered at the manilacovid19vaccine.com website will be prioritized in the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines.
As of Wednesday, up to 67,000 people have pre-registered and reserved their slots for the vaccine.Eventually, the city government will offer the vaccine to everyone, even if they are not residents or workers of the capital city, the local chief executive said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sen. Joel Villanueva on Wednesday called on the intergency task force handling the COVID-19 pandemic to start coming up with a “clear-cut” masterlist of the beneficiaries of the governement’s COVID-19 immunization program.

Villanueva said this would prevent any problems in the selection of those who who will be in the priority list for the inoculaton given the limited supplies of the coronavirus vaccines.
“The IATF (Interagency Task Force on the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases) should start drawing up guidelines as early as now so that we can maximize the distribution of the vaccines given the limited supply. A person could easily fall under two and more categories, so there must be a clear set of guidelines on this,” he said in hs statement.“We do not want overlaps in the priority list. Given the limited supply, we must ensure that each dose goes to the rightful beneficiary,” he reiterated.
The government plans to begin the immunization program in late February, with the aim of vaccinating 50 million of 70 million Filipinos within this year.
Its initial priority list was comprised of frontline health workers, indigent elderly and other remaining senior citizens, remaining indigent Filipinos (12.9 million), and uniformed personnel.
The IATF later expanded its target beneficiaries to include essential workers, such as those in transportation, public utility, seafarers and overseas Filipino workers.Villanueva said the IATF would have to identify that additional beneficiaries as he noted that about 25 percent or about 10 million of the country’s 39.8 million employed workers were identified in the October, 2020 Labor Force Survey as being part of “elementary occupations.”
The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) says they are those involved in unskilled labor such as “street vendors, cleaners, domestic helpers and farm hands.”
PSA data also shows that about seven million workers are in sales or service occupations.“While unemployment eased in October to 8.7 percent or about 3.8 million jobless workers, we must understand that the people also stopped looking for work. The slump is getting into the heads of our workers, and the vaccination program will help boost both the confidence of workers and our businesses as well,” said Villanueva, who chairs the Senate labor committee.
“We cannot afford to drop the ball on this. The stakes are too high. Our country’s economic recovery depends largely on this,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Stressing the need for a swift and efficient whole-of-nation approach in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, opposition Sen. Francis “Kiko” N. Pangilinan said Wednesday that the key solution to a more efficient vaccine roll-out is to involve the local government units (LGUs) and the private sector to enable the Philippines reach inoculation targets.
Senator Francis Pangilinan (Photo from Kiko Pangilinan website / kikopangilinan.com / MANILA BULLETIN)
“Bakit ayaw nilang bigyan ng authority ang private sector at LGU (local government unit) na bumili ng vaccine at magkaroon ng mas efficient at mas masigasig na vaccine roll-out? I think that is a key solution. If we will just let the Department of Health (DoH) bureaucracy be the primary and sole vaccine roll-out bureaucracy, I doubt that we will be able to reach our targets,” Pangilinan said. (Why does the government refuse to give the private sector and the LGUs authority to buy vaccines for an efficient and efficient vaccine roll-out?)
In a media interview, Pangilinan, who is the main proponent to convene the Senate Committee of the Whole (COW) to probe the country’s vaccine roll-out program, stressed that the bureaucracy needs a sense of urgency to be able to effectively deliver.“Kung aasa lang si (if we rely) on Galvez on DoH bureaucracy, he might as well be a general without an army…I have no doubt Gen. Galvez has what it takes to make this work, but he needs the DoH (to have his) sense of urgency. The lack of sense of urgency is clearly displayed in the last 11 months,” Pangilinan said, referring to Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., who is pandemic national action plan chief implementer and the so-called vaccine czar.
“How do you get the bureaucracy to have a sense of urgency? You get the LGUs involved, you get the private sector involved. Let the LGUs and the private sector be the gas pedal to the roll-out,” he added.
Pangilinan, who was Presidential Assistant on Food Security and Agriculture Modernization during the Aquino administration, said that at the time he was able to tap the bureaucracy under his command – the National Food Authority (NFA) and the Philippine Coconut Authority – when he needed to address the issues of fake plastic rice and “cocolisap” or coconut infestation.
He said that absent this bureaucracy in Galvez’s Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), stakeholders with organizations on the ground should be tapped.“You have to infuse the bureaucracy with the new blood, different and fresh pillars. That would be the LGUs who have shown their response to be very relevant in many of these different localities, as well as the private sector,” Pangilinan said.
Asked about how the Senate would be able to help allow the LGUs to directly purchase the vaccines, the senator said that it could be done by ensuring proper safeguards.
“Provided that there are enough safeguards in terms of coordination, reporting. For example, the government could focus on the 24.6 million most vulnerable, then the remaining 50 million puwedeng private sector and the LGUs. It’s a matter of being able to orchestrate things properly. And that requires matinding timon (efficient helmsman),” Pangilinan said.He said the DOH could enable these stakeholders by deputizing the LGUs and the private sector.
“In the end, it’s really the DoH’s call. Kasi sabi nga nila they can deputize. Ibig sabihin, it’s now up to the DoH to let go of some of its powers and enable the stakeholders. Enable the local governments. Enable the private sector. And get more involved in the roll-out,” Pangilinan said.
“This is a mass vaccination. DoH and the government cannot do it alone. Again, you have to have LGUs involved. You have to have private sectors involved,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Coronavirus vaccines may not yet be available for commercial use in the country this year.
According to Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, people cannot yet buy the vaccine in the market since the emergency use authorization (EUA) to be given by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not cover commercial use.

The government has so far secured millions of supplies from vaccine makers Covovax, Sinovac, and AstraZeneca, that are expected to be delivered to the county this year. Frontline health workers, seniors, poor citizens, and uniformed personnel will be among the priority beneficiaries of the government’s free COVID-19 vaccines.“Hindi po, dahil na-explain na ito ng FDA head natin, si Director General Domingo, na these vaccines because of the novelty ‘no, itong bagong bakuna na ito, mga bakuna that’s available, they apply for emergency use application dito sa bansa. And an EUA is actually not for commercial purposes (No, FDA head director general (Eric) Domingo has explained these vaccines, because of the novelty of these vaccines available, they apply for emergency use application in the country and an EUA is actually not for commercial purposes),” Nograles said during a televised press briefing Tuesday, when asked if the vaccines will be available in the market this year.
Given the limited vaccine supply that will be for emergency use, Nograles explained that any acquisition will go through the national government. He said local government units and the private sector could forge supply deals with the manufacturers but under a tripartite arrangement with the national government
“When the LGUs speak to the pharmaceutical companies, it’s also through a tripartite agreement with the national government na kasama doon sa tripartite agreement na iyan only because the unique characteristics of the vaccines that are available specifically for COVID-19 is an EUA application not just in the Philippines but in the entire world,” he said.
“Lahat ng binibigay ng mga FDA ng iba’t ibang mga bansa is EUA (The FDAs in other countries give only EUA) and by the nature of the emergency use application, it is only through the national government. Why? Because, again, there is a limited number of vaccines available,” he added.Nograles said around 70 million Filipinos could be vaccinated under the programs initiated by the national government, local government, and the private sector. At least 75 billion will be set aside by the national government for the acquisition of the COVID-19 vaccines.
Of the 25 million COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinovac, an initial 50,000 doses will be shipped to the country next month. The remaining supply will be delivered in the following months.
Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Gamaleya have pending applications for EUA before the local drug regulators. Once the EUA is granted, the government can start to administer the drugs for its massive immunization drive. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Vergeire said that only COVID-19 vaccines that will undergo the stringent evaluation of the Philippine health regulators will be procured by the government.

“Sa ngayon po ay ini-expect ng ating national government na, hopefully, bago matapos ang first quarter, makapag-umpisa na tayo makapagturok. Sinisiguro lang natin na safe ang vaccine na bibilhin,” Go said during an ambush interview right after he personally led the distribution of assistance to hundreds of fire victims and tricycle drivers in Obando, Bulacan.
(The national government hopes to begin inoculating with COVID-19 vaccine before the end of the first quarter. It is making sure that the vaccine to be bought would be safe)As chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, Go said that he would see to it that the poor and vulnerable sectors would be prioritized for the vaccine.
Go urged the government to ramp up its information dissemination campaign to build vaccine confidence among Filipinos.
“Ang info campaign, paigtingin pa, at dapat maintindihan po ng bawat Pilipino kung ano bang benepisyo nitong vaccine na ito dahil marami pa pong kababayan natin ang takot at ang attitude, nagtuturuan, kayo muna mauna dahil takot pa sila,” he said, urging vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. to ensure the safety, efficacy, and adequacy of supply of the vaccines.
(In this information campaign, every Filipino should understand the benefits of the vaccine because many of them are afraid and their attitude on vaccination is “you first’’ because they are afraid)Go urged concerned agencies to ensure the systematic distribution of the vaccines.
“Ang distribution ng vaccine, dapat aabot po sa pinakasulok ng Pilipinas. Tayo sa Metro Manila, mauuna tayo dahil nandito ang storage. Pero paano po ang mga kababayan natin sa pinakasulok ng Pilipinas? Paano aabot sa kanila ang vaccine?” he asked.
(The distribution of vaccines must reach every corner of the country. Here in Metro Manila, we will be first because of the presence of cold storage. How about our countrymen in far-flung areas? How will the vaccines reach them?)“Dapat pag-aralan na ‘di sila mahuhuli, lalo na po ang mahihirap, ni pambili wala po, ni access wala po,” he added.
(Government must study that they would not be left behind, particularly the poor, those without funds and those without access)
To also help ensure a more efficient distribution of vaccines, Go said that he supports the move of some local government units (LGUs) to sign deals for the purchase of their own vaccines through a tripartite agreement.
He urged Galvez to formulate a process which would expedite the vaccine procurement of LGUs.
Go added that the government must guarantee the safety and efficacy of all the vaccines they are procuring on their level so that the public would not find the need to choose their own vaccines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Grace Poe on Tuesday slammed as “outrageous” the signing of an agreement between the Philippine government and Chinese drugmaker Sinovac for 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of its product.
Senator Grace Poe (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
A day after the Senate Committee of the Whole’s first hearing on the government’s immunization plans, Poe said “questions still linger in the people’s minds as to why the government sealed an agreement with Sinovac when it’s not FDA-approved.”
“We recall earlier pronouncements that government is not entering an agreement with Pfizer or AstraZeneca because tests have yet to be conducted or concluded,” she said in a statement.“This is outrageous. Why is Sinovac being favored when it only has 50-percent efficacy and the least transparency?Who are they trying to favor or appease?” she lamented.
Senator Leila de Lima also said: “If Sinovac is so good, how come no private companies or LGUs purchased it for their people? Even Davao City got AstraZeneca.”
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced during his briefing Monday that the government has secured 25 million doses of vaccines from Sinovac Biotech, which reportedly committed to deliver an initial 50,000 in February.
During the Senate inquiry, Senate President Vicente Sotto and Senator Panfilo Lacson, however, asked why the government concluded a contract with Sinovac although the FDA has not yet issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for its vaccines.National Task Force against COVID-19 chief and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. explained that the agreement was only a “term sheet” so the country could “lock in” supply logististics from the vaccine maker.
“There is still a very rigorous supply agreement that will be tackled in order to determine the term of payments and also the terms of delivery,” Galvez said, explaining that it was “the model of advanced market commitment” that they are following.
Sinovac has yet to apply for an EUA pending the results of its clinical trials in Brazil and Turkey, according FDA director general Eric Domingo.“Not even an EUA, they have not applied and yet to concluded a contract to deliver 25 million doses…Why would you even negotiate with them? When several others have already applied and their EUAs are forthcoming?” Lacson pressed.
“Why would you give preference to a brand that has not even applied for EUA?”
Galvez, in response, said this is to prevent the country from being “at the tail end of the supply chain” for COVID-19 vaccines. “There is some sort of competition,” he said.
He said Sinovac will not deliver the vaccines next month “if the EUA [application] is not approved.” He further clarified: “The delivery will be delayed until the EUA is approved.”
In the same hearing, Galvez said the majority of the vaccines secured by the Philippines will come from the United States, the United Kingdom and India, followed by China and Russia.A bulk of these will be supplied by US pharmaceutical firm Novavax, which committed to deliver 30 million to 40 million doses to the country, he said.
Reports said that the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinovac showed a general efficacy of less than 60 percent in its clinical trial in Brazil, although Sau Paulo’s Butantan biomedical center dismissed these as “purely speculative”. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Deputy Speaker and Cagayan de Oro Rep. Rufus Rodriguez made this appeal to the national government Tuesday even as dozens of LGUs around the country have already signified their intention to procure the life-saving drug in huge quantities.
“The government’s priority right now should be having as many Filipinos as possible vaccinated in order to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, get the economy on the road to recovery, and return the nation to pre-2020 normality,” said Rodriguez, who filed House Resolution (HR) No.1460 for the purpose of his appeal.He said LGUs throughout the country should be allowed to import vaccines for their constituents since the national government can only answer for the vaccination of 30 to 50 percent of the country’s population.
Rodriguez said that over 30 provinces and cities have already allocated funds for anti-COVID shots approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with the cities of Makati, Quezon City, and Taguig setting aside P1 billion each from their local budget.
He added that even small provinces like Biliran and Eastern Samar are raring to procure vaccines with allocations of P100 million and P500 million, respectively.
The Mindanao lawmaker had earlier filed HR No.1453 prodding the government to let private businesses procure COVID-19 vaccines for their employees and their families.He said allowing LGUs and private companies to buy their own vaccine will greatly help the national government in achieving its goal of herd immunity from COVID-19, which calls for inoculating at least 80 percent of the population.
Rodriguez has also filed a bill to exempt vaccine importation from duties, taxes, and other fees.
Although the FDA has yet to approve the use of any vaccine, many LGUs have already negotiated with vaccine producers for their supply. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“The planned rollout of vaccines is good news that impacts not only the health of our people but also the economic well-being of our country,” he added.
Nograles said the President and the Cabinet wanted to ensure the country has “enough funds” to cover the needs for the vaccines to protect Filipinos from the coronavirus. “We are confident to be able to cover that many Filipinos and that’s enough for herd immunity,” he said.
The government has so far secured supplies of 30 million doses of Covovax vaccines and 25 million Sinovac vaccine doses. Additional vaccines from AstraZeneca have also been obtained by the national government, local government units, and private companies.The initial shipment of the Chinese-made vaccines is expected next month.
Upon the orders of the President, frontline health workers, senior citizens, poor citizens, and uniformed personnel are included in the list of priority beneficiaries of the government’s free vaccination program.

In a statement, PAMALAKAYA said it will carry out its own education drive using the available scientific information on the necessity of the vaccines in fishing communities.This is given the public’s fear of vaccines brought about by the Dengvaxia scare a few years back.
On Tuesday, the group also slammed the Duterte government’s lack of a comprehensive vaccine plan, by allotting a measly P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccine on the approved 2021 budget, or a mere 2.7 percent of the total P72 billion required budget to vaccinate at least 60 percent of the population for free.
“With consideration to the efficacy and safety of the vaccines being developed by established pharmaceutical companies, we demand that a significant segment of the working population be inoculated as a long-term solution to the pandemic,” PAMALAKAYA National Chairperson Fernando Hicap said in a statement.
“It is now the national government’s crucial and urgent responsibility to ensure that a large number of the population is immunized from the virus disease to let the affected workers get back to the wheels of production and go on with lives,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Due to stumbling blocks, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon believes that the government’s target of securing 148 million doses of vaccines to inoculate 70 million Filipinos against COVID-19 by the end of 2021 will be difficult to achieve.
Senator Franklin Drilon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
Drilon said the government’s COVID-19 vaccination plan “is good on paper” but “the plan is filled with uncertainties and it leaves too much to chance.”
“Parang suntok sa buwan ang vaccination program lalo na yung sinasabi nila na 148 million doses within the year,” Drilon said in a statement on Tuesday, a day after the Senate Committee of the Whole conducted an inquiry on the status of the national government’s COVID-19 vaccination plan.“The arrival of the vaccines is not even definite. How can they say that they will be able to purchase 148 million doses by the end of 2021 when up to now, we haven’t given any Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to any vaccine and we have not been able to raise, through loans, all the needed amount for the purchase of the vaccines?” Drilon said.
The minority leader also said he is skeptical over the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) assurance that it is ready to issue an EUA within the week for Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo, during the hearing, said Pfizer has applied for an EUA and the agency is expected to issue one in one to two days.
“I am not reassured in the slightest by what I heard. To be honest, I am more confused now. The government’s COVID-19 vaccination plan fails to provide the public the assurance they need from the government,” Drilon said.
He said vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr.’s statement that 80 percent of the global supply has already been procured by rich countries makes the government’s target of securing millions of doses simply difficult to achieve.
“If only the government was able to make advanced purchases last year, similar to other low-and-middle income countries such as Indonesia and Brazil, maybe we would have a better chance of securing these 148 million doses of vaccines this year,” he added.
Drilon said the only way the government can achieve its target of inoculating 70 million Filipinos is by allowing the local government units (LGUs) and the private sector to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies for the purchase of the vaccines that they had issued an EUA to.He said this would expedite the purchase of the much-needed vaccines. “I believe there is a consensus among the senators insofar as lifting these restrictions is concerned,” he said.
“They have a better chance of achieving the targets if they lift the restriction that they set that prevents local chief executives and the private sector from buying vaccines directly from the manufacturers,” the senator said.
The Senate minority chief also said that funding for the procurement of vaccines is not even guaranteed at this point as the government has not fully secured the necessary loans to fund the P70-billion.
The government has allotted P82.5-billion for the purchase of the vaccines but only P12.5-billion is in the programmed appropriation. At least P2.5-billion will come from the 2021 General Appropriations Act (GAA) and another P10-billion under the extended Bayanihan to Recover As One Act or Bayanihan 2. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

And as a piece of good news for their families back home, many of the Asinganian health workers in UK have shared that they have already received vaccines for the dreaded disease amid the alarming report of another surge in COVID-19 because of a new variant.
“Masaya naman na nabakunahan na at least may protection sa bagong variant ng COVID-19 (We’re happy that we have been vaccinated. At least we will have protection against the new variant of COVID-19),” said Edwin Agpaoa, who has been working as nurse in UK for more than 20 years.
Municipal Information Officer Romel Aguilar told The Manila Bulletin that there were more than 100 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) from Asingan who are currently frontliners in the UK.
And many have reportedly called home to say that they feel more safe now that they have been administered their vaccines.
But while this piece of good news may have drawn a sigh of relief back home, the Asinganian frontliners in UK are not letting their guard down.
“Suppose to be magpa-party ang mga Asinganian last December, hindi natuloy kasi naging careful kami and ngayon lockdown na naman kami for the third time kasi dumadami uli yung cases ng COVID at saka marami pa rin ang namamatay mostly above 60 [years old],” Aguilar said, quoting Asinganian nurse Edwin Agpaoa, who works at the Medway Maritime Hospital.(We were supposed to have a party for Asinganians last December.

Lim also said that he wrote a letter to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases that the city has already allocated an initial P10 million to purchase the vaccine.He said once the vaccines arrive, high-risk individuals in the city, such as frontliners, will be first priority for innoculation.
Vulnerable sectors, such as senior citizens, will follow.

While the Department of Health appreciates the effort of local government units (LGUs) in securing vaccines against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it said that LGUs cannot procure and roll out a vaccination program on their own without coordinating with the national government.
(Daniel Schludi / UNSPLASH / MANILA BULLETIN)
In a joint statement, the Department of Health (DOH), the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that local government units (LGUs) “cannot procure and roll out COVID-19 vaccines on their own.”
“This must be coordinated with the national government, through the NTF and the DOH in a tripartite agreement involving local governments and pharmaceutical companies,” the Health department said.
“This is meant to align the efforts of LGUs with the vaccine initiative of the national government which integrates and consolidates all resources and initiatives,” it added.
The FDA clarified that the emergency use authorization issued by the Philippine FDA does not cover the commercial use of the vaccines.
“This means that manufacturers cannot sell directly to the LGUs nor to any entity, unless they are under the vaccine initiative of the national government,” it said.
The Health department said it recognizes the equity issues raised on the distribution of the vaccine. “We assure the public that the national government adheres to the principle of equity where delivery of services are biased towards the vulnerable and the disadvantaged.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senators on Monday asserted that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should allow the private sector and local government units (LGUs) to procure COVID-19 vaccines directly from vaccine manufacturers.(Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
This would help the government in its efforts to combat the pandemic and restore economic activity faster.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III, Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto and Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said it is imperative that the FDA consider this and remove from the government the monopoly of purchasing the COVID-19 vaccines.
“Bakit ang national government gusto i-monopolize ang pag-purchase (Why does the national government want to monopolize the purchase? Bakit di na lang payagan yung (Why not allow the) LGUs at private sector to do their own purchases?” Recto said during the Senate Committee of the Whole’s inquiry into the status of the government’s COVID-19 vaccination program.
“I understand that the COVAX facility would be cheaper, but if this is a whole-of-nation approach, payagan na rin yung private sector. Kung willing sila magbayad ng mas mahal, na iba ang presyo sa COVAX facility—yan yung national government—tapos pribado, (f they are willing to pay a higher price, different from the price offered by the COVAX facility—which will be done by the national government—then the private (sector), they can have their own importation or the LGUs for that matter,” he said.
“Bakit di na lang payagan ng FDA yan or ng national government? (Why can’t the FDA or national government allow it?)” Recto further pointed out.
Drilon agreed with Recto saying he cannot understand why the government would authorize the use of about 70 million Filipinos using the COVID-19 vaccines to be procured by the state through an emergency use authorization (EUA) with FDA and yet refuse to apply the same process to the private sector and the LGUs.
“The premise…is that at least the EUA is a prima facie certification that the vaccine is safe and effective. In fact, it is because of that EUA that we would authorize the use of about 70 million Filipinos because there is prima facie finding that it is safe and effective. Why can’t this prima facie finding to be made to apply to the private sector and the LGUs and allow them to acquire these vaccines also in the same basis of a EUA so that the national government can be assisted in acquiring these vaccines and make it available to our people,” Drilon pointed out.
“The issue here is why is it that the national government would want to impose this rule of an EUA that would give birth to a monopoly, which is not good as a matter of policy,” the minority leader stressed.
FDA director general Rolando Enrique Domingo, however, said it is important that the procurement of the vaccines must go through the national government because the products would only be issued with EUA for local distribution in the Philippines.
“It takes about seven years to procure a vaccine and they can only apply for a certificate of product registration or marketing authorization once that these three trials are completed,” Domingo explained.
Domingo further said that vaccine manufacturers would not take responsibility for their products, while the national government will take responsibility for using a product that is still under development.
“Naniniwala naman po kami na kailangan naman po talaga ng LGUs at ng private sector (ng mga vaccines) kaya nga po ginawan natin ng paraan para sila maka-access sa through DOH (Department of Health),” Domingo said.
“Kasi yung mga kumpanya po talagang malalaki ay hindi po talaga magbebenta sa mga LGU at mga private company. Kasi yun pong kanilang produkto under development pa at hindi pa sila ready na i-market ito, ” he reiterated.
But senators pointed out that some LGUs have already procured COVID-19 vaccines for their respective constituents due to the government’s slow procurement process.
Sotto and Sen. Risa Hontiveros cited the case of the Makati City Government which has already secured 1 million doses of vaccines from AstraZeneca for its citizens.
Sen. Cynthia Villar agreed with Drilon and Recto’s position saying the government should not wait for the country’s economy to collapse before allowing the LGUs and the private sector to acquire COVID-19 vaccines based on their own efforts.
“Kasi kung iintayin pa natin yung third quarter… paano yung first and second quarter ng (Because if we’re going to wait for the third quarter, what happens to the Philippines during our first and second quarter) Pilipinas in terms of economic activity and employment?

(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
The Philippine Medical Association, the national organization of physicians licensed to practice medicine in the country, urged government agencies and pharmaceutical companies to fully disclose data related to the approved vaccines especially those pertaining to the rate of effectiveness as revealed during test and clinical trials, and its adverse reactions.
“The data will be used as the basis for physicians to make the necessary medical evaluation and diagnosis on patients,” the organization said.
They also suggested that COVID-19 vaccines be distributed to all public and private hospitals having storage facilities preserving the efficacy of the vaccines in order “to hasten the vaccination program and to encompass as wide a coverage as possible.”
The organization also lauded the pronouncement on prioritizing medical frontliners in the nationwide vaccination program.
“This will enable medical professionals to fully and without fear participate in the program and attend to patients requiring medical attention,” the medical experts said.
It also expressed commitment to assist the Philippine government for the nationwide vaccination program.
In a position paper, the Philippine Medical Association said it would take steps for its participation in the vaccination program such as conducting an information campaign to increase public awareness as to the need for the vaccination.
They also vowed to assist in the vaccination complying with the government list of priorities; monitor the effects and adverse reactions of patients who are already vaccinated; and report to the Department of Health whatever adverse reactions and other information gathered by individual physicians during and after the vaccination.

Kabayan party-list Rep. Ron Salo believes that the Philippine government should partner with different sectors in the procurement and distribution of anti-COVID vaccines for the daunting endeavor to be a success.

“The sheer magnitude of this undertaking to inoculate all Filipinos in such a short span of time requires a whole of system and a whole of society approach. Neither the government nor the private sector can successfully undertake it alone,” Salo said Monday.
The first order of business is to bring the foreigner-made vaccines to Philippine shores in the most efficient way possible, the solon said.“I think that procurement of COVID-19 vaccines should be undertaken by the government in partnership with international organizations such as the WHO (World Health Organization) and the UNICEF (United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund),” he said.
“This will achieve at least two things: We will be able to benefit from decreased cost associated with bulk procurement, as well as benefit from the expertise and moral ascendancy of these specialized international organizations,” the former UP law professor noted.
Salo said once the country secures its deals for vaccine supply, the challenge of storing and distributing the drug must then be addressed. And it’s no easy task given the nature of the vaccine, he said.
“The storage, distribution, and administration of these vaccines to our people should be undertaken by the government in partnership with the private sector,” he said.American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which jointly developed an anti-COVID vaccine with German biotech firm BioNTech SE, said their particular vaccine must be kept at a temperature of negative 70 degrees Celsius for 10 days if unopened. This raises the need for local cold storage facilities to ensure that the procured antigen won’t go to waste.
Incicentally, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is among the most promising and sought-after by countries due to its 95 percent efficacy rate claim.
Pfizer has designed distribution containers that can be used for temporary storage in a vaccination facility, such as a hospital, for up to 30 days as long as they refilled with dry ice every five days. Once thawed, the vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator at two to eight degrees Celsius for up to five days.“We need to synergize the efforts, resources, and expertise of both the public and the private sectors to ensure the success of this massive undertaking,” Salo pointed out.

The President is eager to get inoculated against the coronavirus using both vaccines made by China and Russia but he would have to choose only one, according to presidential spokesman Harry Roque.
The country’s initial supply of COVID-19 vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech is expected to arrive in the country starting next month. At least 25 million Sinovac vaccine doses have been secured by the Philippine government for delivery this year.
“Si Presidente malinaw. Gusto niya magpaturok agad, gusto niya Tsino at Russian. Ang tinatanong niya kung puwede pareho.

Take it or leave it.
The priority beneficiaries of the government’s free coronavirus vaccines can neither choose the brand of life-saving drugs they want to receive or be forced to get the vaccination, Malacañang said Monday.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque (OPS / MANILA BULLETIN)
As the government steps up its vaccine acquisition efforts, presidential spokesman Harry Roque explained that beneficiaries could either accept or decline the vaccine offered by the government. A waiver of right will be signed by the beneficiary if he or she declines the free vaccine, he added.The issue on vaccine rights was recently discussed by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).
“Napag-usapan na ‘yan. Hindi pa covered ng IATF resolution pero parang mayroon ng consensus. Wala pong pilian, wala kasing pilitan (It has been discussed. It is not yet covered in an IATF resolution but there appears to be a consensus. They cannot choose which brand because they are not forced to be vaccinated),” Roque said during a televised press briefing when asked if Filipinos can choose the vaccines purchased by the government.
If a beneficiary refuses to take the free vaccine, Roque said the person must sign a waiver that will renounce his or her priority status for free vaccination. He admitted that people could not afford to be picky when it comes to vaccines since many others want to get inoculated against the virus.
“Pero magsa-sign ka ng waiver na hindi ka nagpaturok. At kapag ikaw ay merong prayoridad, siyempre mawawala ang prayoridad mo. Sasama ka doon sa the rest of taumbayan na nag-aantay ng bakuna (But you will sign a waiver that you will not be vaccinated. And once you decline, you will lose your priority status. You will join the rest of the people waiting for the vaccine),” he said.“Tama lang naman po ‘yan. Walang pilian kasi hindi naman natin makokontrol talaga kung ano ang darating at libre po ito. Pero ganun po ‘yan there is such a thing as waiver of a right. Totoo po, meron tayong lahat karapatan para sa mabuting kalusugan pero hindi pupuwede na pihikan dahil napakadaming Pilipino na dapat turukan (It is only right. We cannot choose because we cannot control which vaccines will arrive first and besides, these are free. But there is such a thing as waiver of a right. It is true that we all have the right to good health but we cannot be picky because many Filipinos need to be vaccinated),” he added.
Under the government’s free vaccination plan, frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens and other seniors, indigent population, and uniformed personnel will be the first to get inoculated against the virus. The priority areas for the immunization drive are National Capital Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Region 11 (Davao region), and Region 4-A (Calabarzon).
Earlier, Roque announced the government has secured 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from China’s Sinovac that will be delivered this year. The initial shipment of 50,000 doses will arrive next month. The Palace official repeatedly assured the nation that the Chinese-made vaccines are proven safe and effective in clinical trials abroad.Earlier, around 2.6 million coronavirus shots from British vaccine maker AstraZeneca have been finalized by the government.

“What are they aiming for?”
This is the question posed by Vice President Leni Robredo’s spokesman, Ibarra Gutierrez, in reply to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque’s claim that the government is already working to address the Filipinos’ fears of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Kung ‘ginagawa’ na pala, at 47% pa rin ng mga Pilipino ang ayaw magpa-bakuna, at 32% lang ang bukas, hindi ba kulang ang ginagawa? Ano ba hinahabol niyo, participation award?” Gutierrez said in a Twitter post.(If they already doing it (communication) and 47% of Filipinos don’t want to be inoculated with the vaccine, and only 32% are willing, doesn’t it mean that what (they’re) doing is not enough? What are they aiming for, (a) participation award?)
Roque answered Robredo’s earlier suggestion to ramp up communication efforts to allay people’s fears about the vaccine.
The presidential spokesman said that the government is already doing what the vice president has been suggesting.
But Gutierrez was referring to the Pulse Asia survey which showed that only 32% of Filipinos who participated in the survey would get themselves inoculated if the vaccine is already available. About 84% of those unwilling voiced concerns about the safety of the vaccine.The same survey showed that in Class E, 56% are unwilling to be vaccinated with 79% of them saying the primary reason is the vaccine’s safety, 10% are concerned that it may not be safe, and 9% believing that the vaccine is not needed to fight the virus.

He said the Chinese-made vaccines must obtain emergency use authorization from local regulators before the government will start to administer the drug to priority beneficiaries.
The government had earlier identified health frontliners, seniors, poor citizens, and uniformed personnel as among the priority sectors who will receive the free vaccines.“We can do what Indonesia did — accept the delivery and wait for the approval (by the) regulatory authority,” he said.
Roque assured the public that the CoronaVac vaccines, a vaccine developed by China’s’ Sinovac Biotech, have been tested for safety and efficacy in clinical studies.
He said Turkey, which ordered three million doses of Sinovac vaccine, attested that China’s vaccines are 91.25 percent effective and did not see any major side effect.
Thailand has also acquired two million shots of China’s Sinovac while Indonesia has obtained 125.5 million doses.
Indonesian studies also found Sinovac has 91.25 percent efficacy rate, Roque said.
“The clinical trials done in West Java and Turkey show that Sinovac vaccines are safe and effective,” he said in Pilipino.
Roque took a swipe at government critics who have voiced doubts about the government’s vaccination plan.
“To the enemies of the government, be silent. It will blow up in your faces. When the survey results come in, you’ll perform badly, you’ll get zero, you’ll be a failure again,” he said in Pilipino.
Choose one
Roque said President Duterte may receive the Sinovac vaccine since it will be first to arrive in the country.
The President is reportedly eager to get inoculated against the coronavirus using vaccines made by China and Russia but he would have to choose only one, according to Roque.
“Si Presidente malinaw. Gusto niya magpaturok agad, gusto niya Tsino at Russian. Ang tinatanong niya kung puwede pareho. Ang tingin ko ‘hindi’ so kailangan mamili ang presidente kung Sino o Russian ang kanyang papaturok (The President is clear. He wanted to be vaccinated by the Chinese and Russian-made vaccines. He has been asking if it is possible to get the two vaccines. I think this is not possible. So the President has to choose between the vaccines made by China and Russia),” Roque added.
Under the government’s free vaccination plan, frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens and other seniors, indigent population, and uniformed personnel will be the first to be inoculated against the virus.
The priority areas for the immunization drive are the National Capital Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Region 11 (Davao region), and Region 4-A (Calabarzon).
Roque said priority beneficiaries cannot choose the brand of life-saving drugs they want to receive or be forced to be vaccinated.
They can either accept or decline the vaccine offered by the government. If a beneficiary refuses to take the free vaccine, Roque said the person will sign a waiver that will renounce his or her priority status for free vaccination.
Many others want to get inoculated against the virus, he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

BACOLOD CITY – The cities of Sagay, Cadiz and Himamaylan in Negros Occidental have set aside funds totaling P121 million for the purchase of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines.
Sagay City Mayor Alfredo Marañon III, said they will set aside P40 million, while Cadiz City Mayor Salvador Escalante said the city government has an initial budget of up to P80 million for the vaccines.
Himamaylan City Mayor Rogelio Raymund Tongson Jr. said they have allotted an initial P1 million.Earlier, Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson urged cities and towns in the province to set aside funds for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, even as the provincial government had also allotted P30 million.
Talisay City Mayor Neil Lizares said the city was ready to allocate funds for the purchase of vaccines for teachers and senior citizens.
Meanwhile, Mayors Pedro Zayco of Kabankalan City, Nicholas Yulo of Bago City, and Rex Jalando-on of La Carlota City said they already have the budget to purchase the vaccines, and were set to have a meeting with country’s vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez on January 12.

Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez on Monday told the Senate Committee of the Whole that the bulk of the COVID19 vaccines that will be made available in the Philippines will come from US pharmaceutical company Novavax.
Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the NTF Against COVID-19, signed a “term sheet” with the Serum Institute of India (SII) and its Philippine partner, Fabreco Life Sciences last Saturday, January 9, to nered with Novavax, a US-based biotechnology company to develop and commercialize the Covavax vaccine.

“The vaccine has the recombinant coronavirus spike protein nanoparticle and a Novavax-patented Matrix-M adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Covovax is in third-stage trials and is expected to be approved for use by international regulators,” the NTF said.The Covovax vaccines are expected to arrive in the country in the third quarter of this year.
“Our main volumes will be coming from Novavax with 30 to 40 million doses,” Galvez said during the hearing.
“For Pfizer, we are negotiating for higher volumes of more or less 40 million; AstraZeneca 25 to 30 million doses, and Sinovac and Gamaleya for 25 million each,” he said.
He said the government can start rolling out its COVID-19 vaccination program in February possibly using either Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, or the Sinovac from COVAX, the global facility vaccine procurement and distribution effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.He said the Philippines might be receiving more or less 40 million doses from COVAX for 20-30 million people.
Galvez, however, said that 80 percent of the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines has gone to rich countries.
“The reality is that more than 80 percent of global supply has already been pre-procured by rich countries,” Galvez said.“We are now trying our best to negotiate with different vaccine companies to get a fair share of the vaccines for the remaining 18 percent of the global supply,” he added.
He said the government will proceed with the procurement of the vaccines using the budget appropriated under the national budget for 2021 and the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2), through bilateral financing or government to government financing, tripartite agreement, and multilateral arrangements with major financial institutions such as the World Bank (WB) and Asian Development Bank (ADB).
Galvez also assured that the government will prioritize frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens, remaining senior citizens, remaining indigent population, uniformed personnel, teachers, social workers, overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), and other essential workers outside of the health, education, and social welfare sectors in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program.
Covovax thoroughly evaluated Dr. Luningning Villa, medical director of the Faberco Life Sciences, said the Covovax vaccine was “thoroughly evaluated” in different geographies, various age groups, racial and ethnic minorities, and other groups that were most affected by COVID-19 including people living with HIV.
“The vaccine will be used to vaccinate 15 million vulnerable and poor Filipinos. The vaccine is stable at 2°C to 8°C, the standard temperature that is within the existing cold chain system in the Philippines, thus allowing its distribution to the remotest barangays,” Villa said.She said that Covovax has undergone clinical trials involving a sizable population of around 50,000 subjects “to ensure extreme robust clinical data prior to approval by relevant regulatory bodies including the WHO.”
The candidate vaccine underwent the initial phase of its clinical trials in Australia, South Africa, and India, Villa said. She added that a phase three clinical trial is also being carried out in the United Kingdom with 15,000 subjects; and in the United States and Mexico with 30,000 subjects, respectively.
Around 50 to 70 million Filipinos are targeted to be vaccinated this year as the government steps up its efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
Currently, at least three companies have already applied for an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the country. These are Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Russia’s Gamaleya.
LGUs acquire AstraZeneca vaccine doses

Senators are asking about the national government’s alleged preference for the vaccine of Chinese firm Sinovac for the rollout of its immunization program against COVID-19.
(SENATE FACEBOOK / MANILA BULLETIN)
Senate President Vicente Sotto III on Monday raised the government’s reported preference for Sinovac while several local government units (LGUs) have started entering into agreements with other pharmaceutical firms.
“Bakit ang pinipili nila — may nabalitaan ako, ewan ko kung totoo ‘yon — balita ko pinili na ‘yong Sinovac…Bakit ‘yun? (Why are they choosing — I have heard reports, to verify it — that they reportedly have chosen the Sinovac. Why?),” Sotto said in an interview over radio DZBB.“Tanungin natin bakit ‘yun, anong efficacy n’un (Let’s ask them why, what is the efficacy of their vaccine). Bakit ‘yong mga LGUs ang kinakausap AztraZeneca (Why are LGUs choosing to talk to AztraZeneca)?” he added.
The Senate Committee of the Whole has started its inquiry on the government’s COVID-19 immunization program which will also raise the delays in the Philippines’ procurement of coronavirus vaccines.
“Bakit hanggang ngayon wala pa tayo (Why don’t we have the vaccine until now)?” he asked, noting that over 20 countries have begun inoculating their population.
Senator Panfilo Lacson had earlier questioned what he believed was a preference for Sinovac, recalling the Health Secretary Francisco Duque’s belated responses and actions on the negotiations with Pfizer and Sinopharm last year.“Are they waiting for a particular brand?” Lacson said in Filipino. “What’s special about Sinovac? Why does it appear that we are waiting for it?”
Senator Joel Villanueva also echoed this concern, saying during the hearing that even doctors doubted the efficacy of Sinovac’s product and would refuse to be injected with it.
Sotto, in his opening statement, also noted that “the slow approval of those in charge in the government may have prompted some to acquire the vaccines sans the required authority from the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).”The Senate chief said that with the hearing, “the committee and the people will be well-informed of what lies ahead in further containing this alarming pandemic.”
“However, we can only attain this objective only if we have a well-coordinated, fully-planned, and a systematic distribution of vaccine in the country,” he pointed out, saying the country should prevent a repeat of the “inadequate” handling of the COVID-19 pandemic that led to an outbreak and increase in cases last year.

The city mayor clarified this after signing a multilateral agreement with British pharmaceutical firm AztraZeneca and the national government Sunday for procurement of the COVID-19 vaccines once it becomes available in the country.
While Treñas earlier announced that all city residents will be vaccinated for free, the mayor withdrew his earlier statement, and said the AztraZeneca AZD1222 vaccines that will be purchased would only be good for 300,000 people.The World Health Organization (WHO) has earlier recommended that each person undergoing COVID-19 vaccination must have two doses for it to be effective.
The city government allocated at least P200 million for the procurement of the 300,000 vaccines.

US President-elect Joe Biden will receive his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, his office announced, three weeks after his first injection was broadcast live on TV to boost public confidence in the jab.
Biden, 78, told Americans “there’s nothing to worry about” when he got his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at the Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware on December 21.
His team said that his second jab would also be done in front of the media, without giving further details.More than 374,000 people have died from the coronavirus in America, and Biden on Friday slammed President Donald Trump administration’s troubled distribution of vaccines as a “travesty.”
About 6.7 million Americans have so far received their first shot — far short of the target of 20 million by the end of 2020.
But 22.1 million doses have been distributed nationwide, underlining the logistical challenge of getting the injections administered to the elderly and health workers who are the priority.
Both vaccines currently authorized in the US, developed by Pfizer and Moderna, require recipients to receive booster shots after three and four weeks, respectively.Biden, who will be inaugurated on January 20, plans to release every available dose of vaccine, rather than holding back half to make sure people receive their booster shots on time as is the current protocol.

“Marami sa atin ngayon nagdadalawang isip, medyo may konting kaba. Pero naitindihan natin ‘yun kasi bago eh (Many of us are hesitant, a little nervous. But we understood that because this [vaccine] is new),” he added.
But he assured that the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca is safe because the United Kingdom has approved it for use.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on January 6 that the drug maker has already submitted an application for the emergency approval of its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines.
“Kaya kailangan magtiwala po tayo. Kung hindi dahil sa mga bakuna, e di marami parin ngayon may polio, may small pox, may tigdas.

With the vaccines for COVID-19 already available and in fact being rolled out in some countries, we in the city government are inviting all the residents of Manila to register for the free vaccination we intend to implement once the vaccines reach us.
Since we launched the registration about a week ago via www.manilacovid19vaccine.com and invited the citizens of Manila to register, more than 55,000 have already heeded our call as of this writing.Through an ordinance earlier passed by the Manila City Council headed by Vice Mayor and Presiding Officer Honey Lacuna and Majority floorleader Joel Chua, we were able to allot initially P200 million which we now raised to P250 million, for the purchase of the vaccines. This would be on top of the vaccine allotment by the national government for the city of Manila and modesty aside, we are ready to increase the allocation to up to P1 billion if opportunity allows.
Since the health of the city’s populace is our foremost concern, we ask for the indulgence and patience of residents if they do experience potholes on the streets.
We in the city government have decided to cancel certain infrastructure projects and instead had the budget realigned for the city government’sCOVID vaccination program which is part of our working plan for the next six months.There is this need to sacrifice major infra projects to be able to respond to the primary needs of our citizens.
Our gratitude goes to President Rodrigo Duterte and National Action Plan vs COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr. for all the support that Manila had been getting in the fight against COVID-19.We also thank and laud the President for having issued last December 1 Executive Order 121 which authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue emergency use authorization (EUA) to expected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) drugs and vaccines that will be made available in the Philippines.
Following talks with Pfizer and AstraZeneca that began as early as July last year, we were able to enter into a non-disclosure agreement and succeeded in securing an initial 400,000 doses of vaccines,enough to cover 200,000 residents.
As per guidance from the World Health Organization and the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), medical frontliners will be prioritized in the vaccine rollout, to be followed by senior citizens and finally, the general population of Manila.I am happy to announce that along with Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna and the Manila Health Department under Dr. Poks Pangan, among others, we have held meetings to polish the plans for the vaccination processes while completely following the mandated protocols.
In urging Manilans to register for free vaccination slots, such will be on a voluntary basis only. All processes and vaccines that will be used will be in accordance with what is mandated by the regulatory agencies of the national government.
While the vaccine is still on the way, free swab and serology testing will continue to be given in the various designated centers in the city. Thus, we urge those who feel they have been exposed to a virus carrier, are experiencing symptoms, or merely want to have peace of mind to take advantage of the COVID-19 tests being given by the city government free of charge.
There is nothing to lose in submitting to these free COVID tests, for one’s very own safety and and those of their loved ones.Besides, certificates will be issued and these can be used by those who are returning to work and are being required to present a certificate stating that they have been swabbed and are found to be negative for COVID-19.
Under the process, the person tested will have to stay at the quarantine facility while awaiting the result which is released within 24 hours. The facility, by the way, is equipped with airconditioning units, wifi and we even serve free food.We have 14 quarantine facilities in the city that are fully functional and ready to accept those who wish to get tested. Early detection is key to better chances at recovery and preventing community transmission.
In the meantime, I am reiterating my previous and oft-repeated appeal to all my fellow Manilans to continue being alert and practicing minimum health protocols. And do register to get a slot in the upcoming vaccination.
I don’t mind sounding like a broken record but let me stress, once again, thatCOVID-19 is still in our midst and in fact continues to claim precious lives.

The Caloocan City government signed an agreement with British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for the purchase of 600,000 coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccines that will be distributed for free to the city’s residents.Caloocan City Mayor Oscar “Oca” Malapitan announced on Sunday night that 300,000 residents will benefit from the initial supply of vaccines.“Tuluy-tuloy ang ating paghahanda para sa pagbili ng bakuna kontra Covid-19. Nakikipag-ugnayan tayo sa mga pharmaceutical company upang matiyak na makakakuha tayo ng bakuna pag ito ay aprubado na ng Inter-Agency Task Force at Food and Drug Administration (We are continously preparing to buy vaccines against COVID-19. We are coordinating with pharmaceutical companies to ensure that we will acquire a vaccine when it is approved by the IATF and the FDA),” he said in a Facebook post.
Earlier, Malapitan said that the city government earmarked a budget of P125 million for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.
He also said that they will borrow an additional P1 billion to ensure that each resident will receive a free COVID-19 vaccine.
The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine requires two doses for it to be effective. Each dose costs $10 or around P500.

Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri on Sunday disclosed that the Senate is planning to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for its employees and staff.

Zubiri said the Upper House is taking its cue from the House of Representatives which would be utilizing P50-million from its internal funds for the COVID-19 vaccination of its employees, staff, and five of their immediate family members, and members of the media covering the Lower House.
“Yes, nakuha natin ang idea sa (we got the idea from the) House of Representatives. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. Ginagawa na yan ng LGUs (the local government units are already doing it too),” Zubiri said in an interview over Radio DZRH.
Zubiri said he suggested the same to Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the latter agreed with his proposal.
“Para makabalik din kami sa normal sa Senado. Kung nabakunahan na po ang kanilang staff at pamilya back to normal na kami. Pwede na kami mag face-to-face. Napakahirap kasi gumawa ng batas via Zoom; mahirap interventions pag online (So we can go back to normal in the Senate. If the staff and their family are vaccinated, we can go back to normal. We can conduct face-to-face hearings. It’s very hard to craft laws via Zoom. There are many interventions when you’re online),” the Senate Majority leader said.
“Tama rin sinabi n SP na there’s proposal na makabili rin ang Senado. Dahil ang private sector nakaorder na. Ako nagsuggest nito kay SP if ordinary companies are getting vaccines bakit di kami (The Senate President was right with the proposal for the Senate to also procure for its own because those in the private sector have already ordered. I made the suggestion to him that if ordinary companies are getting vaccines, why can’t we?),” he pointed out.
While some government officials have frowned on the idea of allowing LGUs to buy COVID-19 vaccines for their respective constituents, the senator said no one could question their motive since the national task force against COVID-19 still has no clear policy direction to provide solutions to their woes.
“Wala tayo magagawa kailangan nila gumalaw dahil wala tayong clear policy para mabigyan solusyon ang kaba ng LGU (We can’t do anything. They need to do something because we have no clear policy to solve the anxiety of the LGUs),” he noted.
“Kung tatanungin mo ako dyan (If you ask me) let’s do a parallel move. Tuloy-tuloy pagplano ng gobyerno sa pagpasok ng bakuna para maibigay nila ng libre. Walang problema dyan meron tayo P72-billion para dyan. Kung gusto ng private sector halimbawa, Red Cross kung gusto nila magpapasok, allow us to do so kasi meron din kami chapters pwede rin tayo maglagay rollout program. It’s similar sa (COVID) testing (The government can pursue its plan to procure vaccines so they can give it for free. There’s no problem with that, we have P72-billion for that. If the private sector, like the Philippine Red Cross also wants to procure its own COVID vaccines, allow us to do so, because we also have chapters and we can rollout the program, similar to our COVID testing),” said Zubiri who is vice chairman of the PRC.
Asked how much money the Senate will allot for the procurement of its own COVID-19 vaccines, the senator said they would still have to ask Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who chairs the Senate Committee on Accounts. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The acquisition of coronavirus vaccines will be a challenging task but the government is determined to explore all means to secure the country’s supply, according Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo.
(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Panelo has dispelled allegations about the government’s alleged slow procurement of vaccines, citing the early allocation of resources to obtain such supplies. The procurement of vaccines would be a “continuous effort” since it is essential to protect Filipinos from the coronavirus threat, he assured the public.
“To this end, the government is exploring all possible avenues as well as partners, both international and domestic, to obtain the vaccines necessary for our citizens,” Panelo said in an interview with Manila Bulletin.“Our government cannot, by any means, be characterized as slow in securing vaccine doses. The vaccination of our people has been identified as the end goal from day one, and accordingly, manpower and resources werealready allocated for the accomplishment of the task,” he said.
Vaccine procurement however won’t be a walk in the park. Panelo acknowledged there is a growing demand for the COVID-19 vaccines.
“Procurement of a finite supply that is so much in demand will be fraught with challenges,” he said.
“Nevertheless, our government, through the leadership and direction of our vaccine czar, Secretary Charlie Galvez, is focused on his new task and will tirelessly see it through,” he said.Galvez earlier said the government aims to buy 148 million doses of coronavirus vaccines for an initial 50 to 70 million Filipinos this year. Negotiations are ongoing with vaccine makers like Novovax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Sinovac, and Gamaleya. Galvez said he hopes the supply deals could be finalized this month.

Top government officials who will get vaccinated for coronavirus disease must not be done in secret to build public trust on its safety, Vice President Leni Robredo said on Sunday, Jan. 10.

During her weekly radio show, Robredo said the public must know when officials will get a vaccine once it becomes available because hiding it from the people only adds to their fears.
Robredo cited the public vaccination of US President-elect Joe Biden and outgoing Vice President Mike Pence, as well as Pope Francis and Britain’s Queen Elizabeth who both joined the global vaccination program against COVID-19.“For me, our top officials should not get vaccinated in secret. They should show the people they have nothing to fear [with vaccines],” she said in Filipino.
The vice president stressed the priority list for those to be vaccinated should be strictly followed.
Apart from local governments willing to spend for vaccines, she also urged private companies to invest in vaccines to help the national government in its COVID-19 immunization campaign.
Robredo noted the importance of the private sector’s contribution to the national vaccination program.The Philippine government recently signed an agreement with the private sector for the purchase of two million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.
Half of the vaccines, which are expected to arrive later this year, will be donated to the government, while the other half will go to private sector employees.
Still, the vice president made the call to private companies as more local government units (LGUs) nationwide have allocated funds to buy COVID-19 vaccines.“We also encourage companies that can spend for the vaccination of its own employees to invest,” she said in Filipino. “Because every company and LGU that would invest, it would help everyone.”
Robredo is hopeful that local governments unable to procure a vaccine on their own will not be the last priority in the immunization drive.
“We don’t want to it happen that an LGU will be at disadvantage if it can’t buy a vaccine. The distribution, which I think will be done, must be more equitable,” she said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

State-run Finlay Vaccine Institute (IFV) and the Pasteur Institute of Iran signed an agreement in Havana that will see a Phase 3 clinical trial in Iran, to “move forward faster in immunization against Covid-19 in both countries,” the IFV announced on Twitter.
The news came on the heels of Iran’s supreme leader on Friday banning the import of American and British-produced vaccines against Covid-19, saying they were “completely untrustworthy.”Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a tweet, accompanied by the hashtag #CoronaVaccine: “It’s not unlikely they would want to contaminate other nations.”
The Islamic republic has reported more than 1.2 million cases of the novel coronavirus, which have caused over 56,000 deaths.
It has accused arch-enemy the United States of hampering its access to vaccines through a tough sanctions regime.
The Sovereign 02 is the country’s most advanced coronavirus vaccine candidate, showing “an early immune response (at 14 days),” IFV Director Vicente Verez said in December.It has been difficult to do Phase 3 clinical testing in Cuba because its outbreak has not been as serious as those in many larger countries, he said.
Although cases in Cuba are increasing due to the opening of its borders, the country of 11.2 million has seen about 14,000 cases and 148 deaths, lower figures than its neighbors in the region.
The Americas’ only Communist-ruled state wants to have its entire population immunized with its own vaccines by the first half of 2021.The Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology is working on two other vaccine candidates, called Mambisa and Abdala.Cuban scientists have experience in developing and manufacturing vaccines.

Valenzuela City will have its COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca, Senator Sherwin T. Gatchalian said today.
During a DWIZ radio interview, Gatchalian said this was relayed to him by his brother, Mayor Rex Gatchalian.
Mayor Gatchalian told his brother that would sign within this week a contract with the foreign pharmaceutical firm for the delivery of the vaccine.The vaccine to be delivered would cover some 300,000 residents or 40 percent of Valenzuela’s population, Sen. Gatchalian said.
Sen. Gatchalian said the vaccine of AstraZeneca is cheaper and easier to distribute compared to other foreign vaccines.
He also said there is a competition among nations in trying to negotiate for the sale of the vaccines.
Sen. Gatchalian asked aloud the effects of the difference on the ability of rich local government units (LGUs) to buy COVID-19 vaccines and the inability of poor LGUs to buy their vaccines.
He said he would pose this question at the start of the public hearing Monday by the Senate constituted as a Committee of the Whole (COW) on the purchase, distribution, and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines to millions of Filipinos throughout the country, Congress had set aside P72.5 billion for this program.

DAVAO CITY – Vaccine-maker Astrazeneca Pharmaceuticals (Philippines), Inc. has committed to deliver an initial batch of its coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines to the city government of Davao by the third quarter of this year, Mayor Sara Duterte said on Friday.
During her live program over Davao City Disaster Radio (DCDR 87.5), Duterte said that she had already signed the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the company on Thursday and met with its executives Friday.
She said the local government will procure the AZD1222, the vaccine jointly developed by the British firm in collaboration with Oxford University, through the national government.She added that vaccines will be delivered in tranches since Astrazeneca could not supply it in bulk.
Duterte said the local government is targeting to inoculate 1.2 million Dabawenyos to achieve herd immunity.
The discussion between Duterte and Astrazeneca took place a day after the City Council of Davao approved an ordinance granting authority to the local chief executive to begin the transactions with Astrazeneca for a supply of COVID-19 vaccines.
She said the local government pursued discussion with the British drugmaker since it was the only firm ready to sign a contract with any local government unit (LGU).But she added that thelocal government will also negotiate with other vaccine-makers for additional supply of vaccines.
She said she is set to meet with another vaccine-maker, also on Friday.
She said the city’s supply of vaccines will augment the nationwide vaccination program, targeting the individuals who are not in the priority list of the national government.Based on the priority eligible groups of the national government, priority will be given to frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens, remaining senior citizens, remaining indigent population, and uniformed personnel.
She said the local government did not set a ceiling on the budget for vaccines since it will also negotiate for more supply from other pharmaceuticals.
“What we will do (is) we will talk to as many vaccine-makers as possible, especially those who have the intent to apply for EUA (emergency use authorization) or certificate of product registration in the Philippines, and ask them if they can deliver to us this number of doses and if they say yes, then, we will start the process of contracting with them,” she said.
Duterte assured that the local government will procure available vaccines from different vaccine-makers.
As of January 7, the Department of Health (DOH)-Davao Region recorded 13,321 total COVID-19 cases, with 1,707 active, 11,064 recoveries, and 550 deaths.Of the total cases, Davao City reported 9,325, Davao de Oro with 618, Davao del Norte with 1,684, Davao del Sur with 990, Davao Occidental with 131, and Davao Oriental with 573.

This was announced by Mayor Evelio Leonardia at a press briefing here, following the ceremonial signing of a multilateral agreement with AstraZeneca and national government agencies, and a confidentiality agreement with AstraZeneca at the Bacolod City Government Center on Thursday.
AstraZeneca is a multinational pharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, England, which has partnered with the University of Oxford in developing a vaccine against COVID-19.“It is our policy, our belief, and our commitment that when the health and lives of our people are at stake, we will go for broke,” Leonardia said.The mayor stressed that the city government was committed to providing its citizens with any duly approved vaccines that would be available in the market.
This was the reason why city officials are making all necessary efforts to raise the needed budget, according to Leonardia.
“We are willing to augment, to re-align, and to revert all items in our budget if the need arises,” Leonardia said, adding that they will be starting with the preparation of P300 million for the vaccines.
“We will make adjustments if necessary,” he said.
Leonardia was authorized by the City Council to contract with AstraZeneca to avail of the company’s vaccine in a special session held last Wednesday.
Prior to that, officials of League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) headed by Leonardia as national president and the LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment, chaired by Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas, met with top officials of AstraZeneca in a virtual dialog.
Taking this “major step” further, Leonardia also wrote the council on Thursday to give him continuing authorization to enter into contracts with other pharmaceutical companies legally operating in the Philippines which can provide COVID-19 vaccines duly approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
According to the mayor, he made the letter-request because time was essential in procuring the vaccine.“We are very serious. We have to move fast and act fast,” he stressed, adding that he will not allow the people of Bacolod to be left out come the time the vaccines are already available.
Leonardia said that the City Health Office and the COVID-19 Vaccination (CoVac) Council have started drafting the list of persons who shall be vaccinated first in Bacolod.
The list will be finalized in accordance with the guidelines set by the Department of Health and the National Inter-Agency Task Force Against COVID-19 for identifying the priority sectors in mass vaccination.Leonardia clarified that local government units (LGUs) cannot independently procure COVID-19 vaccines without clearance from the national government.In his letter to the SP, he said: “The availability of the COVID-19 vaccine is limited, and considering the massive nationwide demand for it, we are bound to encounter problems in its timely availment if we do not act now to ensure that we are on the list of LGUs which are ready to availof any vaccine supply that the national government shall be able to procure under existing policies and procedures, and subject to adjustments that the national government may eventually adopt thereon.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Malacañang denied its involvement in the move of the Congress to restart deliberations on charter change, saying President Duterte’s priority now is addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque (OPS / MANILA BULLETIN)
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement following reports that House Speaker Lord Allan Velasco instructed House constitutional amendments panel chair Alfredo Garbin to tackle proposed amendments to economic provisions in the Constitution.
Pro-Duterte senators Francis Tolentino and Ronald Dela Rosa, meanwhile, are pushing to change provisions on “democratic representation and the economic provisions of the Constitution.”In his Thursday presser, Roque said that it was Congress’ duty to discuss possible amendments to the Constitution and that they do not need President Duterte’s go-signal to do it.
“Alam niyo po hindi naman kinakailangang bigyan ng basbas ng Presidente ‘yan. ‘Yan naman po ay katungkulan talaga ng Kongreso (You know, they don’t need the President’s blessing to do that. That is part of their job),” he said.
“Tanging Kongreso lang po ang pwedeng magsimula ng proseso para sa Charter Change, hindi po ang presidente (It’s only Congress who can start the process of charter change, not the president),” he added.
Changing the form of government to the federal system was one of President Duterte’s promises when he was still campaigning for the presidency in 2016.New priority
However, Roque said that President Duterte now has a new and more important priority: addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Sa ngayon po, ang number one priority natin ngayon ang COVID-19 lalong-lalo na ang usaping vaccine (For now, our number one priority is the pandemic especially getting vaccines),” he said.“Wala pong ibang top priority ang Pangulo kung hindi ang matapos ang pandemiyang ito sa pamamagitan ng pagbibigay ng bakuna sa ating mga kababayan (The President has no other top priority than putting an end to the pandemic by vaccinating the people),” he added.
Despite this, Roque said they respect the move of the Congress.
“That is the sole constitutional prerogative of Congress and we respect that,” he said.
No term extension
The Palace official likewise dismissed claims that the move to revive talks on charter change was aimed to extend the terms of officials, particularly that of the chief executive.“Wala pong katuturan ‘yang mga tsismis na yan. Tsismis lang po ‘yan (There’s no truth to those rumors. Those are just rumors),” Roque said.
He reiterated that President Duterte himself does not want to go beyond his term of office.
“The President has made it clear: Wala po siyang kahit anong kagustuhan na manatili ng isang minuto man lang (He has no desire to stay even for just a minute) beyond his term of office on June 30, 2022,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Malabon City government has allotted a total of P200 million for the purchase of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccines to be administered to around 90,000 city residents.Dr. Roberto Romero, Malabon City Health Department head, said the amount can secure enough vaccines to be distributed to up to 30 percent of Malabon’s 366,000 population.
Malabon Mayor Antolin “Lenlen” Oreta III said priority will be given to health workers, residents working outside the city, senior citizens, students, and immunocompromised individuals in the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Our city doctors are ready to carry out the clinical task, in accordance with guidelines and directives of the DOH and other concerned national agencies,” he said in a statement issued on Thursday.“We are committed to fully protect our constituents from further virus contractions thru this vaccination along with the national government,” he added.Oreta said earlier that the funds will be sourced from the city’s Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (LDRRMF) and unused funds from the previous year.
He also said the city government does “not have enough funds for such an endeavor.”Several Metro Manila local government units have set aside budgets to procure their own supply of COVID-19 vaccines separate from the national government.
Health Spokesperson Ma. Rosario Vergeire told local government units to still coordinate with the national government to ensure the smooth procurement process of the vaccines.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sen. Francis Tolentino said Thursday that no law prohibits local government units (LGUs) from purchasing COVID-19 vaccines for their constituents.
Sen. Francis Tolentino (Albert Calvelo/Senate PRIB)
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Local Government welcomed President Duterte’s approval of a tripartite agreement among LGUs, the national government, and pharmaceutical companies for the procurement of coronavirus vaccines.
“The proactive approach by LGUs should not only be lauded but actively encouraged. There is more than sufficient legal basis for LGUs to procure COVID-19 vaccines for their own constituents,” Tolentino said.Several LGUs in Metro Manila have launched initiatives and set aside funds for the purchase and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in their respective jurisdictions.
Officials, however, said LGUs can only do the procurement through a tripartite agreement, since vaccine manufacturers deal with the national government, and only vaccines given the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may be purchased by the national government.
The senator said that under the Local Government Code, the LGUs have devolved powers which include the authority to provide basic health services compliant with standards and criteria set by the Department of Health (DoH).
“This devolution of power is consistent with the principle of decentralization and local autonomy enshrined in our Constitution, laws, and jurisprudence,” Tolentino said.“Hence, under the Local Government Code, municipalities and cities are mandated and empowered to deliver basic health services and facilities, such as implementation of programs and projects on communicable and non-communicable disease control services; access to secondary and tertiary health services; and purchase of necessary medicines, medical supplies, and equipment, including vaccines,” he added.
Tolentino said Duterte’s Executive Order No. 121, which authorizes the FDA to issue EUA for COVID-19 drugs and vaccines, and the FDA’s Circular No. 2020-036 prescribing the guidelines for its implementation, also do not limit the procurement of vaccines to the national government.
He likewise said that procurement laws allow LGUs to purchase “much-needed supplies during the pandemic, including vaccines, without having to go through the long process of a public bidding.”He said that under Republic Act No. 9184, or the Government Procurement Reform Act, procuring entities, such as LGUs, can engage in negotiated procurement in emergency cases, which cover “imminent danger to life or property during a state of calamity, or when time is of the essence arising from natural or man-made calamities or other causes where immediate action is necessary to prevent damage to or loss of life or property.”
Tolentino said the LGUs should be given a greater role in the government’s vaccination program.
Allowing them to purchase COVID-19 vaccines will make sure that all Filipinos, including those who are not among the national government’s priorities, are inoculated and in turn, achieve herd immunity against COVID-19.
He said the mass vaccination program “will only be successful with the cooperation and active participation of LGUs.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

BACOLOD CITY – Mayor Evelio Leonardia has been authorized by the Sangguniang Panlungsod (SP) on Wednesday to contract with AstraZeneca to avail of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The SP has also authorized Leonardia to sign the Confidentiality Agreement between AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals (Philippines) and the City of Bacolod on the proposed business arrangements for the availability and distribution of the vaccine.
AstraZeneca, a multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Cambridge, England, has partnered with the University of Oxford in developing a vaccine against COVID-19.Leonardia said the SP authority is a major step towards eventually availing of the vaccine for the people of Bacolod. He thanked the City Council for immediately granting his request for an authority to sign the non-disclosure agreement with AstraZeneca and the multilateral agreement between and among AstraZeneca, the national government through the National Task Force Against COVID-19, the Department of Health, and the City Government of Bacolod.
“We have to get the vaccines as soon as possible, and even if we just start with AstraZeneca, we can now say that the process for getting it is rolling,” Leonardia said.
The SP authority to contract with AstraZeneca came a day after the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP), headed by Leonardia as national president, and the LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment, chaired by Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas, met with top officials of AstraZeneca in a virtual dialog.
Leonardia said the city government will coordinate with the LCP to hold exploratory talks with other pharmaceutical companies regarding the procurement of COVID vaccines.He revealed that the LCP officials and the LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment will hold a virtual dialog with Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., who is also the chief implementer of the National Task Force, and officials of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on January 12 to discuss and synchronize the ongoing efforts of the national government and those of the cities on the vaccine procurement.
Based on the previous virtual meeting with Galvez last December 29, the national government is requesting that city governments allocate their funds first so that the national government can then efficiently and equitably distribute vaccines that it shall procure, with priority to be given to local government units (LGUs) with funding deficiencies and to areas where herd immunity is targeted.
Leonardia said the LCP is collaborating with the DOH, the Department of Budget and Management, and the Department of the Interior and Local Government to arrive at a consensual decision on the procurement of the vaccines, which, as of now, can only be done at the level of the national government. 
Leonardia said LGUs cannot independently procure the vaccines without clearance from the national government.
Galvez had earlier said the national government has earmarked P1.3 billion to buy at least 150 million vaccines for mass vaccination this year. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Panaligan said the city is eyeing at least 50,000 people or at least one-third of the city population under the P25 million initial budget for the vaccines.“It is important that cities start the vaccination as early as possible to end the COVID-19 pandemic so that city residents can return to normal, revive the local economy, and resume the education of the youth that was disrupted by the long quarantine,” Panaligan said. He expressed his support to the proposal of the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) that city governments be allowed to procure their own vaccines.
Panaligan said the LCP proposal has been approved by Malacanang but he stressed that LGUs will not be allowed to buy directly from the suppliers.Under a tripartite arrangement, it is the national government which has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to procure vaccines from manufacturers, the mayor said. Bacolod City Mayor Evelio Leonardia, LCP national president, has formed a committee chaired by Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Trenas to negotiate with the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), Food and Drug Administration, Department of Budget and Management, Department of Interior and Local Governments, Department of Health, and Vaccine Czar Gen. Carlito Galvez regarding their proposal. Panaligan, who is also the secretary-general of LCP, the national organization of cities in the country, said the purpose of LCP in coming up with this proposal is to ensure that cities can start the early vaccination of their constituents against thevirus now that there are already clinically tested and approved vaccines being administered in other countries.
 “City governments in the country are ready and willing to help the national government by allocating their own funds in the procurement of vaccines,” Panaligan said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

TACLOBAN CITY – After initially saying that the city government of Ormoc will be buying vaccines good for 30 to 40 percent of the city’s 240,000 residents with an estimated cost of P200-million, City Mayor Richard Gomez announced that the Ormoc City coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Vaccine Council (ORCOVAC) has decided to buy vaccines for at least 80 percent of the population.
The ORCOVAC said the city government has enough money to buy more. “The vaccination program is our priority this year,” Mayor Gomez said.
The Ormoc City COVID-19 Vaccine Council is a body created by Gomez on December 29, 2020, to study ways and means to implement the COVID-19 vaccination program. It is composed of top city officials and representatives of the private sector.Composing the task force are the mayor as chairman; Vice Mayor Leo Carmelo Locsin Jr. as vice chairman; Councilors Eusebio Gerardo Penserga, Peter Rodriguez, and Vincent Rama as members; and city health doctor Edmund Kierulf, city administrator Vincent Emnas, city legal officer Joy Mejia Romero, city budget officer Sabrina Duero, city treasurer Delia Vilbar, city accountant Rosario Serafica, city social welfare, and development officer Delia Corbo, city planning and development officer Raoul Cam, and infectious disease specialist Dr. Larsen Omolon, as members.
From the private sector, Gomez has also included Ormoc Chamber president Stephanie Diane Chu and the chief of private hospitals namely Dr. Gardenia Larrazabal of Ormoc Doctors’ Hospital, Dr. Jaime Gatchalian Jr. of Clinica Gatchalian and Hospital, and, Dr. Sandra Fiel-Chiong of OSPA-Farmers’ Medical Center as members.
Gomez said that some P350-million has been earmarked for the vaccination program. He said that he wants a 100 percent coverage, but added that the sum might just initially cover around 80 percent because “there will be other expenses like syringes, cotton, alcohol, storage, etc.”
The council, however, will meet again to decide on which vaccine to buy.Gomez expressed hope that as more pharmaceuticals race to have their vaccines get emergency approval, the prices will go down. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Antipolo City government has allocated a P300-million budget for the purchase of vaccines to fight the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), as announced by Mayor Andrea Bautista Ynares.
The city government is also planning to vaccinate all its residents on a voluntary basis.
In a post on her Facebook page, Mayor Ynares said the vaccines, which the city government ordered through the National Task Force Against COVID-19 and the Department of Health, will be arriving this year.Relly Bernardo, information officer of the city government told Manila Bulletin that the roll out for the vaccination program is targeted to happen in the third or fourth quarter this year.
Meanwhile, the city government has also extended help to balikbayans (returning Filipinos from abroad) and the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) by welcoming them in the city’s 31 isolation facilities.
To be accommodated for free with food and other hotel and dormitory provisions are returning Filipinos, city residents or not, from countries with travel restrictions because of the new coronavirus variant and required to undergo 14-day mandatory quarantine.
Ynares also said that balikbayans and OFWs who will be tested positive but do not have symptoms or those with mild symptoms can stay in the city’s quarantine facilities until they finish their 14-day quarantine. Others who are waiting for the release of their swab test, especially those that will have to travel to far provinces and still preparing their travel pass and other necessary documents, can also stay at the comfort of the city’s air-conditioned facilities.Those who would like to avail the offer of the Antipolo City government can contact the Antipolo City Health Office at telephone number 8-697-0362, for the necessary arrangement that can be made.

The government should boost its information campaign about COVID-19 vaccines ahead of its expected arrival in the country this year to help build public trust in getting immunized and achieve herd immunity.
This was the suggestion of OCTA Research Team fellow Dr. Guido David after a recent survey conducted by his group showed that only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents are willing to get immunized once vaccines against COVID-19 are already available in the country.
Out of the 600 respondents in the capital region, David said that 28 percent are unwilling to get the vaccine while the majority or 47 percent are still uncertain whether to get the shot or not.“We think isang factor kung bakit may uncertainty is yung mga tao gusto nilang magkaroon ng information about the vaccine, although sinabi sa survey question na safe, they still want to know saan manggagaling, ano ang efficacy, ano ang mga side-effects,” David explained in an interview on Wednesday.
(We think one factor why there is uncertainty is that the people want to have information about the vaccine, although the survey question said it is safe, they still want to know where it will come from, what is the efficacy, what are the side-effects.)
According to David, the numbers of those who are willing to get vaccinated should increase to around 60 to 70 percent even in the National Capital Region (NCR) only which is still the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the county.
David said information campaigns, as well as messages from the country’s leaders such as the Department of Health, will help in boosting these numbers and eventually reach herd immunity.Herd immunity, experts explained, is when it is less likely for citizens to contract the virus as the majority of the population will be protected.
The University of the Philippines (UP) professor noted that information drives on COVID-19 vaccines will also help the government to build public trust which he said is also essential in encouraging the people to get immunized.
“Possibly, kaya marami pa rin ang undecided ay dahil sa issue on Dengvaxia kung saan na-erode ng kaunti yung public trust to get a vaccine. That is why importante na marestore nag public trust,” David said.(It is possible that many are still undecided because of the issue on Dengvaxia which slightly eroded the public’s trust to get a vaccine. That is why it is important to restore public trust.)
“Kaya important na ang government natin ay makapagsecure ng vaccine that is safe and mataas ang confidence ng mga tao dito para ma-maintain ang public trust sa gobyerno,” he added.
(Our government needs to secure a vaccine that is safe and which people have high confidence with to maintain public trust in the government.)
National Task Force Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. recently said that COVID-19 vaccines will be made available in the country around March 2021 “at the earliest.”
The government has formally secured more than two million doses of vaccines from AstraZeneca which is expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2021, while negotiations with other foreign vaccine manufacturers are still ongoing. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The logistics sector has urged the government to tap the private sector storage and logistics expertise because they have enough capacity to handle the different temperature requirements of COVID-19 vaccines if only government will give the business to industry players and not do it on their own.
Michael Raeuber, chairman of the country’s largest integrated logistics firm Royal Cargo,lamented in an interview with Manila Bulletin Business that government is doing everything when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines, even the sourcing of transportation, setting aside the private sector’s expertise.
Michael Raeuber, chairman of the country’s largest integrated logistics firm Royal Cargo.“Anytime,” said Raeuber when asked if Royal Cargo and other players can accept storage and handling of COVID-19 vaccines. The problem is, he said, the government has not tapped the private sector and has not organized the supply chain. “There is no such thing as of now. The way I see it is government is trying to control everything, including the sourcing of transportation, apparently there is no private sector participation, no jobs given to anybody, not to my knowledge,” Raeuber said.Pfizer requires minus 70 degrees Celsius, but Royal Cargo has storage capacity for minus 80 degrees. The company has also unlimited capacity for Astra, which has temperature storage requirement of 2-8 degrees. Royal Cargo has also roughly 200 reefer trucks with generator sets that can be mounted on these units to ensure that temperature can go down to as low as 35 degrees. “We could pack Moderna vaccines in these containers and bring them anywhere in the country even in areas with no electricity, the only thing you need is diesel,” he added.
Royal Cargo’s P50 million cold storage capacity expansion at its main headquarters in Paranaque, just a walking distance from the international airport, is ongoing and is expected for completion in time for the arrival of the vaccines in this first quarter. (See related story: https://mb.com.ph/2021/01/02/royal-cargo-expands-facility-to-accommodate-vaccines/)
According to Raeuber, Royal Cargo has rotating capacity to handle the vaccines because it does not mean that everything will have to come at one time. “Let’s just say that if government asks for 800,000 units for Metro Manila in one day, we can handle that and then replenish and open to receive more, but you see this supply chain has to be organized,” he said.
Aside from Royal Cargo, he mentioned that pharmaceutical company Zuellig has also the capacity to handle COVID-19 vaccines, but it should be the government that should assign the task to the private sector.Raeuber noted that during a virtual vaccine debate, the government even erroneously stated that vaccines are only permitted or approved for emergency use, which means it is under full control of the government.“Number one, I don’t think that is correct because most of big vaccines have already been approved by many countries for use, not unrestricted use, not only for emergency use, and secondly, is government so effective that they can do all these by themselves,” he said.
He said the government should find out what the private sector can do and, secondly seek partnership with the private sector.“Do not underestimate the power of capitalism and commerce,” Raeuber stressed as he pointed out the already established pharmaceutical distribution system by various pharmaceutical firms with their own representative companies in the country.
“There is a complete private distribution system in the country already, tap this,” he urged noting that government doing it on their own is not efficient.
Raeuber has called for urgency on the inoculation of the population because of the dangers of the new strain of the virus. “Imagine with this more dangerous variation of COVID coming here and catch us by surprise so we really really have to accelerate this vaccination as soon as possible to prevent something like that to happen,” he said citing resurgence of infections in the EU and the US.
According to Raeuber the cost of COVID-19 vaccines varies. He said Moderna is between $25-35 while Pfizer is in the middle of $20-$15. Astra Zeneca is the cheapest at only $2.50 dollar, approximately P150 only, because it was developed by Oxford University and was given to Astra Zeneca, a British pharma company, on condition they have to keep the price down.

(ALI VICOY / MANILA BULLETIN)
The latest decision was reached by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) during a meeting Tuesday as vaccine distribution has started in some countries.
“Any individual arriving in the Philippines who may have received vaccination for COVID-19 in other countries/jurisdictions shall still be required to observe the mandatory testing and quarantine protocols,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque said on Wednesday.Local regulators have yet to give any emergency use approval to experimental coronavirus vaccines in the country although some public officials and military personnel have reportedly been inoculated.
So far, American drugmaker Pfizer is the only vaccine company that has a pending emergency use authorization (EUA) application before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A decision on the application may be released next week.
According to FDA director general Eric Domingo, United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca is expected to apply for EUA in the next few days.
The World Health Organization recently issued its first emergency use approval for the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, which is reportedly 95 percent effective after two doses. The latest WHO actions sought to help countries without regulatory processes to gain access to the vaccine.Some potential coronavirus vaccines have also been given emergency use approval in countries like the United States and United Kingdom. Another vaccine, developed by Sinopharm, became the first to be given general use approval by China.
The government has already allocated P72 billion for the acquisition and distribution of coronavirus vaccines under the 2021 national budget. Negotiations are underway to secure the country’s vaccine supply.
President Duterte previously said the Philippines seemed to be playing “second fiddle” to the vaccine acquisition since it is not a rich country.Under the government’s vaccination plan, around 24.6 million Filipinos will be given priority in its free vaccination program to fight the new coronavirus disease. Health workers, senior citizens, poor citizens, and uniformed personnel will be prioritized in the immunization drive.
The focused areas for the COVID vaccination campaign are the National Capital Region, Region 4A (CALABARZON), Region 3 (Central Luzon), Davao City, Cebu City, Cagayan de Oro, Baguio City, Bacolod, Iloilo, Zamboanga City, Tacloban City, General Santos City, and other affected places.
Roque said the IATF called for the government’s intensified communication campaign on efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Covered by the order are the Department of Health, Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Labor and Employment, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Information and Communications Technology, the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson, and the Presidential Communications Operations Office.
These agencies have been asked “to further strengthen their enforcement, monitoring, and communication efforts or impose additional specific measures to mitigate the possible holiday surge of COVID-19 cases,” Roque said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“As early as September, we have already started planning for vaccination, it will complement our other ongoing anti-COVID programs like our aggressive mass testing and treatment,” he noted.Cayetano said the city wants to make sure that its free testing in 30 health centers and two drive through sites continue throughout 2021.Taguig’s own molecular laboratory and disease surveillance units will also continue operating and will be funded in 2021.“We are working closely with the Joint Task Force and the Department of Health for the allotment of vaccines for Taguig but also already talking to suppliers for our own procurement once we are given the green light,” Cayetano said.
“We are also set to launch our model vaccine stations and [our] citizens ID this January. Both are important components of vaccine rollout plan,” he added.The city mayor reminded Taguigeños that while vaccination is important, it is just one component in the continued fight against COVID-19.
“We need to continue to be vigilant and be responsible,” Cayetano said.
“Balance between finally opening up all remaining aspects of the economy and getting people back to work; getting kids back to school and finally getting all aspects of society back on track will be the most important goals of 2021,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

According to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, acquiring the permit from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would help facilitate the vaccination of the rest of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) members.
Dr. Rolando Enrique Domingo, FDA director general, earlier said the agency can issue compassionate permits for the use of COVID vaccines in the absence of an emergency use authorization (EUA). Such special permits can be issued to small groups such as the PSG, considering their mission to protect the President, according to Domingo.“If I were to be asked for an opinion ng PSG, I would seriously advice PSG na sundin iyong sinabi ni Usec. Domingo, mag-apply ng special permit nang sa ganoon maturukan iyong lahat ng miyembro ng PSG (to follow what Undersecretary Domingo said, to apply for a special permit so all members of the PSG can be vaccinated),” Roque said during a televised press briefing.During a meeting with top government officials in Davao City Monday night, the President asked Domingo if the FDA could issue emergency clearance for the use of COVID vaccines. He noted that only American drugmaker Pfizer has so far submitted its application for EUA of its vaccine in the country.Domingo, who attended the meeting via video conference, informed the President about the issuance of compassionate special permit for certain unregistered drugs. The official said this was the “safe way” to facilitate the vaccination even without the EUA.President Duterte has defended the PSG’s use of unregistered coronavirus vaccines, saying it was a matter of self-preservation. He also prohibited the PSG from appearing in a Senate inquiry to avoid getting “brutalized” in the hearing.Duterte has also denied he was trying to cover up the controversial vaccination of his security team. He claimed that he was unaware about the PSG vaccination, including the brand of the drugs administered to his security personnel.PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III earlier confirmed that several PSG close-in security members received the COVID vaccines to advance their mission to protect the President. The President was supposedly only informed about the PSG vaccination afterwards.The PSG vaccination drew criticisms from many groups who inquired about the source of the alleged smuggled vaccines.

BACOLOD CITY – The provincial government of Negros Occidental has allocated P30 million from this year’s budget for the purchase of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
This was revealed by Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson who said that medical frontliners will be given priority in the vaccination.
Lacson said he has already signed a Non-disclosure Agreement with a pharmaceutical company, but he refused to give further details on the transaction.He said the fund could be sourced from the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) budget.
Lacson admitted that the amount may not be enough and may ask for an allocation from the national government.“I don’t know what the national government will give to the local government units (LGUs) – whether it is “an allocation or a grant,” the governor said.
The provincial allocation is aside from the vaccines to be purchased by the national government which will also give priority to the medical frontliners, vulnerable senior citizens, indigents and other frontliners like the military and the police.Lacson encouraged the LGUs, especially the cities, to also allocate funds for the purchase of the vaccines.

Agusan del Norte Rep. Lawrence Fortun welcomed on Tuesday the signing of the Alternative Learning System (ALS) Act, which he envisions to be useful even with the future rollout of anti-COVID vaccines.
(PIXABAY / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“Given recent developments, it does not look like we will see most students returning to their classrooms. Therefore, ALS modes will still be needed in school year 2021-2022,” Fortun said in a statement.
“At best, the older students—those from Grade 9 to Grade 12 and those in college—would have the best chances of returning to classrooms if they are vaccinated within this year. According to the disclosures and data of the vaccine manufacturers, their vaccines are not yet recommended for children. The youngest ages they suggested for vaccination are in the 15 to 18 (age groups),” he noted.Fortun was a member of the House contingent in the Bicameral Conference Committee on the ALS Act, which was reported to have signed into law by President Duterte Monday. The law was designated as Republic Act (RA) 11510.
“I thank President Rodrigo Duterte for signing into law these important reforms and milestone in alternative learning system. The law provides for bridging mechanism for ALS completers to higher education,” he said.
He said the new ALS law gives the Department of Education (DepEd) strong legal basis to make all the needed changes to its delivery modes while online class continue under the new normal.
Fortun said the ALS law had been pursued since the 15th Congress, but measures on it only prospered in the current 18th Congress after the COVID-19 pandemic made face-to-face classes for pupils untenable due to health risks.“Availment of the DepEd ALS or Alternative Learning System and lifelong education services is for free. The newly-signed ALS Law guarantees that all DepEd ALS programs are free and there shall be no solicitation or payments for any fees as a requisite for admission,” he explained.
He said that while DepEd has been practicing ALS for decades, there has been a growing need to update the system via legislation.
“Different ways of non-formal education shall be used to implement ALS, not just through online/ digital blended learning. The implementation modes depend on the situation of the learners. It is the DepEd that will adjust to the learner’s needs, not the learner adjusting to the DepEd,” Fortun said.The Philippines, unlike countries in the West, has yet to launch mass immunization efforts against the 2019 coronavirus.

“The NBI investigation will proceed as planned,” the secretary told reporters.
Guevarra made the assurance after President Duterte warned against subjecting the Presidential Security Group (PSG) under a congressional probe over reports that PSG security personnel got inoculated with the COVID-19 vaccines.The secretary explained the mission of the NBI is “to investigate the alleged proliferation of unregistered anti-COVID 19 vaccines and their unauthorized administration in the so-called black market.”
“The agency has several sources of information other than the PSG,” Guevarra pointed out.
On Monday, Jan. 4, Guevarra issued Department Order No. 314 which instructed the NBI “to conduct an investigation on the reported importation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, administration, and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines that are not authorized by or registered with the Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines, and, if evidence warrants, to file the appropriate charges against all persons involved and found responsible for any unlawful act in connection therewith.”
The secretary issued the order following revelations made by PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III that the PSG was able to get COVID-19 vaccines and have its personnel vaccinated to better protect Duterte from getting infected with the virus.Guevarra had already clarified that his order for the NBI to conduct the investigation was not prompted by the reports on the vaccination conducted on PSG security personnel.

“They should be treated as our modern day heroes,” said Bello.
“The minimum wage earners are movers of the economy that’s why we should maintain their health,” he added.
Bello said he already proposed the matter to the IATF.“I proposed it to the IATF. It’s already being studied. I hope they will consider because their contribution to the economt is really big,” he said.

“Tuloy ang NBI investigation dahil meron kaming order galing kay Sec. Guevarra na natanggap ng NBI kahapon (The investigation will push through because Justice Sec. Menardo Guevarra has already issued the order which the NBI received yesterday),” NBI deputy director and spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin said during an interview over CNN Philippines.
Lavin said the NBI’s Special Action Unit (SAU) headed by Atty. Emeterio Dongallo Jr. has been tasked to lead the investigation over reports of the alleged unauthorized use of the vaccine.The NBI spokesperson made the assurance after President Duterte warned Congress against subjecting the PSG under legislative probe over the alleged unauthorized use of the COVID-19 vaccine for the PSG security personnel.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) even called off its investigation over the issue regarding PSG’s use of the vaccines.
Under Department Order No. 314, Guevarra told the NBI “to conduct an investigation on the reported importation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, administration, and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines that are not authorized by or registered with the Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines, and, if evidence warrants, to file the appropriate charges against all persons involved and found responsible for any unlawful act in connection therewith.”
In the same order, the secretary also directed NBI Officer-In-Charge Director Eric Distor “to submit reports on the progress of the subject investigation directly to the Office of the Secretary within ten days and periodically thereafter.”Lavin believes that the President’s warning was only made against the plans to conduct congressional probes over the PSG’s use of the vaccine.
“Tuloy ang sa amin (Our investigation will push through) unless that order of the secretary is withdrawn,” Lavin said.
Lavin said NBI investigators will be reaching out to PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III “today or in the next few days maybe through the Armed Forces of the Philippines.”The spokesperson said Durante may come to the NBI, preferably with a lawyer, or send a lawyer instead.
“If a lawyer submits an affidavit, a letter, then that would suffice,” he assured.
On the other hand, if the AFP becomes uncooperative in the investigation, Lavin said the “we will build up the case on independent evidence.”
Aside from the PSG, the spokesperson said the NBI will also investigate other reports of unauthorized use of COVID-19 vaccines including the revelation made by Chinese-Filipino civic leader Teresita Ang-See that there have been around 100,000 Chinese in the Philippines who received shots of the vaccines, particularly, those in the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operation (POGO) industry.
“We also expect that we can reach out to Ms. Teresita Ang-See for her statement involving POGO quarters,” Lavin said.“Hopefully we can get enough information on that, their whereabouts, their identities, how it happened,” he added.
Meanwhile, Lavin said Dongallo “already sent a communication to the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) requesting for a certification on whether there had already been vaccines which has been registered or whether there are vaccines submitted for registration and on what stage already are these vaccines on the registration process.”
Also, the spokesperson said NBI investigators will also be reaching out to the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to determine “whether there had been importations or reported smuggling of vaccines.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The emergence in the United Kingdom (UK) of a variant of the COVID-19 virus has raised new fears aroundtheworld, butthe German firm BioNTech which developedthe Pfizer vaccine said it has “scientificconfidence” its drug will also work on the variant.
The proteins in the variant are99 percent thesame as those in the virus nowspreading around the world, Dr.Ugur Sahinwho developed the vaccine with his wife Dr. Ozlem Turecisaid.There is zero evidence that there is an increase in severityfromthe variant, he said.
He added his team would need aroundtwo weeks to test its vaccine on the new variantand “the likelihood that ourvaccine works is relatively high.” Should the vaccine need to be adjusted for the newvariant, the company could do so in about six weeks, Dr. Sahin said.This is the first reassuring statement about the new COVID-19 variant since it emerged recently in the UK, followed by South Africa.The reportsenta new wave of concern around the world. We are just beginning mass vaccinations against COVID-19 but already there isanew variant.
Our own President Duterte was quick to acton the report of theUK variant the day it was reported, he appoved a recommendation to ban all flights from the UK to the Philippines,and to subjectall travelers from countries reporting cases of the new strainto a mandatory 14-day quarantine.
Most of theworldis reeling today fromthe pandemic, withthe United Statespassing 20 million cases on New Year’s Day, amid reports of a very slow pace of vaccination.More than 3,900 people died in one dayalone – Wednesday, December 23 —and health workers fearthe worst is yet to comeas a result of theholiday gatherings.
President-elect Joseph Biden, who takes office on January 20,askedAmericans to wear facemasks to slow down the virus, but it seems this matter falls under the jurisdiction of state governments, not thefederal government. Outgoing President Donald Trump himself has given mixed messages on mask wearing and social distancingand has repeatedly downplayed the risks of COVID-19infection.TheCOVID-19 situation remains uncertain in most of the world but the fear over the new strainof the virus has been allayed by the team behind the Pfizer vaccine.

The Ayala Corporation would secure a supply of 450,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines from United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca as part of its commitment to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the people, business tycoon Fernando Zobel de Ayala said.
AC CEO Fernando Zobel de Ayala
Zobel, president and chief operator officer of Ayala Corp., said each dose of the AstraZeneca will cost around $5.50.
Ayala Corp. is among the several private companies that committed to secure AstraZeneca vaccine supply, wherein half will be donated to the government and the rest will be for their employees.“We’ve decided to order 450,000 vaccines of AstraZeneca so the total donation that we will be giving to government will be about P120 million,” Zobel said during an online Palace press briefing.
“Government in turn has requested that 50 percent be given for individuals that the government selects; and 50 percent will be given back to the private sector so that we can also provide the vaccine for the people who need it,” he said.
Zobel said the private sector has also committed to help with the distribution of the vaccines, which he claimed would be “a very important component in making sure that the vaccines can get to the public.”
“Whether it’s AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, Novavax, or Sinovax, they have their own peculiar requirements for distribution,” he said.Zobel said Ayala has so far spent P12.7 billion for various coronavirus response. He recognized that it was a time for both the government and private sector to work together to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, which he claimed has produced “so much suffering” in the country.
“The private sector has come through in a very big way with the call from the government and try to do everything that they could not only for their employees, their suppliers, but the public in general. I think we’re all here to help the country as a whole in the best way that we can,” he said.
“And so never in the history, at least in my career, have I seen so much work taking place between the private sector and the public sector,” he said.He said they appreciate the government’s recognition of the contributions of the private sector in dealing with the pandemic. “That’s greatly appreciated. And this will, of course, continue into next year,” he said.
“There’s a great spirit of collaboration among everyone to make sure that we get our country through this pandemic and through the many different challenges that we have been facing,” he added.
Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion had earlier said more than 200 local companies are interested to purchase another batch of COVID vaccines from the British vaccine maker.
The private sector had earlier signed a supply deal for 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines worth around P700 million. The supplies are expected to arrive this May or June. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Mandaluyong City has allocated P200 million for the purchase of the coronavirus vaccines, Mayor Carmelita Abalos said Monday, to augment the vaccination program of the national government in the city.
“Ang alam ko, ang inallot natin dito is P200 million for the vaccine (As far as I know, we have allotted P200 million for the vaccine),” Abalos said during the city’s weekly Monday morning activity.
According to the mayor, the national government will cover the vaccination for 60 percent of the city’s population, while the rest will be shouldered by the local government.“Kaya 200 million ang inilaan natin to cover up ‘yung 40 percent ng ating population para lahat mabakuhanan (So we have allocated P200 million to cover up the remaining 40 percent of our population so that everyone will be vaccinated),” she said.
Abalos said medical frontliners and indigent senior citizen residents will be prioritized in the vaccination.
The mayor said the vaccine is expected to be ready by March or April this year. Once approved for use, she said residents will receive two doses of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, Abalos has ordered barangay officials to submit the data needed by the local government for its vaccination program, including the number of residents who will receive the vaccine.

Opposition Sen. Francis “Kiko” N. Pangilinan supports the call of Vice President Leni Robredo for a transparent investigation of the alleged COVID-19 vaccine given to some members of the military and the Presidential Security Group.
Senator Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan (Photo from Kiko Pangilinan website / kikopangilinan.com / MANILA BULLETIN)“Bakit sinisikreto ang pagbabakuna? Dapat nga sine-celebrate ito dahil magandang balita ito, unless merong iligal sa mga transaksyon,” Pangilinan said.
(Why was the vaccination done secretly? This should be celebrated because this is good news, unless there was an illegal transaction)
“An honest and transparent investigation of the so-called smuggled vaccines and a credible result will bring back the confidence of the people in the government’s vaccination program. Dapat maparusahan ang gumagawa at nag-uutos ng iligal,” he added.
(Those who did this and those who ordered it must be punished)Pangilinan said the inoculation of the military and the President’s guards made a mockery of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has been working hard to find safe vaccines for the Filipinos against COVID-19.
It also endangers the military personnel inoculated since unauthorized vaccines still lack the safety and efficacy requirements, he said.Pangilinan said that the incident raised questions about who should get the vaccines first.“Palakasan ang nanaig sa kung sino ang mababakunahan. The vulnerable and poor sectors, the elderly and the frontliners as determined by the Department of Health, should be first in line,” he said.(It is very apparent that influence played a key role on who should be inoculated)
Pangilinan called on local government units not to emulate the unauthorized vaccination, stressing it was illegal and could imperil their constituents. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Aside from the P250-million vaccine fund allotted by the city, City Treasurer Anthony Pulmano said they are planning to borrow P1-billion as stand-by budget from the Land Bank of the Philippines. 
“If the need arises, we are planning to loan P1 billion additional fund from Landbank for the vaccination program of the city government which at the same time help the national government in shouldering the budget for vaccination of majority of Filipinos,” Pulmano said.

It would have been better if the government’s choice for the coronavirus vaccine has higher efficacy rate because it would build public trust and confidence in vaccines, Vice President Leni Robredo said.

Robredo cited the pending procurement of China-made Sinovac Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine, which has 50 percent efficacy rate.
It is expected to arrive by March, which would make it among the first vaccines to be administered to Filipinos.
“Ang pinaka-kampanya nga natin iyong confidence, ‘di ba, iyong tiwala sa bakuna. Kapag alam ng tao na ang baba ng efficiency o effectivity ng vaccine na ito, ‘di ba, mababa din iyong tiwala (Our major campaign is for confidence, trust in the vaccine. If the people know the efficiency or effectivity of the vaccine is low, the trust will also be less),” she said over dzXL.
The vice president noted some COVID-19 vaccines have high efficacy rate that will encourage people to be vaccinated against the infectious disease.
“Pero kapag alam niya na itong klaseng vaccine na ito, ganito iyong level ng effectivity, ito iyong mga nakuha noong mga kung sino, saang mga bansa, mas tataas iyong tiwala niya sa bakuna, mas maraming magpapabakuna (But if they know the kind of vaccine has this level of effectivity in other countries, their trust in vaccines will increase, many will be vaccinated),” she said.
The Department of Health (DOH) has assured that the 50 percent efficacy rate of Sinovac is within the World Health Organization’s (WHO) minimum requirement.
But in comparison with other vaccines from the United States, Pfizer and Moderna have an efficacy rate of 95 percent and 94.1 percent, respectively.
The vice president underscored the need for the government to explain to the public why it chose Sinovac, citing it is more expensive than the other COVID-19 vaccines with higher efficacy rates.
“Marahil totoo na iyong 50 percent acceptable na iyon, pero mahirap kasing ipaliwanag na mayroong iba in the market na mas mura, mas mataas nang di hamak iyong level of [efficacy]—iyong pipiliin natin na mas mahal, mas mababa (It’s true that 50 percent is acceptable, pero it will be difficult to explain other vaccines are cheaper with higher level of efficacy, but we will choose more expensive with a lower efficacy),” she said.

She said there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the issue of the “smuggled” vaccines.
“Unang una, papaano ba nakapasok ‘yung vaccine? Ang claim, donated. So ang tanong, sino nagdonate? Ang pangalawa, kahit dinonate mayroong requirements. At iyong requirement na iyan, kailangan ng FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approval,” she said on her Sunday radio show.(First of all, how did the vaccine enter the country? The claim it was donated so the question is who donated it…Second, even if it was donated there were requirements that needed the FDA approval)“Ang problema, mayroon tayong mga agencies na dapat dinaanan iyan. Iyong Customs (bureau) hindi nila alam. Iyong DOH (Department of Health) hindi niya alam. Iyong FDA sabi niya wala pa siyang binigay na kahit emergency (use) authorization. So kailangan itong sagutin,” she stressed.(We have many agencies where it should have passed through. The Customs and DOH don’t know it. The FDA said it has not issued an emergency use authorization. So these should be answered.)The Vice President said the people does not deserve this kind of controversy at a time when the administration should build public trust and focus on securing the COVID-19 vaccines for those in its priority list for inoculations.President Duterte revealed that China’s Sinopharm vaccines have been given to some people in government.The Sinopharm is not in the initial list of vaccines that the Philippines is eyeing, among which are Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Moderna, and another Chinese vaccine Sinovac.Robredo questioned the role of regulations in the country if the government itself will let people, especially public officials, to have access to unauthorized vaccines.
“If those close to the President were the ones who violated the existing protocols and the laws, this is not helpful. The rule whether it is donated or purchased, there are government agencies that need to approve it,” she said.Robredo added she agreed to the conduct of probe into the unauthorized distribution and administration of the COVID-19 vaccines for local use to hold those accountable.

Herrera said local authorities must guard against the possible spread of counterfeit vaccines in order to protect public health and safety.
“As we await the arrival of the much-awaited COVID-19 vaccines, ensuring that vaccines are authentic could emerge as an important issue,” the ranking lady solon said.Herrera noted that selling counterfeit vaccines is a crime. “We have to remember that counterfeit COVID-19 vaccines may pose serious health risks, and are ineffective at protecting an individual from the virus,” she added.She urged the Department of Health and the Food and Drug Administration to ensure the availability of affordable, safe, and effective vaccines for Filipinos.The House Deputy Speaker also called for proper distribution of COVID-19 vaccines once they become available in the country.“Proper distribution means we have to follow the guidelines on which area and sectors that will be given COVID-19 shots first,” she said.The government had earlier announced that nearly 25 million Filipinos composed of frontline health workers, senior citizens, the poor, and uniformed personnel will be among the first to receive the vaccine.Areas with the highest number of COVID-19 cases will be prioritized for the mass immunization program that is expected to happen within the first half of 2021.

The Senate Committee of the Whole is preparing for its initial public hearing on January 11 on the reported delays in the purchase and in the preparation for distribution of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines.
Senate President Vicente C. Sotto III said committee staffers are now busy preparing a list of invitations to resource speakers who would come from the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), Department of Health (DOH) and those involved in the vaccination program.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III (Joseph Vidal/Senate PRIB/ MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
Sotto said a list of resource speakers sought to be invited to the public inquiry sent by opposition Senator Francis ‘’Kiko’ N. Pangilinan was ‘’masyadong madami’’ (it is too long).The convening of the Senate as a Committee of the Whole was sponsored by Pangilinan.
Sotto said he advised Pangillnan’s staff to reduce the list of the two dozen resource persons to be invited to the Senate to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine issue.He saidall the 24 speakers could not possibly be asked to discuss the issues.
This difficulty arises when each of the 23 senators, who will be physically or virtually present, would be given 10 minutes each to field their questions.
Sotto said the public hearing would be restricted to bare essentials as the committee would conduct another hearing.“Matagal pa naman yan dahil nadelay nga ang pagkakabili natin, pagdating dito sa atin ichecheck pa ng FDA yan. We have plenty of time to go about it. Ilan uunahin, paano procedure, saan itatago. kasama sa 72.5-B na nilagay sa budget kasama rin kung saan itatago o itatabi (The hearing might take long as the purchase of vaccines has been delayed. Upon their arrival, the vaccines would be checked by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Will we determine who or what to take up first, what is the procedure, where to store them…Is the P72.5 billion in the budget withinreach),” he said.
The Senate Chief said the proposal of Minority Leader Franklin M. Drilon to call the commander of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) to the hearing could be taken up in later hearings as the controversial ‘’illegal, unauthorized’’ vaccination of some PSG members was not taken up during a Senate privilege speech.
On complaints that the FDA takes too long to make recommendations on drugs it has inspected, Sotto replied: ‘’Napakatagal ng panahong tama ka. Napakatagal na, napakabagal, napakaraming ganun. Siguro meron naman magiisip na maiimbestiga tungkol dyan, ang daming reklamo, ang tagal daw.’’ Ilan ang nakapending sa FDA na mga gamot. (You are right, FDA takes too long, it is too slow. There are many similar instances. Maybe there are those who want the FDA investigated. There are many complaints. It is very slow. There are many drugs pending at FDA),” he said.‘’Yun ang imbestigahan ng DOJ (Department of Justice) bakit ang PSG ang iimbestigahan? ano ang nasa batas. Ano ang nasa batas wala, wala namang nakalagay sa batas na kapag uminom ka ng gamot na di registered sa FDA may kasalanan ka, wala. Walang batas against suicide kaya ano ang iimbestigahan ng DOJ, yung mga doktor na nagsaksak, eh paano kung di doktor, kung sila sila? (That is what the DOJ should investigate. Why probe the PSG? It is not in the law. There is nothing in the law that states that you are to be held liable if you drink a drug that is not FDA-registered. No violation. There is no law against those who commit suicide. The DOJ should investigate the doctor who made the injection. If there is no doctor, who are they),’’ he asked.
On Malacanang’s travel ban due to the emergence of a COVID-19 variant, Sotto said: ‘’Tama lang yun. Di pwedeng sabihing mabilis o mabagal dahil ginawa agad, ganun dapat ginawa noong Enero’’ (That is correct. It is correct to impose the ban. That should have been done in January the first time the COVID-19 started in Wuhan, China) SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) assured Saturday that no government officials will be spared from its investigation into the illegal importation and use of vaccines against COVID-19.
NBI Deputy Director Ferdinand Lavin made the assurance during a radio interview over DZBB following a verbal order from Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra to conduct the probe.
“We’ll look at maraming possible violations from the Medical Practice Act to the tariff on the Customs Code of the Philippines, paano ito nakapasok (We’ll look at the many possible violations from the Medical Practice Act to the Customs Code),” he said.Lavin added there could also be violations with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), rules of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), and the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
“Hindi lang naman government officials and employees (Not only government officials and employees will be made accountable) but also private individuals who may have cooperated with the government employees or officials,” the NBI spokesperson said.
Guevarra gave the directive for the NBI to conduct the investigation following the admission of Presidential Security Group (PSG) commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III that the PSG was able to get COVID-19 vaccines and have its personnel vaccinated to better protect President Duterte from getting infected with COVID-19.
If the importation and use of the vaccine is a government-to-government deal, Lavin said the NBI if there have been lapses made.“Kung merong lapses (if there are lapses), we will look into that,” he said.
Lavin assured that the investigation that will be conducted will not be centered on the PSG alone.
“Hindi lang naka-focus doon o nakatuon doon. Kailangan tingnan din ‘yung iba (It can’t be just focused on that. Investigations will have to be done on other areas as well),” he said.So far, the NBI spokesperson admitted that the only person of interest identified by the NBI is Durante regarding the issue of importation and use of the COVID-19 vaccines.
“Mag-umpisa tayo dito kay Gen. Durante at kung anong detalye ang ibibigay niya (We will start with Gen. Durante and what information he will give),” the NBI official said.
“And, simultaneous to that, we will reach out to FDA, Bureau of Customs,” he added.
Because of this, Lavin urged Durante to fully cooperate with the NBI in conducting the probe.
“The NBI would appreciate it very much if he can reduce it into writing under oath,” said Lavin who urged Durante to give as much details as he could.In the meantime, Lavin said the NBI is awaiting the official order that Guevarra will issue before proceeding with the investigation.
“There are already agents on standby and within the next few days the director will be issuing the special order for this as soon as we receive the department order,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Royal Cargo, Inc., the country’s leading integrated logistics provider, is expanding its pharmaceutical logistics services with the construction of new temperate controlled facility to ensure proper handling and storage of the critical COVID-19 vaccines into the country. Royal Cargo President Elmer Sarmiento told Business Bulletin they are investing at least P50 million for the construction of four new buildings at its Paranaque headquarters.Construction of the new facility is ongoing and is expected to be completed in February this year, just in time for the first quarter expected arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine into the country.
“We are investing in a facility with low temperature unit for Pfizer vaccines but we have been in the business of pharma logistics long before so we are taking this opportunity of investing around P50 million. We are just adding four more because it is also expensive,” he said. According to Sarmiento, the temperate controlled facility would ensure they would meet the three types of storage requirements. These are the Plus 2-8 degrees Celsius, minus 20, and minus 70 degrees. Certain pharmaceutical firms that produce the COVID-19 vaccines require minus 70-degree storage facilities. Its expansion will be located inside its half a hectare main office in Paranaque, which is also ideal because it is just a kilometer away from the airport. This will serve as its pharma logistics hub as Royal Cargo is also engaged in providing storage and logistics for clinical trials and some other vaccines, and other high value medicines.“We have been into this business for quite some time, but with the COVID-19, we are growing this part of our business,” said Sarmiento, who said that pharma logistics is still a small portion of its total business. Earlier, Royal Cargo successfully cleared and delivered over one million vials of Penticiline vaccine within the required temperature of +2˚C to +8˚C without breaking the cold chain.
The said vaccines were delivered for the Department ofHealth thru Medical Vaccine Online Deliveries which aims to address the common diseases for infants including Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hepatitis B and H, and Influenza type B.Royal Cargo’s Pharmaceutical Logistics unit provides logistics management solutions for pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries.
Aside from the Paranaque headquarters, Royal Cargo has big facilities in Bulacan, Cavite and Laguna.
Amb. Benedicto V. Yujuico, President of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI), the largest umbrella of business organizations in the country cited reports that the vaccines now in advance stages of development require meticulous handling and sub-zero cold chain infrastructure, which the country does not currently have.
“There are no facilities in the country that can handle -80°C. The lowest temperature our cold storage facilities can go down to is -20°C to 25°C. The same is true for refrigerated trucks,” Yujuico said.
Cold storage facilities and refrigerated trucks in the country meanwhile also handle mixed cargo – fish, meat, dairy, fruit and vegetables. There is the danger of contamination of the vaccines if co-stored in these facilities.“We need dedicated transport service and storage spaces to keep the integrity of the vaccines. These require massive investment and coordination, a herculean task that cannot be done by government alone,” Yujuico said.
Expressing appreciation at the efforts of government to bring a vaccine to the country, Yujuico said PCCI is already consulting with industry players in the cold chain and supply chain businesses, transport (airfreight, shipping and trucking), and power generation, and is doing an inventory of existing facilities to step up the readiness of cold storage infrastructure and delivery logistics for the vaccine. PCCI is also consulting with its local chambers for possible vaccination centers where these facilities may be put up.
PCCI said government’s partnership will entice private sector investment in the cold chain delivery system. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has vowed to investigate members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) for acquiring and using vaccines against the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
AFP spokesman Marin Maj. Gen Edgar Arevalo said in a statement that AFP chief-of-staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay has already “ordered the conduct of a thorough investigation on the factual circumstances surrounding this incident.”
The move was made after PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III earlier bared that the PSG was able to get COVID-19 vaccines and have its personnel vaccinated.On the other hand, Arevalo reiterated that AFP believes that the move made by the PSG was necessary to prevent President Duterte from catching COVID-19.
“We stand by the previous statement of PSG Commander BGen Jesus Durante that the President’s close-in security had themselves inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine to greatly reduce the possibility of being the source and carrier of this virus and consequently infect the President, whose good health and well-being are the PSG’s primordial concern,” Arevalo said.
“However, we maintain our previous declaration that the Chief-of-Staff of the AFP was not part of or privy about the circumstances involving the procurement of these vaccines, its source, and the administration thereof to PSG troopers,” he assured.
Under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 3720 or the amended Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, it is provided that any new drug “should have an authorization from the FDA based on an application containing full reports of investigations.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Manila City government ushered in the New Year by launching a website where residents can pre-register to avail of the free coronavirus vaccine once it arrives and approved for use.
In his message posted on the welcome page of the website, Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso urged Manila residents to pre-register to make the process to get free COVID-19 vaccines faster for everyone once it is available.

“Hinihikayat ko po kayo na lumahok sa pre-registration process na ating nilunsad ngayon upang mas mapabilis at mainam na proseso ng FreeCOVID-19 Vaccine para sa lahat sa sandaling dumating ito (I encourage you to participate in the pre-registration process we launched today to make the Free COVID-19 Vaccine process faster and better for everyone once it arrives),” Mayor Isko said.“Pumanatag kayo na tanging sertipikado lang ng Food and Drug Administration ang bibilin nating bakuna upang matiyak ito na epektibo at ligtas gamitin (Rest assured that we will only buy vaccines certified by the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that they are effective and safe to use),” he added.
Manila residents willing to avail of the vaccine can pre-register through http://manilacovid19vaccine.com.
The city government has set aside about P250 million for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.
The mayor underscored the importance of being inoculated saying this is an effective way to avoid getting infected by the coronavirus.“Kasabay sa pagbabakuna, ang mga mahahalagang hakbang gaya ng tamang paghuhugas ng kamay, pagsusuot ng face mask at pag iwas sa pakikisalamuha sa maraming tao ay dapat pa rin sundin (Along with vaccination, we should still continue observing proper hand washing, wearing of face mask and avoid large gathering),” the mayor added.
In a Twitter post on Thursday night, Domagoso said the city government has reached out to US-based drug manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna for the COVID-19 vaccines they are currently testing.
“While it is true that we will prioritize medical frontliners and senior citizens based on the policies of the World Health Organization, DOH (Department of Health) and IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force)… after we vaccinate the said sector, we will immediately start the vaccination for those who are interested to have peace of mind in their daily lives,” he said.The vaccine will be administered in two doses in an interval of four weeks. It reportedly takes a few weeks for the body to establish immunity or protection from diseases after vaccination.
Domagoso explained that if a person has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19 before or after they get vaccinated, there is still a chance that they could still get COVID-19.
“Ito ay dahil sa ang bakuna ay hindi nagkaroon ng sapat na oras para makabuo ng proteksyon (This is because the vaccine did not have enough time to ensure protection),” he said.“May pagkakataon pa rin na kahit nabakunahan na ay nagkakasakit pa rin ngunit hindi ito malala (There is still a chance that even after being inoculated you will still get sick but it is not serious,” Mayor Isko added.
Although there might be some who might get fever or feel weak after being vaccinated, Domagoso noted that these symptoms are normal and are signs that the body is developing protection.“Lahat ng magpapabakuna laban sa COVID-19 ay magdadaan sa masusing pagsusuri (All those who will get the vaccine shots will undergo a thorough examination),” Domagoso assured.

Citing that the economic losses to every day under the “new normal” amount to at least P85 billion, House Ways and Means panel Chair Albay 2nd District Rep. Joey Sarte Salceda has proposed that President Duterte be given much leeway or specific powers to implement the COVID-19 response and recovery interventions, and expedite the vaccine procurement, importation, and rollout.
(Cong. Joey Salceda’s office / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Under his House Bill No. 8285 or the proposed “Bayanihan sa Bakuna Act”, the House leader wanted to eliminate all the roadblocks to vaccine procurement, distribution, and administration to ensure the immediate importation and rollout of the coronavirus vaccines.
“I have authored Bayanihan sa Bakuna Act to cut all the red tape and eliminate any further delay in getting the public vaccinated. The vaccines are available. We have the money. We know the costs of delaying the vaccine. So, we must not tolerate any further delay in getting our people vaccinated,” Salceda said in a statement.“All channels – political, diplomatic, commercial – should be used to procure and roll them out expeditiously and without undue delay,” he stressed.
In his bill’s explanatory note, Salceda said the costs of each day of not having the vaccine are staggering.
According to the co-chairperson of the Economic Cluster of the Defeat COVID-19 Ad hoc panel, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) estimates that every week of enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) or modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) in the National Capital Region (NCR) and its adjacent regions alone shaves off 0.28 percentage points from the gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
“This is equivalent to around 2.1 billion pesos in lost wages a day. The amount during GCQ is lower at around 700 million pesos a day, but is nonetheless a major blow to household incomes, particularly during this period of economic hardship, where involuntary hunger has reached unmatched heights in the country’s recent history,” Salceda said.He said the country can no longer absorb the economic losses of any further restriction in economic activity.
“This has to end. And there is no better way to end this pandemic than with the quick rollout of the vaccine,” Salceda said.
He said under his measure, the President is authorized to exercise the following powers to expedite the procurement and administration of the COVID_19 vaccine and related supplies:-Exempt vaccine procurement from circuitous procurement laws;
-Set forth a mandatory vaccination program for health care workers;
-Assume health care workers’ medical bills due to COVID-19, including side effects of the vaccine;
-Engage the Philippine Red Cross in rolling out the vaccine;
-Liberalize the grant of tax incentives for importation of the COVID-19 vaccine;
-Create savings from unutilized appropriations, and directs them towards vaccine procurement;
-Allocate funds held by GOCCs and national government agencies towards COVID-19 procurement;
-Accelerate private sector requests for authorization to import COVID-19 vaccines; and
-Facilitate LGU requests to import COVID-19 vaccines, provided that these requests do not compete with the government’s efforts to procure such vaccines.
Salceda said his measure also seeks to waive the Phase IV requirement for vaccine approval, under certain conditions.
It also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve vaccines that have already been tested on Filipinos abroad, he said.
“Thousands of nurses in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the Middle East, are Filipinos. Actually, given that many of these areas manufactured vaccines, our nurses were first in the line for the vaccine there. So, there is no reason to disapprove vaccines that were proven effective for our fellow Filipinos, since the allergy profile should be the same,” he said.
Under the bill, the FDA and other relevant agencies are mandated “to expedite authorizations for vaccines for which trials have been conducted successfully on Filipinos without serious adverse effects, as certified by counterparts in other countries.”The measure also empowers the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) to explore diplomatic channels to accelerate vaccine procurement.
The bill also seeks to identify the sources of funding for vaccine procurement, even as it calls for the creation of a congressional oversight committee to ensure that the Executive faithfully and expeditiously implements the proposed Act.
“The vaccines are available. Let’s waste no time, especially when lives, jobs, and our economic future are on the line,” Salceda said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Philippine Ambassador to Bahrain Alfonso Ver has received the coronavirus vaccine as part of the free immunization drive in the small Middle East state.
In an online press conference in Bahrain, Ver admitted getting inoculated against coronavirus after simply registering online to avail of the vaccine offered by government there. He is reportedly the first Filipino envoy to get the vaccine shot abroad.(Photo from Philippine Ambassador to Bahrain Alfonso Ver/ MANILA BULLETIN)
“I’ve been tested here six times. You just call a number and you get tested. Even vaccination, na-vaccinate na rin po ako (I have been vaccinated),” the Filipino diplomat said during the briefing organized by the Presidential Communications Operations Office-Office of Global Media Affairs.
“I just registered in an online app. There’s even a choice kung ano gusto mong vaccine. In two minutes, tapos (There’s even a choice which vaccine you like. In two minutes, it’s complete),” he said.
Early this month, Bahrain announced plans to provide COVID-19 vaccines for free to all citizens and residents to protect public health and safety.
Bahrain recently became the second country in the world to grant emergency use of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by US giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. The United Kingdom earlier approved the vaccine for general use.
Bahrain earlier allowed the emergency use for the vaccine made by Sinopharm.Ver noted that the Bahrain government has offered health benefits such as free testing and vaccination in line with its effort to fight the spread of the coronavirus.
“We are indeed very fortunate here. The government (is) providing these benefits and the Filipinos, they can take advantage of several avenues, official or on their own helping themselves,” he said.
Ver also expressed gratitude to Bahrain for its labor reforms, such as flexible work permit program, to promote the welfare of migrant workers, including Filipinos. Around 50,000 Filipinos are living and working in Bahrain.

A coronavirus vaccine developed by drug firm AstraZeneca and Oxford University has been approved for use in Britain, the government said Wednesday, adding the mass rollout will start on January 4.

The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions, and is therefore cheaper and easier to administer than the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs that require freezing.
Britain will become the first nation to roll out the jab on January 4, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said, amid mounting concerns that another dangerous spike in infections threatens to overwhelm the NHS.“Brilliant to end 2020 with such a moment of hope,” tweeted Hancock.
“The #coronavirus vaccine is our way out of the pandemic — now we need to hold our nerve while we get through this together.”
The government said in a statement earlier that it had “today accepted the recommendation from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to authorise Oxford University/AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine for use.
“This follows rigorous clinical trials and a thorough analysis of the data by experts at the MHRA, which has concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness,” said the Department of Health and Social Care spokesman.On Sunday, AstraZeneca’s Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said the vaccine provides “100 percent protection” against severe Covid disease requiring hospitalisation.
He predicted trials would show his firm had achieved a vaccine efficacy equal to Pfizer-BioNTech at 95 percent and Moderna at 94.5 percent.
Earlier trials had shown varying outcomes in the AstraZeneca shot’s efficacy.The vaccine intially showed an average 70 percent effectiveness but that level jumped to 90 percent depending on the dosage regime.
Behind this average figure from large-scale trials in the UK and Brazil was a 62 percent effectiveness for those who were vaccinated with two full doses of the shot.
For volunteers who received a half-dose first and then a full dose one month later, however, the vaccine was found to have 90 percent efficacy. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque is planning to get his doctor’s advice before deciding to get inoculated with coronavirus vaccines.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque (OPS / MANILA BULLETIN)
Amid reports of the vaccination of some government officials and military personnel, Roque has preferred to get medical advice given his health condition.
“I will wait po for my doctor’s advice because I have diabetes and I have a heart condition,” he said during a televised briefing Tuesday when asked if he has received a vaccine shot.Roque earlier defended the vaccination of the President’s close-in security team, saying no government funds were spent for the medicines. He claimed the vaccines were donated, without giving details about the identity of the donor.
“It was not paid for. So it is a donation, but that’s all that I know,” he said.
Roque also considered the COVID vaccines given to the PSG as mere tokens with small value, adding no violation of the anti-graft law was committed.
PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III earlier confirmed that several PSG members providing close-in security to the President received doses of the COVID vaccine. The vaccination, which started last September, was an independent move by the PSG in line with its mission to protect the President from the illness, according to Durante.Durante said the vaccination was a “courageous step” of taking the vaccines to ensure they are not threat to the President’s health and safety. He noted that they did not ask permission from the President and informed him after the vaccination of the PSG personnel.

The Parañaque City government will allocate P250 million for its vaccination program for coronavirus (COVID-19).
According to Mayor Edwin Olivarez, the city government will prioritize the frontliners, senior citizens, and the vulnerable sector.
Olivarez said the P200 million will be sourced from the 2021 general fund while the remaining P50 million will come from the budget of the local school board.Olivarez, who is also the chairman of the Metro Manila Council, said most mayors had also earmarked funds for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine next year.
“We are only waiting for guidelines from the DOH (Department of Health) and FDA (Food and Drug Administration) so we can purchase directly to the authorized pharmaceutical companies,” Olivarez said.
The city has logged 8,049 coronavirus cases of which 206 have died based on the report of the City Health Office.
A total of 7,742 patients have recovered from the disease while 101 are still sick with the virus.Amid the threat of a coronavirus variant that emerged in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Europe and now spreading to other countries, which experts said is more contagious, Olivarez already came out with a memorandum order and told village chiefs to be vigilant.
“I ordered our village chiefs to strictly monitor all ‘balikbayans’ in their area of jurisdiction specifically those coming from UK, Europe, or South Africa and if they have any findings, I told them to immediately coordinate with the City Health Office for proper and appropriate health intervention and management,” Olivarez said.

The country’s anti-graft law has not been violated when the Presidential Security Group (PSG) accepted donated coronavirus vaccines since the items could be considered as “tokens” with small value, according to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque (OPS / MANILA BULLETIN)
In a televised press briefing, Roque explained that the law prohibiting public officials and workers not to solicit or accept gift or anything of monetary value was “not absolute.”
“Ako po ay abogado. Hindi po ‘yan absolute. ‘Yung mga tokens pinapayagan naman lalo na kung panahon ng Pasko. Puwede pong tokens, ‘yung mga wala masyadong halaga ibig sabihin (I am a lawyer. That is not absolute. The tokens are allowed especially during Christmas. Tokens or those with small value are allowed),” Roque said during a televised press briefing.Roque was reacting to queries if there was any breach of the anti-graft law in accepting COVID-19 vaccines donated to the President’s security team.
Asked if the vaccines are considered tokens, Roque said: “I don’t think it’s of much value anyway.”He found nothing wrong with accepting small tokens especially during special occasions.
“So ‘yung mga little value sa mga special occasion. I’m not arguing. So ‘yun lang nakasaad sa batas but it is not an absolute ban (So those with little value during special occasions. I’m not arguing. That’s what the law says but it is not an absolute ban),” he said.“Kung ganyan, ‘yung aking birthday cake na natanggap sa mga tauhan, that constitutes graft and corruption. Hindi naman po. ‘Yun mga of little value (If that’s the case, the birthday cake I received from my staff would constitute graft and corruption. It’s not. As long as they have little value),” he said.
Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act prohibits public officers from “directly or indirectly requesting or receiving any gift, present, share, percentage, or benefit, for himself or for any other person, in connection with any contract or transaction between the government and any other party.”It also declares unlawful the “directly or indirectly requesting or receiving any gift, present or other pecuniary or material benefit, for himself or for another, from any person for whom the public officer, in any manner or capacity, has secured or obtained, or will secure or obtain, any Government permit or license, in consideration for the help given or to be given.”The same law however excludes “unsolicited gifts or presents of small or insignificant value offered or given as a mere ordinary token of gratitude or friendship according to local customs or usage.”
PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III earlier confirmed that PSG personnel providing close-in security to the President have been inoculated with the COVID vaccine in line with its mission to protect the country’s leader. Durante however declined to provide details about how the unregistered vaccines were obtained by the PSG.
To date, the country’s Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any coronavirus vaccine in the country. The Palace earlier said it was not against the law for someone to receive a vaccine as long as it was not commercially imported, distributed and sold in large amounts.
In his briefing Tuesday, Roque made clear that no government funds were used to purchase the vaccines given to the PSG troopers. “It was not paid for so it’s a donation, but that’s all that I know,” he said.
“Huwag natin masamaın ‘yan dahil yan ang magreresulta sa mabuting kalusugan ng ating Presidente and let’s close the issue at that (Let’s not take it the wrong way because that will result to the President’s good health and let’s close the issue at that),” he said.

PNP chief Gen. Debold Sinas said he and some police officers will meet again with FDA officials to come up with operational plan against the spread of both the fake vaccines and real vaccines that are being sold in the black market.
“We are worried that these so-called vaccines could be fake. So we are talking with the FDA so that we could finalize the plan against this,” said Sinas.On Sunday, President Duterte disclosed that several soldiers have already been inoculated with the COVID-19 vaccine. The military initially denied having information about it but later admitted that those who were given vaccines are members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG).
The President’s revelation sparked outrage in the social media where netizens pointed out favoritism and illegal vaccination since no vaccine on COVID-19 has so far been approved by the FDA for use in the country.
There were also reports in the past that vaccines, especially coming from China, were already being sold illegally in the country. The PNP leadership earlier tapped the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group to monitor the report.
Sinas also included the Anti-Cybercrime Group in running after fake vaccines and COVID vaccines being sold in the black market as these could also being offered online.“We are already monitoring it but we have been in constant coordination with the FDA on this,” said Sinas.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday said that it already approved the application of Belgium-based Janssen Pharmaceutical to hold Phase III clinical trials in the Philippines for its COVID-19 candidate vaccine.FDA Director General Rolando Enrique Domingo said that Jannsen passed the evaluation of the country’s health regulators. This will be the first independent trial that will be conducted in the Philippines.“We approved one. This is Janssen’s clinical trial. This has been given the go signal by FDA and they will start the clinical trial maybe after (the start of the) new year,” said Domingo during a press briefing.
Domingo said that they are currently reviewing the application of two pharmaceutical companies from China: the Sinovac Biotech and Clover Pharmaceuticals. Both Chinese firms already passed the evaluation of the vaccine experts panel of the Department of Science and Technology and the Single Joint Review Ethics Board.They just need to secure the nod from the FDA before they could begin the clinical trials of their respective COVID-19 candidate vaccine in the Philippines. Meanwhile, Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Solidarity Trials for Vaccines may also start next month.“They have committed to us that maybe by the third week of January we can already start. In preparation and based also with the agreements with them when we had our meeting, we are now preparing the sites for the WHO Solidarity Trials for Vaccines,” she said.
Furthermore, Domingo said that as of now,the only pharmaceutical company that has submitted its application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine in the country was American-drugmaker Pfizer.“It was submitted to us on December 23.

Senator Franklin Drilon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
At the same time, Drilon questioned how the China-made vaccines were able to get past the Bureau of Customs (BoC).
“As government officials, our priority is the safety of our people. That is the very purpose of FDA authorization—to make sure that the vaccines that we administer to our people are safe, effective and of certain quality,” Drilon said in a statement.
“We, the leaders, should only obtain, approve and administer vaccines to our people, which we ourselves, will use,” the senator added.
The minority leader further said that the reported inoculation of some Cabinet officials and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) “sets a bad example” and undermines the very purpose of the creation of the FDA. It is also a clear violation of FDA Circular No. 2020-036 or the “Guidelines on the Issuance of Emergency Use Authorization for Drugs and Vaccines for COVID-19.”
The FDA, he said, exists to ensure the “purity, safety, efficacy and quality of drugs and vaccines in the country.”
“What was done completely dismissed the well-entrenched public safety and health protocols. It further undermined the regulatory authority of the FDA with regard to the inspection, licensing and monitoring of establishments and the registration and monitoring of health products,” Drilon stressed.
Under the FDA Law or Republic Act No. 3720, as amended by RA No. 9711, Drilon said the law prohibits the “manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, non-consumer use, promotion, advertising or sponsorship of any health product that is adulterated, unregistered or misbranded or any health product which, although requiring registration, is not registered with the FDA pursuant to this Act.”
Section 21 of the same law, he said, also provides that no person shall manufacture, sell, offer for sale or transfer any new drug unless there is a full report of investigations showing the drug is safe, efficacious and of good quality based on clinical studies prior to manufacture, sale and importation and distribution.
He also said the FDA Circular applies both to pharmaceutical industries and government entities such as national procurer or health program implementers requires the issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which must be filed and obtained from the FDA.
The EUA is an authorization for unregistered drugs and vaccines in a public health emergency, which can be obtained upon demonstration of safety, effectiveness and quality.
“In this case, no Emergency Use Authorization was ever issued prior to the inoculation of the above-mentioned officials,” Drilon lamented.
Under the FDA Law, any person who violates any of the provision of Section 11 of RA 3720, as amended, faces a penalty of imprisonment ranging from 1 to 10 years or a fine of not less P50-thousand but not more than half a million or both.
Manufacturers, importers or distributors face stiffer penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment and a fine of P500 thousand to P5-million.
However, Drilon said the Filipinos could only hope that what transpired will not influence the FDA’s decision-making process in issuing an EUA to unregistered vaccines, including the China-made vaccines.
The FDA, he said, can also issue cease and desist orders motu propio or upon verified complaint for health products, whether or not registered with the FDA.
“I hope this does not give us a glimpse of how they intend to implement the biggest vaccine drive in Philippine history. Otherwise, we are doomed,” Drilon said.
“I hope that when the government’s COVID-19 vaccination starts—with FDA-authorized vaccines—front-line healthcare workers and the poor should be given priority. Let the front-line doctors and nurses get the first and limited shots. No one should cut in line,” he stressed. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Durante confirmed that PSG troopers providing close-in security to the President have been given vaccine shots against the new coronavirus disease.He explained the vaccination drive was done “not for personal agenda” but in line with the group’s mission to protect the President.“PSG is the primary unit of the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) that is mandated to protect the nation’s highest leader. With the current pandemic, PSG needs to ensure that they are not themselves threat to the President’s health and safety. As such the PSG administered COVID-19 vaccine to its personnel performing close-in security operations to the President,” Durante said in a statement.
“COVID-19 is a first in history, and the whole world is hopeful in developing and obtaining the perfect vaccine. PSG’s decision to take the risk is a courageous step that greatly supports its mandate. We did it not for personal agenda but on a greater pursuit that is even way beyond our mission of protecting our President,” he added.
Durante also said the PSG’s main task is to ensure the country has “a healthy President serving our fellow Filipinos every day.” “National security imposes the protection of the President being the Commander in-Chief from all forms of threat, especially COVID-19, in order to preserve the stability of our nation,” he said.
In getting the COVID vaccines for its personnel,Durante said the PSG has exhausted means to carry out its mission of protecting the President. “We are in a state of war, a war against COVID 19. War compels us to survive as what we are now doing in this pandemic. As such, PSG exploits all means in order to deliver its mandate as what is highly expected of them by the Filipino people,’ he said.
The Armed Forces earlier admitted that the PSG troopers were the first from its ranks to receive COVID vaccines as part of its mission. The same revelation was reportedly made by Interior and Local Government Secretary Eduardo Año Monday.President Duterte, in a televised address over the weekend, revealed that some soldiers were inoculated with coronavirus vaccines to ensure their health amid the pandemic.In a later interview over DZRH, Durante said the COVID vaccination of the PSG personnel started around two months ago. He said it was an “independent move” by the PSG, adding he no longer asked permission from the President on the matter.
So far, Durante said they have not seen any adverse effect of the vaccines on the PSG troopers. No one also tested positive for coronavirus so far, he added.Durante however declined to identify the vaccine given to the PSG personnel.“I take responsibility for that action.

Following reports that some soldiers have received vaccines against the viral disease, FDA called on the public anew on taking extreme caution on the purchase and use of vaccines claiming to be safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.Director General Eric Domingo stressed that “as of date the FDA has not issued any Emergency Use Authorization to any vaccine for COVID-19.”“Without the proper authorization, there is no guarantee on the safety, quality and efficacy of said vaccine as the same has not undergone the required technical evaluation by the FDA,” Domingo said.The FDA warned that the manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, non-consumer use, promotion, advertisement, or sponsorship of any unauthorized vaccine is prohibited.“Commission of such prohibited acts may lead to possible liabilities provided under the law,” Domingo said.The director general also said they will coordinate with other agencies and take appropriate regulatory action involving any unauthorized vaccines.The Department of Health, on the other hand, maintained that all vaccines should undergo the evaluation and regulatory process of regulatory and expert bodies.“We also reiterate that the use of unregistered products poses harm to a person’s health and safety. This is why only vaccines which have been approved and found to be safe should be administered,” the Health department said in a statement.It added that the administration of approved vaccines is also accompanied by strict monitoring of all vaccine recipients in order to ensure proper management of possible effects.“Rest assured that the FDA is observing utmost diligence in the regulation of vaccines. Vaccines will only be approved if there is reasonable scientific evidence to show that benefit outweighs risk.” Domingo said.“We will concentrate on making sure that only vaccines that pass standards will be made available to the public,” he added.

Drilon said Monday that this could particularly affect the confidence of people, which he said is important for the success of the government’s COVID-19 inoculation plan.
“Public confidence is critical to the successful inoculation of our people. Confidence is developed by adhering to a science-based process and the opinion of our vaccine expert panel,” he said in a brief statement sent to reporters.“The inoculation using vaccines not approved by our FDA will not contribute to need to develop public confidence that the government program will succeed,” he added.
Duterte earlier confessed that several people in government, including members of the Philippine military, have already received vaccines from Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could approve its use.
The President wanted the military and police to be vaccinated against COVID-19 first.
For Senate President Vicente Sotto III, no laws have been violated when the unapproved vaccines were given to the state workers, even for those who administered it.
“You will have to prosecute all those who administer herbal med[icine]s and other types of meds not FDA approved. But then again, what law did they violate? I cannot think of one,” Sotto said.
He opined that FDA’s approval is needed only if the government will be the one procuring and administering the vaccines. He was confident that government funds were not used in the premature inoculation of the soldiers, saying the vaccines could be donated.
Health officials have repeatedly warned the public against the use of unregistered and unapproved vaccines. Selling of unregistered vaccines is prohibited, the FDA said earlier in one of its advisories.The FDA said that as of Monday, it has yet to issue any Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for any vaccine against COVID-19.

There is nothing wrong if government officials have already been immunized against COVID-19 even before local regulators have authorized the use of a vaccine in the country, Senate President Vicente Sotto III said on Monday.

Sotto said he sees no issue with President Duterte’s admission that several people in government, particularly soldiers, were given doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm ahead of the approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“I don’t think there’s anything wrong about that. There is no law that says you cannot take any medicine or vaccine that FDA has not approved,” Sotto said in a message to reporters.He also pointed out that there is no law prohibiting people from putting themselves at risk or committing suicide.
“Last I recall, there is even no law vs. suicide. So what’s the fuss?” he said.
Besides, he is “sure” that the vaccines used were given for free.
“‘Yong mga pumapalag, pwede ‘yong reklamo nila kung gobyerno nagbayad. Eh kung donation? Umangal sila sa donor bakit ‘yon gusto nila inuna! (Those who are reacting against it can complain if the government paid for it. What if this was a donation? Complain before the donor why they chose those people to go first!),” he said.Duterte on Saturday said that he will not lie about the fact that almost all Philippine soldiers have already been injected with the vaccine from Sinopharm. This was confirmed on Monday by Philippine Army chief Cirilito Sobejana, although saying for his part that only “some” members of the military were inoculated against the disease.
Department of Interior and Local Government Secretary Eduardo Año also said he knew that “some from the Cabinet and from the Presidential Security Group” have also been vaccinated.
Soldiers and policemen are among the government’s priority for its upcoming COVID-19 vaccination program, as Duterte had repeatedly committed in in his pronouncements.Despite this, government officials also promised to prioritize health workers and members of the poor and vulnerable societies, as well as other essential workers in government.
Earlier, Sotto bared that Senator Panfilo Lacson and House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez were already vaccinated against COVID-19. Lacson, however, refused to categorically confirm or deny whether he was indeed immunized, hinting that it could be just a joke within them.
The Senate Committee of the Whole is set to discuss in January the government’s COVID-19 vaccination program. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In a press briefing, Sinas said he is not aware that any member of the PNP has been given a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine like what was enjoyed by some soldiers which President Duterte disclosed in his latest meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF-MEID).
Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commanding general of the Philippine Army, confirmed Monday that there several soldiers have already received the vaccine.Sinas said he is not aware of any instruction to have some policemen vaccinated.
“I have no information of any policemen who was vaccinated, we are still waiting for any guidance relating to this,” said Sinas.
What he is aware of, according to Sinas, is that policemen would be prioritized in the vaccination since they would be the ones who would escort and provide security in the conduct of mass vaccination.
Duterte has been saying before that soldiers, policemen, medical frontliners, and the poorest of the poor would be prioritized in the vaccination.Right now, he said, they are in constant coordination with the Food and Drugs Administration in running after people who are either selling or injecting COVID-19 vaccine.
“We are talking with the FDA because these vaccines could be fake and this is dangerous,” said Sinas.

While the government has yet to approve the use of any COVID-19 vaccine, “some” members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), particularly from the Presidential Security Group (PSG), apparently have been vaccinated against the viral disease, the country’s top Philippine Army (PA) official confirmed Monday.
(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana, Army commanding general, said he personally knew some “officials and non-commissioned officers” who received the vaccine shots.The Army Chief’s revelation came in the wake of President Duterte’s pronouncement last Saturday that “many” Filipinos have already received China’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Sinopharm.Sobejana refused to identify them or the unit to which they belong.
“I know of some but I could not just disclose the unit. Personally, I know mayroon nang nabakunahan sa hanay po ng Armed Forces (some of the personnel of the Armed Forces have already been vaccinated),” Sobejana said in a radio interview over DWIZ.
“Hindi ko maibigay ang accurate number but I confirm that some of our members ay nabakunahan. Hindi naman libo. Considering the population of our Armed Forces, hindi ganoon karami (I could not give the accurate number but I confirm that some of our members were vaccinated. It did not reach thousands. Considering the population of the Armed Forces, it’s not that many),” he added.
But Major General Edgard Arevalo, AFP spokesperson, bared that they found out it was members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) from the AFP who were the first ones given by a COVID-19 vaccine shot.“As the unit primarily tasked to protect and secure the highest official of the land, the PSG will have to ensure that the President is safe from all threats—including COVID-19,” he said.
“Because the safety of the President equates to national well-being, that security posture should necessarily include protecting the Commander-in-Chief from contracting the deadly virus from those he is constantly exposed to like the members of his security detail,” he added.
It was not clear whether the soldiers who had been reportedly vaccinated are or have been COVID-19 patients but Sobejana said they were already “doing okay” and no negative effects were observed on them so far.
‘Unaware’The AFP leadership denied that there is an AFP-sanctioned COVID-19 vaccination among its personnel as it distanced itself from Sobejana’s remarks.
“The AFP is not aware of COVID-19 inoculation made to military personnel. We do not have an AFP leadership-sanctioned vaccination,” said Major General Edgard Arevalo, AFP spokesperson.
For his part, Sobejana said the vaccination of the soldiers was a decision made by the military higher-ups, even attributing it to President Duterte.
“Our President is our Commander in Chief in the AFP. I should say that it is from the chain of command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,” he said.
The Army Chief’s revelation came in the wake of President Duterte’s pronouncement last Saturday that “many” Filipinos have already received China’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Sinopharm.However, Sobejana did not particularly identify whether it was the Sinopharm vaccine that was given to the soldiers.
“Hindi ko alam anong klaseng vaccine but I know mayroon ng vaccine na naibigay (I don’t know what kind of vaccine but I know that a vaccine was already distributed),” he said.
Justify
To date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved the use of any COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
Under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 3720 or the amended Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, it states that any new drug “should have an authorization from the FDA based on an application containing full reports of investigations.”
This, the law states, is to show “whether or not such drug is safe, efficacious and of good quality for use based on clinical studies, prior to manufacture, sale, importation, exportation, distribution or transfer thereof.”
Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 and the designated vaccine czar, earlier warned that only the national government is duly authorized to procure and administer COVID-19 vaccines.
Galvez, a former AFP Chief, said any other offers of guaranteed access to any of the vaccines “is not only illegal but also life-threatening.”
Apparently setting the laws aside, Sobejana justified the decision of the soldiers to be vaccinated, saying they “did not hesitate” to do it so they can better protect themselves and serve the country.
“Mayroon naman po sigurong paliwanag ‘yung mga doctor na nagbigay ng bakuna sa kanila at hindi naman po sila nag-alinlangan (Maybe the doctors who gave the soldiers the vaccine have a good explanation as to why they did it, and they [soldiers] did not hesitate),” he said.
“We are optimistic na itong vaccine na naibigay sa mga sundalo ay magiging epektibo para lalo tayong makapagbigay serbisyo sa ating mga kababayan (We are optimistic that the vaccine given to our soldiers will be effective so we could better serve our countrymen,” he added.

The private sector is allowed to procure and bring in COVID-19 vaccines into the country from registered pharmaceutical companies under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act of Bayanihan 2, Senator Pia Cayetano said on Monday.

Cayetano issued the clarification as a co-sponsor in the Senate of Republic Act 11494, saying this is allowed dprovide they comply with the standards set by government authorities and existing laws.
“The government has no exclusive authority to procure and import COVID-19 vaccines. This is not debatable. The provision under Bayanihan 2 clearly states this,” Cayetano said in a statement.
Section 12 of the Bayanihan 2 law, states that “nothing in this Act shall prohibit private entities from conducting research, developing, manufacturing, importing, distributing or selling COVID-19 vaccine sourced from registered pharmaceutical companies, subject to the provisions of this Act and existing laws, rules and regulations.
The same Section, she pointed out, waives the requirement of Phase IV trials to expedite the procurement of said medication and vaccine, provided that the latter were recommended and approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and/or other international health agencies.
Likewise, she said the law mandates minimum standards for the distribution of said vaccines shall be set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC).
The senator noted that the private sector has been the government’s reliable partner in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.
“That Section 12 of Bayanihan 2 will remain in effect three months from December 19, 2020 or until March 19, 2021,” Cayetano said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sen. Pia Cayetano (Alexis Nueva España/Senate PRIB)
Cayetano, who chairs the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, expressed belief this could be a setback to the country’s COVID-19 immunization efforts, which is badly needed by the government to contain the pandemic.“I agree with the call of my House counterpart to exempt COVID-19 vaccines from tax,” said Cayetano, responding to House Ways and Means Committee chair Rep. Joey Salceda’s call for the government to make the vaccines tax-free.“In fact, VAT exemption is already provided in the CREATE bill, which the Senate passed on third and final reading last Nov. 26,” said Cayetano, who chairs the Senate Committee on Ways and Means.She said senators wanted a comprehensive list of exemptions to cover, not just the vaccines, but also all drugs, devices, raw materials, and capital equipment needed to help the government’s COVID-19 response.Under the Senate’s version of the bill, VAT exemption for the sale and importation of all drugs, vaccines, and medical devices specifically prescribed and directly used for the treatment of COVID-19 will start beginning January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023.Capital equipment, its spare parts, and raw materials necessary for the production of personnel protective equipment for COVID-19 prevention are supposedly also covered.The Senate also sought to exempt from VAT drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in clinical trials, including raw materials directly necessary for the production of such drugs for that same period.“This could have already been a law now if only the House of Representatives saw the merit in adopting our version before the session ended this year,” she lamented.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

American biotechnology company Moderna Inc. is accelerating a huge shipment of COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said Sunday.(Photo by ERNESTO BENAVIDES / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
He said the information came from Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez.
“More good news from Babe: Moderna on board and accelerating huge shipment. Everything’s falling back into place,” Locsin said in a tweet.“We will have a complete range of vaccines from least effective to most available for everyone to choose from,” he added.Romualdez had earlier said that the Philippines will be able to secure between up to 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna Inc. and Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. in the third quarter of 2021.But Locsin said no vaccine will be mass deployed “unless the official recommending it for mass deployment is seen taking it himself.”
“The only proof of the pudding is in the eating it oneself and no one else in his place until we see the side effects of the pudding if any,” the Foreign Affairs chief added.
Last Dec. 18,the US Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Moderna which will be distributed in the US for use in individuals 18-years-old and older.
It said Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA based on thetotality of the available data which provides clear evidence that it may be effective in preventing the dreaded novel coronavirus disease.American drugmaker Pfizer submitted its application for EUA of its COVID-19 vaccine to the Philippines Sunday, according to presidential spokesman Harry Roque.
Locsin said the country has so far secured 2.6 million doses from British drugmaker AstraZeneca through the help of the private sector.The Philippines has been assured of 30 million doses of Indian-made Novavax COVID-19 vaccine which may be made available by July.

Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri urged Malacanang Sunday to choose COVID-19 vaccines that have been peer-reviewed by the scientific community and have a higher percentage of efficacy.
(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Zubiri made the call after Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that a Chinese-made vaccine against COVID-19 that was at least 50 percent effective can be used for the government’s vaccination program.
The senator said it is imperative for the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) to choose a vaccine that has a higher efficacy rate and cost-effective, and, at the same time, have been reviewed by the scientific community.“Ayaw naman po namin mamilit, kasi pag namilit kami baka sabihin meron pang mga kickback ‘yung mga senador (We don’t want to insist, because if we do, they might accuse us senators of gaining kickbacks),” Zubiri said in an interview over radio DZBB.
“Ang gusto lang po namin, magkaroon ng recommendation na dapat ‘yan (vaccines na bibilhin) ay accepted ng scientific community, accepted ng buong mundo. Dahil may mga bansa talaga na hindi sila papayag na 50 percent efficacy (All we want is that the vaccines that would be recommended for procurement are accepted by the scientific community, accepted worldwide. Because there are countries that will not accept a 50 percent efficacy),” he said.
Even the Malaysian government, he said, has chosen to procure vaccines that have a higher effectivity rate and peer-reviewed.
“They will choose a vaccine with a higher effectivity, and peer-reviewed ng scientific community (and peer-reviewed by the scientific community),” Zubiri said.
“Ang masama kasi (What is bad), with all due respect to Sinopharm and the Chinese-made vaccines, hindi pa po sila na (they are not yet) peer-reviewed. In other words, wala pa pong findings na lumalabas na official findings ng bansa (The country has not yet released its official findings on the vaccine),” he added.
In contrast to US-made COVID-19 vaccines like Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca, the lawmaker stressed their studies were already peer-reviewed and at the same time are cost-effective and have a higher efficacy rate.“So bakit po tayo pipili ng bakuna na 50-50 chance na makuha mo pa rin ‘yung COVID-19 paglabas mo ng bahay? (So why will we choose a vaccine that has a 50-50 chance that you can still get infected by COVID-19 when you step out of the house?)” he said.
Besides, Zubiri said, even China ordered 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, as reported by international media outfits.
“We’re asking Malacanang to pick the best one. Kung pipili sila ‘yung pinakamaganda and pinakaepektibo na. Hindi ko na maintindihan, bakit ‘yung China nag-order din sila ng 100 million doses from Pfizer (If they’re going to choose, they should choose the best and most effective. I also don’t understand why China itself ordered 100 million doses from Pfizer),” he added.
Zubiri said buying COVID-19 vaccines that are less effective would only be a waste of government resources. “So let’s make the maximum use of it. Baka humiram tayo ng pera, mahirap ang bansa na kumita ngayon…napakaliit ng ating resources (We might have to resort to borrowing and yet it’s hard for the country to recover financially…We have limited resources),” he said.The government, he said, should not treat the matter of COVID-19 vaccine procurement lightly as getting infected with the coronavirus is no joke.“In all due honesty, for the sake of the Filipino people, let’s remember hindi po joke ang COVID (COVID-19 is no joke).

Duterte made the statement following an outburst against the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) during his meeting with members of the government’s pandemic task force and other health experts.
Duterte apologized to the participants of the meeting in Malacañang for going off-topic. He called the meeting to discuss the new COVID-19 strain.He said that every Filipino can get the vaccine.
“Maghingi ako ng tawad sa (I apologize to the) body for the outburst. Hindi ko mapigilan sarili ko, eh (I couldn’t hold myself back) because we arrived at this issue of whether they should be vaccinated,” he said.
“All, all Filipinos. Ang Abu Sayyaf, mag-report lang kayo sa military, sila ang mag-bakuna sa inyo (For the ASG, just report to the military and they will be the ones who will administer the vaccine to you),” he added.
But for the NPA, the President seemed to have a different reason for allowing them to receive the vaccine.“The vaccine is available to every Filipino citizen, including the communist NPAs so that you can fight better and you are healthy because I know that you will die,” Duterte said.
Duterte told the communist rebels during the meeting which coincided with their 52nd founding anniversary that they will surely die if they continue with their nefarious acts.
“‘Pag hindi talaga kayo naghinto, mamamatay talaga kayo lahat (If you do not stop, you will really die). That’s the… That’s the gospel truth of it all,” he said.

In his meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Diseases and other medical experts in Malacañang, Duterte said that he will not lie that a lot of people in the Philippines, particularly soldiers, have been vaccinated.
“Sabihin ko sa iyo, marami na ang nagpa-injection dito sa Sinopharm (Let me tell you, there are many here who were already injected the Sinopharm vaccine),” he said.“Halos lahat ng sundalo natusukan na (Almost all soldiers received it). I have to be frank and I have to tell the truth. I will not foist a lie,” he added.
According to the President, he has yet to hear negative side effects among those who received the Sinopharm vaccine.
The military is among the priority list of people in the Philippines who will receive the vaccine. During the meeting, Duterte reiterated that he wanted the members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to get the vaccine first so they can perform their jobs well.
“Pero gusto ko mauna sila (I want them to go first) because I do not want a sickly Armed Forces and a sickly police (force),” he said.
“The reason why is that they have to be in good health all the time because they are responsible for the law and order of this country,” he added.
Duterte’s claim about the early vaccination came following reports of unauthorized vaccinations in Binondo, Manila.
During the meeting, Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo said they have not caught anyone performing or involved in the illegal vaccinations.
“Wala nga po kaming mahuli (We haven’t caught anybody),” Domingo told the President.
“Naka-tatlong raid na po kami sa Makati at saka sa Binondo pero wala naman po kaming nahuli pa (We conducted three raids in Makati and Binondo but we’ve caught no one),” he added.
A report by the South China Morning Post said that China’s Centre for Drug Evaluation is reviewing Sinopharm’s application to release one of its two candidates to the market.
The two COVID-19 vaccines have been undergoing testing for safety and efficacy in 10 countries across South America and the Middle East. Early this month, the United Arab Emirates approved one of them for use, saying it was 86 percent effective.No vaccine, no VFA
President Duterte warned the United States Saturday that he will proceed with the abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) if it fails to produce 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the Philippines.
Duterte asked the public not to believe in reports that the US initially committed to give the Philippines 10 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech by January, saying the US cannot even distribute the vaccines in its own country.
He, instead, put the US government on notice that if it fails to provide the Philippines with COVID-19 vaccines, it can say goodbye to the idea of staying in the country.
“Iyong Visiting Forces Agreement, matatapos na. Ngayon kapag hindi ako pumayag aalis talaga sila (The VFA is about to end. Now if I don’t agree with the terms, they will have to get out),” he said.
“Kung hindi sila maka-deliver, maski na a (Now, if they fail to deliver even just a) minimum of 20 million (doses of) vaccines, they better get out. No vaccine, no stay here,” he added.

The chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means has called on the government to exempt COVID-19 vaccines from Value-Added Tax and import duties.
After pushing strongly for a number of tax measures aimed at increasing government income, Albay Rep. Joey Sarte Salceda now wants COVID-19 vaccine importation freed from any tax loads, saying that these “are friction costs and administrative burdens that could delay vaccine procurement and distribution.”
(Cong. Joey Salceda’s office / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
He said the government must start stockpiling syringes and address swiftly the need for cold storage facilities and other immunization requisites.Salceda, vice chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, said the private sector should be given enough leeway to help the government immediately and effectively address the COVID-19 problem.
“On the question of whether the private sector should be able to import the COVID-19 vaccines without taxes and duties, my answer is an unambiguous yes,” he said.
Salceda added: “Each day that we are unable to return to the ‘old normal’ costs the economy P85 billion at least. The benefit of removing the tariff and tax barriers to importing COVID-19 vaccines is critical to fast-tracking mass vaccination by several days.”
According to the veteran administration congressman, “a cost benefit analysis he conducted indicated “very clearly on the side of frictionless importation.”“Every day will be lifesaving,” Salceda stressed.
At the same time, Salceda called for the immediate passage of the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or the CREATE Act.The bill contains a provision for VAT exemption for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.
“Of course, that has to be subject to some limits of time, but generally, the government should not try to collect on drugs and vaccines for this health emergency,” Salceda said.He added that the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA) allows the President to suspend duties for COVID-19 vaccines.
“Under Chapter 2, Section 1608 of the CMTA, or the ‘Flexible Clause,’ President Duterte can suspend the tariffs on COVID-19 vaccines, upon the recommendation of the NEDA. We can also legislate this. I am in constant communication with the economic managers, so, once the first shipments are ready, we can easily recommend the suspension of duties,” he said.
Salceda also said that the government should plan and prepare contingencies for stockpiling syringes, needles, and other mass vaccination needs.
“As you know, the world is in some sort of vaccination rush, so one can expect shortages of syringes, needles, and other vaccination needs. We are looking at four to seven billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines being administered in 2021 and 2022. We need to have contingencies. Congress is ready to appropriate the necessary funding, but we need a good plan from the executive,” Salceda said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Agusan del Norte Rep. Lawrence Fortun questioned the Philippine government’s decision to select China’s Sinovacwhich has an efficacy rate of 50 percent as the COVID-19 vaccine for Filipinos.
(NOEL CELIS / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)
“Why settle for 50 percent efficacy when we can go for thevaccines with 95 percent efficacy? Let us give our people the best protection they deserve. Buhay ng mamamayang Pilipino ang nakataya dito. (The lives of the Filipino people are at stake here),” Fortun said.
According to the member of the House minority bloc, it would be “nonsense”for the Filipinos and the Duterte government to choose the China vaccine “at this point.”He noted that the vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna have up to 95 percent and 94 percent efficacy based on Phase 3 clinical trial results while the China vaccine has yet to complete Phase 3 testing and available information showed only 50 percent efficacy and costing about the same as the vaccines with 94 to 95 percent efficacy.
“Our government must not give in to any overture, pressure, or campaigning by the Chinese government, the Chinese Embassy, or any of their proxies. Our government should abandon any prior verbal agreement they may have had. They should politely decline the offers about Sinovac,” Fortun said.“Our DoST (Department of Science and Technology) scientists and DoH (Department of Health) authorities must not give way to any pressure from either the Chinese government or our national political leaders as regards Sinovac.”
Fortun thanked the DoST-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) for publicly disclosing that the Sinovac vaccine from China has only 50 percent efficacy.“They were simply stating how Sinovac is at the minimum range of the bar applicant vaccines are supposed to hurdle. The Filipino people must now express to the IATF and to Malacanang what they prefer to be administered to them when their turn comes for vaccination against COVID-19,” he said.He said every Filipino needs only needs common sense to compare the vaccine choices.“No sane Filipino should allow himself or herself to be injected with a vaccine like Sinovac which barely hurdled the minimum standards.”
“Whatever political game was afoot involving Sinovac, it is now game over, thanks to the DoST scientists who decided to reveal the truth about Sinovac.”
DoST-PCHRD Executive Director Jaime Montoya had earlier described as “acceptable” the50 percent efficacy of China’s Sinovac vaccine, explaining that “it is the minimum requirement set by the World Health Organization for a vaccine to be used by the country.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Albay Representative Joey Salceda on Friday urged the government to ensure that the importation of the COVID-19 vaccines would be exempted from any duties and value added tax (VAT) to lessen administrative costs and burdens that could delay procurement and distribution.

Salceda, House Ways and Means Committee chief, said the benefits of removing the tariff and tax barriers to importing COVID-19 vaccines is critical to expediting mass vaccination by several days.
“Each day that we are unable to return to the ‘old normal’ costs the economy P85-billion at least,” Salceda said in a statement.
“The cost-benefit analysis appears to me to be very clearly on the side of frictionless importation. Every day will be life-saving,” the House’s tax chief said.
The lawmaker explained that one of the compelling reasons the Lower House is agreeing to the passage of the proposed Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or the CREATE bill is due to its provision exempting COVID-19 vaccines and drugs from VAT.
“Of course, that has to be subject to some time limits, but generally, government should not try to collect on drugs and vaccines for this health emergency,” he said.
He added that the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA) allows the President to suspend duties for COVID-19 vaccines.
“Under Chapter 2, Section 1608 of the CMTA, or the ‘Flexible Clause’, President Duterte can suspend the tariffs on COVID-19 vaccines, upon the recommendation of the NEDA (National Economic Development Authority (NEDA). We can also legislate this,” the solon said.
“I am in constant communication with the economic managers, so, once the first shipments are ready, we can easily recommend the suspension of duties,” Salceda pointed out.
Salceda said the government should also stockpile on syringes, cold-storage and other COVID-related supplies and equipment and be able to plan and prepare for contingencies.
“The world is in some sort of vaccination rush, so one can expect shortages of syringes, needles and other vaccination needs. We are looking at 4 to 7 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines being administered in 2021 and 2022,” he stressed.
“We need to have contingencies. Congress is ready to appropriate the necessary funding, but we need a good plan from the Executive,” he reiterated. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

If there is one Christmas wish asked of them this year, senators said they would wish for free access to COVID-19 vaccines for all Filipinos and an end to the pandemic.

Detained Senator Leila de Lima said this is her heartfelt desire for the country, aside from her wish to be free and vindicated from all the trumped-up drug charges that were filed against her.
De Lima said Christmas remains to be the season of hope and the time to give back and be grateful.
“For our country, I wish that every Filipino will be given access to the COVID-19 vaccine so that all can move on from this pandemic without worrying for their health and safety,” De Lima said.
“Let’s give to our COVID-19 frontliners, typhoon and disaster responders, and the individuals and groups who reach out to those who need help the most during times of disaster out of generosity and a pure desire to help,” she further said.
“Their sacrifices made our sufferings bearable and humane. They gifted us with their love, and some of them with their lives, through their selfless acts of heroism. Let’s honor them and show them how grateful we are,” she added.
Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara said the year 2020 is undoubtedly “one of the most challenging and difficult times in our history.”
But Filipinos, he said, should never lose hope, even if the COVID-19 pandemic was totally unexpected “and changed all of our lives.”
“No one was spared. Then the storms came, in succession, battering several parts of Luzon and leaving our already struggling kababayans down on their knees. Rarely have our people been through so much hardship and suffering in such a short period of time,” Angara said.
“But as Filipinos, we never lose hope. No matter how daunting the trials that come our way, we always see the silver lining and find reasons to smile.
Nevertheless, Angara noted how Filipinos are already seeing glimpses of normalcy back in their daily lives.
“Businesses are starting to open up again and people are feeling more comfortable about leaving their homes,” he pointed out.
“And with several vaccines very close to distribution, we are hopeful that 2021 will be a better year for us all,” Angara added.
“We may not be able to celebrate in the same way we have in previous years– we may be forced to meet with our friends and family virtually, but this Christmas will be no less meaningful,” he stressed.
For her part, Sen. Nancy Binay said that despite the many trials experienced by Filipinos in the year 2020, she finds it heartening to know that there are Filipinos who would always be willing and ready to lend a hand and a heart whenever life gets rough.
“May we always find hope and joy in celebrating Christmas as we share our hearts full of compassion, and faith. So, let us share happiness and the love in our hearts to lift the spirits and improve the lives of those who have lost their homes, jobs, livelihood, and loved ones,” Binay said.
“As a nation, we had to brave storms and endure the many challenges posed by these trying times. But all these shall pass as we find love and hope this Christmas and the year ahead,” she stressed.
Meantime, senator Richard J. Gordon, chairman and CEO of the Philippine Red Cross (PRC), on Friday prayed that Filipinos continue to find happiness during these trying times, most especially this holiday season.
‘’May we continue to pray to the Lord Jesus Christ for the safety of our families from the threat of COVID-19 and to awaken our consciousness to the injustices rampant in our country today so that we may be men and women of action, service, and change,’’ Gordon, chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon committee, said.
‘’May we may never cease to be a blessing to others amidst all the challenges we have braved this year, and may we continue to find happiness during these trying times, most especially this holiday season,’’ he added. (With a report from Mario B. Casayuran) SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Ankara in the next few days will also sign a deal with Pfizer/BioNTech for 4.5 million doses, with the option to buy 30 million more from the US pharmaceutical giant and its German partner, Koca said
Turkey will initially receive three million doses of Sinovac and have the option for 50 million more as it begins inoculations next month, starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable.Koca said the first shipments of the Chinese vaccine will be sent to Turkey on Sunday.
The preliminary tests on 7,371 volunteers in Turkey showed that the Chinese vaccine was 91.25 per cent effective, although phase three tests were still not complete.
Turkey “will be able to vaccinate 1.5 million or even two million people per day,” Koca said, adding that the “first stage” of vaccinations would cover nine million people.

The head of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) has expressed hope that the government can soon obtain the vaccines against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and make them available to the people.
Davao Archbishop Romulo Valles said this in his Christmas message released December 23.
“Once accepted by most, if not by all, these vaccines can reduce the numbers headed for the ICUs and hospitals,” he said.“People can return to work, earn a living, and go back to school. And the day may not be far off when we will no longer need to wear masks, do social distancing, or be obsessed with disinfectants,” added Valles.
Although grateful to the men and women of science who produced the wonderful vaccines, he said, they also recognize their limits.“They are good for COVID-19 only. They cannot be effective against the next virus which, many experts say, will surely appear and unleash the next pandemic,” said Valles.
The prelate, however, said that no vaccine can be a panacea for all the misguided ways by which humans live.
“We bring about our own plagues and pandemics. We abuse nature. We wage wars. We tolerate, if not exacerbate, poverty and inequality,” said Valles.
“We know we can do better, yet we persist in our lack of humanity,” he added.
But the CBCP head said the birth of Christ offers hope to the people.
“He is born for us, for our benefit, and for no other reason. He is here to save us from ourselves, from our pettiness, and from our hardness of hearts,” Valles said.
“If we only let Him, He will teach us how to live life fully, with or without a pandemic. He is our Savior and our God,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Canada has approved the Covid-19 vaccine developed by American biotech firm Moderna, the health department announced Wednesday, two weeks after authorizing immunizations with the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.
The decision makes Canada the second country to green light the Moderna vaccine, after the US.
“Health Canada… has determined that the Moderna vaccine meets the department’s stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements,” it said in a statement.The authorization is a “critical step,” the statement continued.
“The different storage and handling requirements of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine mean that it can be distributed to isolated and remote communities, including the territories,” it added.
The Moderna vaccine can be stored at -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit), much warmer than Pfizer’s vaccine which must be kept at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), making it easier to distribute.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said previously that Canada is set to receive up to 168,000 doses of Moderna’s vaccine before the end of December, part of the guaranteed 40 million it has secured.
Delivery could begin within 48 hours of the Moderna vaccine’s approval, he said earlier this month.Canada began vaccinating people in high-risk categories — including frontline health care workers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities — on December 14, with its relatively limited supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use a cutting-edge technology based on mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) which makes the human cells they enter express a surface protein of the new coronavirus.This simulates an infection and trains the immune system to be ready in case it encounters the real virus.In total, Canada — a country of 38 million — has placed orders or options on more than 400 million doses of vaccine from seven pharmaceutical groups.The country will share any excess doses with other countries, Trudeau has said.
Canada plans to vaccinate three million people by the end of the first quarter of 2021.The country, where the spread of the virus accelerated as the holiday season approached, on Wednesday had recorded more than 523,000 cases of coronavirus and nearly 14,500 deaths since the start of the pandemic.

Transmission firm National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) is seeking lawmakers’ imprimatur for it to be allowed to import Covid-19 vaccine tax-free as these doses will be used for its employees.NGCP President Anthony L. Almeda said with this gesture from the State, businesses would be able to bounce back and they could consequently “give the economy much-needed boost in activity.”The transmission company also has various activities and projects affected by the pandemic, therefore, it will be very crucial for it to bring in vaccine the soonest possible time especially for its employees since NGCP’s line of business and function is very critical in ensuring the country’s reliable electricity supply.
NGCP has massive human resources of 5,000, and the company admitted that it has been closely monitoring the progress and rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in other countries.Taking cue from developments on the other parts of the world, the transmission firm indicated that it is also prudently assessing the possibility of providing vaccine doses to its employees, including its essential workers like grid dispatchers and transmission personnel.Relative to NGCP’s appeal, Almeda propounded for a passage of a law “encouraging the private sector to provide vaccination to its employees.”He explained that “vaccination, as well as mass testing, is focally critical in the fight against Covid-19,”adding that with these measures, entities like them would be able to “prevent, detect, isolate and treat” personnel who would be affected in the workplace.Almeda similarly pointed out “we need to jumpstart the economy now, but we need to ensure that we stack the odds against infections in the workplace.”He thus emphasized that “with a vaccination program in place for the private sector, more businesses and industries will be able to regain some semblance of normal activity, bounce back and put the economy on its way to recovery after almost a year of slowdown.”
As the world is now on its last stretch into accessing the ‘cure’ to the niggling pandemic, Almeda similarly called on counterparts and peers in the private and public sectors “to be similarly proactive in protecting their employees, so that we can keep the economy running at full speed.”And while the company waits for the vaccine and continues to operate efficiently, it noted that it has been stepping up on its commitment “to enforce all health and safety protocols,” as mandated by the Department of Health and the Department of Labor and Employment.NGCP further stated that it keeps on with its drive in helping local governments, national health agencies and various agencies in battling the health crisis.

Senator Sherwin Gatchalian on Wednesday urged the government to include public school teachers in the prioritized groups that would benefit in the COVID-19 vaccination program, together with non-teaching staff and school administrators.

Gatchalian, chair of the Senate Committee on Basic Education, Arts and Culture, said prioritizing teachers in the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is a crucial step to ensure the safety of school premises and in building confidence for the gradual resumption of face-to-face classes.
“Dahil ang mga guro, mga punong-guro, at kawani ng mga paaralan ay nagsisilbing mga frontliners sa pagpapatuloy ng edukasyon, nararapat lamang na mabilang sila sa mga unang makakatanggap ng bakuna laban sa COVID-19 (because teachers, principals and school administrators serve as frontliners to ensure continuity of education, it is only fitting that they are the first to receive this vaccine against COVID-19),” Gatchalian said in a statement.
Since the pandemic struck, Gatchalian noted that the country’s more than 900,000 teachers and non-teaching staff have been serving as frontliners to ensure learning continuity for more than 22 million learners.
But despite the social restrictions imposed by the National Task Force Against COVID-19, the senator stressed the need for schools to reopen as soon as possible to prevent an exacerbation of the learning crisis hounding the country.
The lawmaker pointed out the Philippines is lagging globally and failing to master basic competencies as shown in global assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2019, and the Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics (SEA-PLM) 2019.
All of these international student assessment tests, he said, were administered before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gatchalian recalled that when teachers were preparing for the implementation of distance learning, they distributed learning materials used by almost 87 percent of public school learners even at the risk of their health and safety.
“Mahalagang hakbang ito upang matiyak nating ang pagbabalik n gating mga magaaral sa mga paaralan ay magiging ligtas (This is a crucial step for us to ensure that the resumption of classes in schools will be safe),” he said.
The Department of Education (DepEd) is already bracing for a dry run of limited and localized face-to-face classes in selected schools ahead of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
However, Gatchalian reiterated the need to strictly observe health protocols such as physical distancing, wearing of face masks and regular hand washing to protect students against the threat of the coronavirus despite the possibility of starting limited face-to-face classes.

The government is hoping to secure 60 million more doses of coronavirus vaccines in the second and third quarter of 2021 if certain supply deals could be finalized this month.
Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 (NTF AGAINST COVID-19 / MANILA BULLETIN)
In a meeting with President Duterte Monday night, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government was in the middle of talks with the Novavax and AstraZeneca vaccine makers to secure supplies for the country.
“Natutuwa po kami, Mr. President, marami pong positive results at ikukuwento po namin sa inyo (We are happy Mr. President. We have many positive results we want to share with you),” Galvez said in his remarks aired on State television Monday.Galvez informed the President that Serum Institute of India has agreed to provide 30 million doses of vaccines to the Philippines on a “non-profit, no loss concept” where the vaccines will be given at lower cost. “A vaccine shot will cost around $5 or “P500 for two shots,” he added.
He said the country representative of the Indian company also assured him that it would not seek cash advance for the country’s vaccine acquisition. “Ibig sabihin ‘yung lahat po ng transaction po natin magiging flexible. And he will comply with your guidance na wala pong cash advance (This means all transactions will be flexible and he will comply with your guidance that there will be no cash advance),” he said.
More discussions with the Novavax manufacturer will be held this Wednesday, Galvez said.
“Makakausap po namin siya this coming Dec. 23 at nag-assure po siya na magbibigay po siya ng 30 million doses para po sa atin. Iyon po ay ‘yung Novavax. This is an American brand na gagawin po sa India (We will talk to them this coming Dec. 23 and they have assured it will give 30 million doses to us. That’s Novavax. This is an American brand that will be made in India),” he said.Another supply deal with United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca for an additional 30 million more doses may be finalized within the month if it secures approval from United Kingdom’s regulatory authorities, according to Galvez.
The government in partnership with the private sector signed last month a supply deal for 2.6 million vaccine doses from AstraZeneca.
“Hindi po tayo bibitawan ng AstraZeneca (AstraZeneca will not let us go),” Galvez told the President.“Baka this coming next week, either Dec. 28 o 29, inaantay lang po namin ‘yung — ‘yung Ministry of Health Regulatory Authorization ng UK at puwede na po naming pirmahan ‘yung ano po, ‘yung kontrata. Ito naman po ay 20 million doses at 10 million doses for LGU at saka po sa ating private sector (Maybe this coming next week, either Dec. 28 or 29, we are just waiting for the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Health regulatory authorization and we can sign the contract. This involves 20 million doses and 10 million doses for the local government units and our private sector),” he said.
“So all in all po, kung magkakaroon po tayo ng pirmahan this coming month, mayroon po tayong 60 million for the second quarter at saka third quarter po (So all in all, if we can have the contract signing this month, we will have 60 million for the second quarter and third quarter),” he said.
The government identified P73 billion in funding sources for the acquisition of coronavirus vaccines. The free vaccines will be initially be distributed to around 24.6 million priority beneficiaries including the country’s health workers, seniors, poor citizens, and uniformed personnel.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III had earlier said inoculating 60 million Filipinos with the COVID vaccines could be enough to attain herd immunity against the illness. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

TAGBILARAN CITY—The Bohol Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) plans to raise a P10-million seed fund to buy COVID-19 vaccines for the private sector frontline workers to ensure their protection from the virus.
BCCI member Atty. Lucas Nunag told an online Kapihan sa PIA radio forum that for a person to have enough protection against the COVID-19 virus, one must spend between P150 to P1,850 for the two doses of vaccine and between P2,500 to P4,500 for the standard test called Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).
Nunag said that should the BCCI succeed in this fund-raising campaign, all store keepers, sales clerks, promo merchandisers, drivers, conductors, laborers, construction workers, and those working for their companies under the BCCI can be inoculated.He added that if the tourism industry stakeholders and establishment owners here could raise enough funds from local sources, it would be easier to leverage the same for national funds as counterpart.
Nunag, who owns a tropical resort in Panglao, added that this would be a pro-active move towards economic recovery and would send a reassuring message to tourists that Bohol is a safe destination.
“We would rather go for a P1,800 double dose of the vaccine than spend P4,500 for a simple test which does not yet cover treatment costs.The sooner we can raise the funds, the better it would be for Bohol,” Nunag added.
Nunag leads the Provincial Tourism Council (PTC) in Bohol and has been at the forefront of re-opening Bohol’s tourism. If the plan pushes through, Boholano workers can be well protected from the virus and enhance the confidence of the tourists to come to Bohol, he said.This can also help the people and the local economy to recover from the crippling impact of the pandemic.Nunag admitted that it might take long before Bohol can return to pre-COVID normal but said everything must be put in place for the reopening of Bohol to tourists.

Speaking on a conference call ahead of the start of the 2020-2021 season on Tuesday, Silver emphasised that the NBA would “wait our turn” to obtain the vaccine, which began to be administered for the first time last week.
“It goes without saying that in no form or way will we jump the line,” Silver told reporters. “We will wait our turn to get the vaccine.”Silver said he hoped NBA players and staff would eventually play a role in helping to assure the public of the benefits of getting the vaccine.
“It’s my hope that when we are eligible, members of the NBA community will want to get vaccinated and it’s our plan to be involved with governmental efforts in terms of public messaging as to the benefit of taking the vaccine,” he said.
The NBA was shut down for four months last season as the pandemic swept across North America before resuming in July with teams based in a protective quarantine bubble in Orlando, Florida.
However the new season will take place with teams playing in their home markets, a move that represents myriad logistical challenges for the NBA and its 30 teams amid skyrocketing Covid-19 cases in many states.
Season bubble ‘untenable’Silver said playing an entire season in a bubble-like campus environment was deemed to be “untenable” but insisted he was confident of health and safety protocols put in place to mitigate the risk from the virus.
“I’ve been asked many times ‘Why are you starting your season now, given the state of the pandemic?'” Silver said.
“It’s a fair question and the short answer is that we’re comfortable with the health and safety protocols we’ve designed in consultation with the players association and our medical experts.“We would not be opening our season if we did not believe it was safe and responsible to do so.”
Silver added however that the league was preparing for disruption, referring to a sense of “trepidation” about Tuesday’s tip-off.
NBA chiefs have only released a schedule of games for the first half of the abbreviated 72-game season, and will finalise the second half of the calender at a later date.
“We do anticipate there will be bumps in the road along the way,” Silver said. “We’re waiting to see how this plays out before issuing the second half of the season. We know it’s possible we may have to reschedule games along the way.”
Silver said only six teams would start the season with fans in attendance at their arenas and described the return of spectators as a “huge priority.”
Anthem hope“But at the same time I recognise that until we have mass distribution of the vaccine it’s unlikely that we’re going to return to the point of having full arenas,” he cautioned, adding that the league estimated a 40% dip in total revenues if no fans at all were present during the season.
Silver meanwhile said that after the social justice initiatives adopted last season following the death of George Floyd in May, when “Black Lives Matter” adorned every court following the restart and players kneeled for the national anthem, he hoped players would return to standing for the anthem.
“It’s a national ritual of sorts that I hope, personally, isn’t something that’s lost,” Silver said.
“Because there are very few things that bring us together these days. So it’s my expectation that going into the season we’re going to return to the practice that’s been part of this league for many decades, and that is standing for the national anthem.”
NBA rules require players to stand for the pre-game anthem ritual.
Silver emphasised however that the league would not punish players who chose to protest the anthem by taking a knee.
“It’s a complicated issue,” he said. “Certainly, I’m not focusing in any way right now on discipline. I recognise this is a very emotional issue on both sides. I think it calls for engagement rather than simply rule enforcement.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Vatican on Monday urged Catholics to get vaccinated against coronavirus and said it was “morally acceptable” to take vaccines that use cell lines from aborted foetuses.
Cells derived from foetuses aborted decades ago have been used by some researchers racing to find a vaccine against coronavirus.
The Vatican acknowledged that the issue was a cause of concern for some Catholics but said in a note that “it is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted foetuses in their research and production process”.The use of such vaccines “does not constitute formal cooperation with the abortion from which the cells used in production of the vaccines derive,” it said.
The Vatican added that while vaccination “must be voluntary… in the absence of other means to stop or even prevent the epidemic, the common good may recommend vaccination, especially to protect the weakest and most exposed”.Those who refuse to use vaccines “must do their utmost to avoid” spreading infection, it added.
The note also highlighted the “moral imperative” of the pharmaceutical industry, governments and international organisations to ensure that vaccines “are also accessible to the poorest countries”. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

US President-elect Joe Biden received a Covid-19 vaccine live on television Monday in a campaign to boost Americans’ confidence in the jabs — and in marked contrast to President Donald Trump’s mixed messaging.
US President-elect Joe Biden receives a Covid-19 vaccination from Tabe Masa, Nurse Practitioner, at the Christiana Care hospital in Newark, Delaware
The 78-year-old incoming president got the Pfizer vaccine at the Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. His wife Jill received the shot earlier, the presidential transition team said.
Biden told Americans “there’s nothing to worry about” when they get vaccinated and that in the meantime they should keep wearing masks and “listen to the experts.”He and the future first lady were the latest high-profile political figures publicly joining the first wave of vaccinations aimed at stopping a pandemic that has killed almost 318,000 Americans.
Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband will be vaccinated next week.
Meanwhile, the serving vice president, Mike Pence, and his wife got vaccinations last week. Trump, however, has yet to take part in the drive.
The Republican leader — who has become consumed by pushing conspiracy theories that his election loss to Biden was the result of mass fraud — cites the natural immunity he is believed to enjoy after recovering from a bout of coronavirus.Surgeon general Jerome Adams reinforced that argument at the weekend that, saying that due to the antibodies the president received from his infection, “that is actually one scenario where we tell people maybe you should hold off on getting the vaccine.”
However, he has done little, even in terms of issuing statements, to support the campaign to overcome Americans’ vaccine skepticism.
His wife, Melania Trump, who likewise contracted Covid-19, has also been largely absent from the issue.The inconsistent messaging is part of a pattern with Trump, who throughout the pandemic has veered from declaring himself a wartime leader to scoffing at scientists and insisting that the disease will go away without major changes in Americans’ daily lives.
– Oldest to assume presidency –
Biden will be the oldest president ever to take office on January 20.
This was the first shot in the two-stage Pfizer vaccine and he said he was “looking forward” to the follow-up.
Biden praised “the scientists and the people who put this together — frontline workers, people who were the ones who actually did the clinical work.”
He called medical workers “amazing and incredible.”
Biden also had some rare praise for the Trump administration, which he said “deserves some credit” for overseeing record-speedy development and production of vaccines.
Distribution of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines began a week ago and on Monday a second vaccine, this time made by Moderna, went into use.
But Biden, who spoke through a double mask, cautioned that there was still a long way to go before the inoculations can really halt the virus’ spread.
“It’s worth stating that, you know, this is just the beginning,” he said. “It’s going to take time.”
“In the meantime,” he said, “I hope people listen to all the experts… talking about the need to wear masks” during the holidays.
“If you don’t have to travel, don’t travel. It’s really important.”
Large numbers of Americans subscribe to the anti-vaccination movement and hostility to the Covid-19 vaccines in particular has been stirred by right-wing media personalities and conspiracy theorists.
There are also swaths of the country where mask wearing sees little adherence — and in some cases is actively opposed. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Save the Children said that even as some of the first wave of vaccines are currently being reserved for all countries, the governments of richer countries should not “hoard the limited initial supply” of available vaccines. Instead, these countries must ensure distribution based on needs and not on wealth.
“Countries who can afford life-saving vaccines should not have access over countries who cannot – one life is not worth more than another,” said Save the Children Global Director for Health and Nutrition Kathryn Bolles.Bolles noted that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to infect hundreds of thousands of people every day, claiming more than 1.6 million lives so far across the globe.“That means children are losing their parents, family members, teachers, and health care workers, which is deeply impacting their lives and the lives of their families,” she said. “The economies they live in are hard hit, pushing them into poverty. It’s unfair that some poorer countries must wait months or possibly longer for the vaccine,” she added.
When the COVID-19 outbreak started, Bolles said that there were global commitments that people in lower and middle income countries should have equal access to any vaccine — but “it seems that notion has shifted”
Bolles said that wealthier governments should not choose nationalism but instead uphold the spirit of equitable global access, including supporting COVAX to urgently provide support to ensure people around the world are vaccinated. As thousands of people continue to die every day from COVID-19, and hundreds of thousands more are infected, time is of the essence, she added.
“Governments must commit to expanding the supply, access and availability of vaccines, and all involved need to support the sharing of COVID-19 data and technology by committing to C-TAP, the COVID-19 technology access pool,” Bolles said. “Investment and collaboration with vaccine manufacturers in developing countries should also be prioritized to unleash supply to local and regional populations.”
Bolles noted that while it is understandable that it will be difficult to ensure equal access to the initial supply of vaccines, but “governments must do what they can to make sure it’s as fair as possible and not further accelerate the huge global inequities we face today.”
The COVID-19 pandemic, Bolles said, has stressed that “our own protection is rooted in the protection of others – no one safe until everyone is safe.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The department cited the report of Labor Attache’ David Des Dicang to Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III saying the vaccines may be made available by the Qatari government to OFWs for free.
The Philippine Labor Office in Qatar said the Arab state got its first batch of the COVID-19 vaccine December 21.According to Dicang, Qatar Prime Minister and concurrent Minister of Interior Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin AbdulazizAl Thani directed the health sector to provide the vaccine to everyone in accordance with the health standards of Qatar.
Citing an update from the Advisor to the Minister of Public Healthfor Sports and Emergency Affairs,Dr. Abdul Wahab Al Musle, he saidthe vaccine that was developed by Pfizer and BioNTech will be first administered to theelderly people, those with chronic diseases, and the frontline health workers.The report, according to Dicang, added that the general population will start getting the vaccines gradually from January, 2021.COVID-19 vaccination, however, is not required as the public will be given the option of not receiving the vaccine once the government starts to administer it.
Meanwhile, in an online forum, Dicang revealed receiving a request for healthcare workers coming from the Philippines.
“There was a time even at the height of the COVID-19 (pandemic)…the Qatar government, the Ministry of Public Health, has a request to get more health workers and we have been receiving requests until today,” he said.“We have a good number of health workers here. In almost all hospitals we have (Filipino) nurses, doctors,” added Dicang.
He said there are 240,000 OFWs in Qatar and more than 3,000 of them are healthcare workers. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

ILOILO CITY—The Department of Health (DOH) has identified Iloilo and Bacolod City as the two priority areas in Western Visayas region for the distribution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines.
Department of Health (DOH) (MANILA BULLETIN)
“Technically, we call Iloilo and Bacolod as the two focused areas,” said DOH-6’s Chief for Infectious Diseases Dr. Jane Juanico.
“But we do not yet know if the DOH Central Office was referring to Iloilo City or Iloilo province,” Juanico told Manila Bulletin in an interview on Monday, December 21.Iloilo City is the capital of Western Visayas, while Iloilo province has 42 towns and the component city of Passi.
Once the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available in the region, Juanico said the first ones to be vaccinated will be frontline health workers. These would include doctors, nurses and other medical staff of hospitals and medical facilities, who have direct contact with those who tested positive for COVID-19.
In the same manner, senior citizens and the indigents will also be among the top priority for the COVID-19 vaccinations.
Second to be prioritized for the COVID-19 vaccine will be those working in barangay (village) or town health facilities, including barangay health workers.Third in the COVID-19 vaccine priority list will be workers for national government agencies, who have been augmenting services for COVID-19 responses both with the DOH and local government units.Included in this category are personnel of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), Office of Civil Defense (OCD), Department of Education (DepEd), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP).

Go, chairman of the Senate Health and Demography Committee, stated that the private sector has also been raising funds to assist the country in acquiring sufficient numbers of vaccines for Filipinos.He said that the country is aiming to finalize its negotiations with Sinovac Biotech to acquire 25 million doses of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine for delivery by March next year.
The senator from Davao said that vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. is at present in advanced discussions with the vaccine company to strike a deal that will be beneficial to the country’s fight against COVID-19.“Our vaccine czar is currently talking to several possible sources. He has an advanced discussion with Sinovac, and the possible shipment of twenty five million doses in March, 2021,” Go said in Filipino.
Go said that he does not believe that the procurement of vaccines from Chinese company Sinovac has anything to do with preference, stressing that market availability is the primary consideration of the government for conducting negotiations with the company for the vaccines.He said that Galvez is also in talks with several other vaccine companies that could supply the country with the COVID-19 vaccines.
“There are ongoing talks with Gamaleya and an advanced discussion with Pfizer. For Johnson & Johnson, the (confidentiality disclosure agreement) is being finalized, AstraZeneca, for another twenty million,” he said.

Agriculture Secretary William Dar admitted that farmers are not a priority in the government-led distribution of COVID-19 vaccine, but vowed to look for vaccines for the agriculture sector where players are also considered frontliners.
“The priority right now are frontliners [but] mostly medical, soldiers, police, and senior citizens,” Dar said when asked in a virtual briefing if farmers will also receive the vaccine once the government finally sealed a deal with providers.

Dar assured that the Department of Agriculture (DA) will continuously coordinate with the private sector, mentioning Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion, so that farmers will also be given priority in future mass COVID-19 vaccination.Since the start of the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, DA has repetitively appealed to local government units (LGU) to consider farmers, fishermen, and other personnel, directly and indirectly, working in food production as COVID-19 frontliners.
This, so that they should be allowed entry through checkpoints amid strict lockdown restrictions. In the end, despite logistical issues, farmers and fishermen were still able to deliver, saving the Philippines from the risk of facing a food shortage amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that from July to September, farm sector’s production grew by 0.7 percent. During the quarter, increases in production were noted for crops and fisheries, while livestock and poultry posted reductions in outputs. At current prices, the value of agricultural production grew by 4.1 percent to P404.6 billion from the previous year’s level of P388.5 billion.As the country works towards securing vaccines for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) stressed that the distribution of these vaccines must be made equitable and accessible to everyone, an earlier report in Manila Bulletin showed.CHR Commissioner Gwen Pimentel-Gana said this a few weeks after developed countries such as the United States and United Kingdom and their pharmaceutical companies – Pfizer, Moderna, and Astra Zeneca – have already announced their success with the vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic, which are now awaiting final stage trials.
Pimentel-Gana emphasized that the preservation of life is a fundamental human right, so global leaders must address the distribution with “ethical solutions” that reflect the principles of human rights, universality, and equity.
She said that every human being must be given the vaccine regardless of their race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.
While developed countries will undoubtedly prioritize vaccinating their citizens, the CHR said that they should also keep in mind that less-developed countries also need their help.
 On Friday, Philippine Ambassador to the US Babes Romualdez said two more US biotech companies have expressed willingness to supply the Philippines with COVID-19 vaccines. These are Moderna and Arcturus. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

While many people are skeptical about the COVID vaccine, nurse Riza Raquion believes that it is the only way to end the pandemic and slowly put people’s lives back to normal.
Richie Gil, a critical care nurse who is married to a nurse, said: ‘I have long been waiting for this moment to come after enduring 10 months of risking our lives being exposed to COVID-19 patients.
Gil and his wife availed of the early vaccination to protect their three young children and aging in-laws. Leo Quijano, a nurse in the UK, who received the injection a day after it was rolled out by the UK government, said: ‘Being a victim of COVID-19 myself, I did not hesitate. I am positive about the vaccine which has shown 95 percent efficacy in the study and that is really good.”In the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic are brave Filipino healthcare workers, many of them working in critical hospital wards abroad.They are witnessing at first hand the viciousness of the coronavirus disease that has already claimed the lives of nearly 1.7 million people and infected more than 76.1 million others worldwide.
Just as the United Kingdom and the United States recently rolled out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use to address their spiraling cases, several Filipino healthcare workers in both countries volunteered to get the first dose of the vaccine amid skepticism on its efficacy and possible side effects. RIZA RAQUION, Registered Nurse, Chicago
“It’s my duty as a health care provider to be a good example to protect my patient, my family and my community,” said the 53-year-old Riza Raquion. She was administered with the vaccine on December 18 at the Amita Health Resurrection Medical Center in Chicago where she works as a registered nurse.
When Raquion heard the news from the hospital that they will begin to roll out the vaccine, “I immediately prepared myself mentally,” she told the Manila Bulletin in an online interview on Sunday.

“When you work at the hospital bedside as a nurse, you will see the struggle. You will see how they (COVID patients) cope to get better. It’s very hard and I’ve seen them. It breaks my heart to take care of these patients and I don’t want them to die in front of me again. I’ve witnessed it and it’s so depressing. You’ll cry when you see them intubated, when you see them transferred to the ICU,” said Raquion, a mother of two boys.Even her 20-year-old son was not spared from the scourge of the pandemic. Raquion said her son is now under home isolation after contracting the virus only last Friday, presumably after going out to help a friend to do an errand. She was thankful that he only manifested “mild symptoms” of fever and headache for two days, while his temperature and oxygen saturation are now back to the normal level. She compared her COVID vaccination to flu shots “which I think hurts more.” After the injection, Raquion only noticed “soreness” in her left arm that easily went away the following day. “Now I’m feeling okay, no body ache, no other symptoms, no headache, no nausea, no vomiting.”

“Don’t be afraid to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This is the only way to protect your loved ones, the community, and yourself to fight the virus if you’re exposed,” Raquion said, even as she warned that even with the vaccine, people should not let their guard down by continuing to observe basic health protocols such as the wearing of mask and face shield in public, social distancing, and proper handwashing.

A native of Dueñas, Iloilo, Gil migrated to the Windy City in 1994 and married Jeannie Segovia, a first-generation Filipina who is also a nurse at Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago. Since he is currently assigned at the Peri-operative services and Post Anesthesia Care Unit, considered as one of the COVID-19 battlefronts for medical frontliners, Gil was among those prioritized to receive the first wave of the vaccines allotted for the State of Illinois and City of Chicago.“I have long been waiting for this moment to come after enduring 10 months of risking our lives being exposed to COVID-19 patients. The daily uncertainty made me and my wife, who is also a nurse, accept the fact that it is just a matter of time before we get infected,” Gil said in an online interview.
He admitted that several friends, co-workers, and family members were among the close to 300,000 American lives lost since the pandemic hit the United States early this year.Gil said he and his wife were compelled to avail of an early vaccination to protect their three young children and his aging in-laws. Gil received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on December 17, 2020, ahead of his wife who is just waiting for her turn at the medical facility where she is working.
Even before the approval for emergency use was announced, Gil said most of the hospitals in the US had prepared and created a system leading to the vaccination, along with information about the selected vaccine to be administered.Despite that, Gil said not all of his co-workers are eager to be included in the first wave.“There was skepticism about the unknown side effects that this novel vaccine might cause where some are just waiting until others were vaccinated first… Even some Filipino nurses I know declined to take the first shot,” he added.
Gil maintained that he was not nervous at all the moment the needle of the vaccine injection pierced through his skin.“I stopped momentarily to remember those who didn’t live to see the glory of that moment. I remembered all those who fell victim to this pandemic and the agony their family had to endure. I was full of hope the souls of our loved ones find solace and consolation that their death and their memory strengthened the resolve to produce this vaccine that will provide protection and eventually bring healing to humanity,” he said. LEO QUIJANO, Nurse, England
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe in May this year, Leo Quijano, a Filipino nurse working in one of the major hospitals in Brighton, England, had tested positive for COVID-19. Quijano surmised she contracted the virus from one of the patients. Two days later, the same patient died due to COVID-19 infections.Filipino Nurse Leo Quijano receives the first dose of the Pfizer-made vaccine at a hospital in the City of Brighton in England on December 9, 2020. She was one of the first Filipino health care workers in the world to get the vaccine out of the clinical trial phase.It was also about that period when Quijano began experiencing COVID-like symptoms such as fatigue, dehydration, and off and on fever.Quijano went into isolation for seven days and returned to work for three consecutive days. On the third day, Quijano decided to go home early after feeling too tired and exhausted and then again went into isolation for another two weeks until the situation got worst.On June 1, Quijano’s COVID test yielded positive and she was hastily placed at the hospital’s Red Zone, the dreaded isolation area for COVID-19 patients. While Quijano was lucky enough to have recovered from the bout with COVID-19, she was not able to work for two straight months.
When the UK government announced the rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Quijano was among the first Filipino health workers in the UK to avail of the vaccine.“Being a victim of COVID-19 myself, I did not hesitate. I am positive about the vaccine which has shown 95 percent efficacy in the study and that is really good,” said Quijano who received the injection on December 8, a day after it was rolled out by the UK government.Despite the staggering number of COVID-19 cases in the UK, Quijano admits that some of her colleagues are still hesitant to be vaccinated.
“Some are even joking that they want to see first what will happen to me in the next few months. All I can say is that we’ve been waiting for this and it’s already here,” she said.
Quijano observed that the vaccination in the UK seems to be gaining ground, citing the sudden increase in the number of healthcare workers and elderly folks accessing the online booking platform.
“I noticed that the schedule is already fully-booked in the next few weeks,” Quijano said.Nurse Leo Quijano, one of the first Filipino health care workers to receive the Pfizer vaccine, is shown at work in a hospital in Brighton, England
In a recent webinar hosted by the Quezon City government, Quijano assured the participants that she is more than happy to share his experience with the Filipino people and help in the advocacy for the use of a safe and reliable vaccine in the Philippines.
“Huwag po kayo matakot (Don’t be afraid). I hope it will be made available in the Philippines soon so that you will be protected and we can all normally function just like before the pandemic. But still, the key is prevention, we still need to observe the basic health protocols,” Quijano said. The Pfizer-BioNTech product, like other vaccines, will help the body to create the antibodies that destroy SARS-CoV2, the respiratory virus that causes COVID-19. This type of vaccine is made from a special RNA vaccine where one has to have two injections separated by three weeks to one month apart, with 95 percent effectiveness. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

TACLOBAN CITY – The provincial government of Eastern Visayas, and the city of Tacloban have set aside substantial amounts to purchase coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines for their citizens.
Eastern Samar Governor Ben Evardone told reporters that his province will be allocating P500 million to buy the COVID-19 vaccines.
“We are preparing about P500 million for the vaccines, medicines, and other items to make sure that our people are protected from this virus,” he said.
He added that this would ensure that people in his province, from the urban areas down to the rural or hinterland areas, will have access to the vaccines.
The governor clarified that vaccination will be on voluntary basis, but all those willing to be immunized will be accommodated.
“But I would like to continue to appeal to our people to strictly observe health protocols before and after vaccinations,” Evardone said.

But she said she will not comment on the recent issue among Sen. Panfilo Lacson, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manual Romualdez, and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
“I do not like to blame anyone because I don’t know the whole story. There are many sides of the coin,” Robredo said during her weekly radio show, but added that she has heard Duque and Secretary Carlito Galvez, the country’s COVID-19 vaccine czar, denying that there was a failure to procure vaccines from Pfizer as early as January.Locsin had earlier said that somebody “dropped the ball” on the negotiations with Pfizer that will supposedly deliver 10 million vaccines to the country by January. Lacson named Duque as the one who failed to secure the agreement.
Robredo lamented that the more people hear about the start of the inoculation of the vaccine in other countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, they fear that it may not take long to reach the Philippines.
Although the government has repeatedly said that vaccines will be available in March, some sectors and so-called studies are saying that the Philippines is farther down the list.
China-manufactured Sinovac is supposed to be available starting March.
“There is a lot of information coming in. But like what I always say, the government needs to have one voice because if there are different voices, that will add to the people’s fears,” Robredo said.“We need to exert effort to allay these fears and assure them (the people) that we will have access to the vaccines,” she added.
The Vice President noted the public fears around the security and efficacy of the Sinovac, and said that these concerns will affect the people’s perception of getting inoculated.
Robredo’s office has held briefings about the storage requirements of the vaccines, particularly the one by Pfizer which needs a -17 degrees Celsius deep-freezer storage.
The Philippines, she said, doesn’t have such a facility for still unknown reasons.“It is better if we can clarify these issues. Who’s telling the truth? There are many concerns about the vaccines, so this controversy will not help gain public trust,” Robredo added.
Meanwhile, Robredo also said Sunday that trolls have acknowledged her as the rightful winner for vice president in the 2016 national elections through the hashtag #NasaanAngBisePresidente (#Where is the Vice President).“First, they are acknowledging that I am the Vice President. They refer to me as the fake VP, so the hashtag ‘Nasaan Ang Bise Presidente’ (Where is the Vice President) with my picture on it shows that I am the Vice President they are looking for,” Robredo said during her weekly radio show.The hashtag trended on social media amid the flashfloods in Mindanao from tropical depression “Vicky.” #NasaanAngBisePresidente was seemingly the trolls’ answer to the hashtag #NasaanAngPresidente that went viral during last month’s typhoons.
Robredo said she is ready to help victims of Vicky. “Andito po ako. Kanina pa kami nagco-coordinate sa areas na apektado (I’m here. We have been coordinating with the affected areas).” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Concepcion said Ayala Corp. confirmed 400,000 doses of vaccines, along with other companies such as Palawan Pawnshop which ordered 100,000 doses, Okada Manila – 40,000 doses, Uratex Philippines – 21,000 doses, Century Pacific Food – 20,000 doses, Unioil Petroleum Philippines Inc. – 20,000 doses, Golden Arches Development Corp. – 15,000 doses, and Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines Inc. – 10,000 doses. Each dose is still at its base cost of $5 (about ₱250).
He said meetings with the European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, the British Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, the Entrepreneurs Organization, the Philippine Franchise Association, the Association of the Filipino Franchisers Inc., Philippine Ecozone Developers, Philippine Hotel Associations Inc., the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc., and George Barcelon of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry took place immediately after the purchase for the second batch of AstraZeneca vaccines was announced.“When they told me that, the number of calls and inquiries from the private sector were increasing. Although we expected it somehow, we were happy that more and more private sector partners are now taking their part in this initiative – ending the war against COVID-19. This only means that the business community is very serious in ensuring that our economy will remain open while slowly ending this war,” Concepcion stated, with more than 200 companies expressing their pledge and interest, and still counting.
Recognizing the “bayanihan” spiritbeing created among the community, Concepcion extended his reach to help more businesses acquire their share of the vaccines in “A Dose of Hope.”
Various business entities like microfinance institutions (MFIs) have been in contact with Go Negosyo and Concepcion.Allan Robert Sicat, executive director of the Microfinance Council of the Philippines Inc., has been connecting these networks of microfinance institutions to Go Negosyo and Concepcion.Dr. Jaime Aristotle Alip, founder and managing director of The Center for Agriculture and Rural Development Mutually Reinforcing Institutions, is one key advocate that is interested in the project.Leading a group of companies composed of a foundation, a bank, micro insurance, a development institute, and a business development service, Alip’s conglomerate is a critical source of assistance for MSMEs.
Other advocates that expressed their interest in joining this cause are Fr. Jovic Lobrigo of Sedp Simbag sa Pag-asenso Inc. (SEDP Simbag) and Eduardo Jimenez of Kabalikat para sa Maunlad na Buhay Inc. (KMBI Inc).Concepcion, recently metthe Philippine Retailers Association headed by Rosemarie Ong, Senior Executive Vice President and COO of Wilcon Depot.“I shared with them that it’s important to vaccinate all the frontliners in the retail sector, supermarkets, department stores, and malls,” Concepcion said as a step in helping MSMEs bounce back.
“The more businesses involved in this project, the faster the ecosystem will be revived, thus, stimulating exchange. It is one answer to the question of how we get money flowing again – it will stop the bleeding,” he added.
“Two fronts kasi yan, both from the government side, they’re taking care of the public sector, kami naman sa private sector – teamwork kami. So, if we’re able to execute, mas madaling sagupain itong pandemya,” Concepcion said.
“With the government mainly ensuring the welfare of the country through enabling and keeping safe our health frontliners, this initiative, Concepcion said, will ensure the welfare of our country through enabling and boosting our economic frontliners. Sa kapasidad namin, tutulong din kami. If the private sector will not help, the economy will remain restricted.”“MSMEs are one of the greatly affected in this pandemic. Right now, as some of their businesses are closed, they don’t have a cash flow. So now, this is why we want to really help, I think the real solution here is control the situation and control the infection, get rid of the virus – and this is only possible through the vaccine,” Concepcion said.
“Many business organizations want to be in the second part, and this could be the last. Just look at it, the cost of testing using antigen is P500, RT-PCR, P2,500 and up. This is P500 for two doses, an offer from Astra from their zero profit program for 2021,”he said.
“This is the only way to accelerate our economic recovery and save lives.”

Switzerland on Saturday approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with immunisation set to start just after Christmas as the country battles rising coronavirus cases.
The Swissmedic regulatory authority said it had given the green light following a two-month rolling review.
Switzerland has been recording more than 4,000 new cases and 100 deaths every day. There have been a total of 400,000 infections and nearly 6,000 deaths since the pandemic began.“After a meticulous review of the available information, Swissmedic concluded that the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech is safe and that its benefit outweighs the risks,” Swissmedic said.
Health Minister Alain Berset added: “We can start vaccinating in the coming days.“Those who are particularly vulnerable will have priority,” he said, referring to the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.
These amount to some two million people in Switzerland, which has a population of 8.6 million.Produced by US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer and German biotechnology company BioNTech, the vaccine is based on a new technology that uses genetic material in the form of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid).
“The level of protection afforded seven days after the second injection is over 90 percent in adults,” Swissmedic said of the data it reviewed.
The regulator said the most frequently-documented side effects were “comparable with those after a flu vaccination”.
– Curbs as infections rise –The Swiss army will receive, store and distribute the vaccine doses, which must be kept at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit).
The army said it had verbal assurances from Pfizer-BioNTech that it will deliver nearly 107,000 doses in the coming days, then 250,000 per month from January.
Basel city said it was ready to start vaccinations on December 28.
Health minister Berset said the vaccine was not mandatory but was “strongly recommended” — and free of charge.
The announcement came a day after the Swiss government said bars and restaurants would once again be closed across the country from Tuesday for at least a month.“The number of infections is very high and is continuing to rise. Hospitals and healthcare workers have been under extreme pressure for weeks and the festive period increases the risk of an even more rapid rise in cases,” it said.
Achieving sufficient immunity will take up to a year, and six months even “in the best case”, said Virginie Masserey, the Swiss health ministry’s vaccine strategy chief.
“It depends on how quickly people want to get vaccinated,” she told a press conference.
Switzerland has secured around 15.8 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, in deals with three manufacturers.
It has signed contracts for around three million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, around 7.5 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine, and around 5.3 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Two doses are required per person for all the three vaccines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

With Europe and the United States already beginning to vaccinate citizens against the Covid-19 disease, there are fears some countries may be left behind.
Here is a snapshot of what vaccines are being preferred around the Middle East and North Africa, and which treatments are being used to help those infected by the novel coronavirus.
– Algeria –
TreatmentAlgeria opted early on to use hydroxychloroquine, along with antibiotics and cortisone treatments such as prednisolone or dexamethasone, and anti-coagulants, doctor Bekkat Berkani, a member of the national pandemic committee, told AFP.
There had been a campaign by labs to show that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine was “inefficient or risked even being dangerous,” he said. But he insisted about “two billion people” take it “prophylactically for anti-malarial purposes around the world”.
Vaccine
Algeria has not yet decided which vaccine to use. Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad has said his country will “acquire the vaccine which provides sure guarantees, therefore there is a need to avoid any haste or random decisions”.
– Bahrain –Treatment
Bahrain has been using hydroxychloroquine. The Bahrain News Agency quoted Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Khalifa, head of the national coronavirus taskforce, as saying the treatment had proved its effectiveness and alleviated symptoms.
Bahrain has also used plasma therapy to treat patients, repeatedly urging those who had recovered from the virus to donate blood.Vaccine
On December 13, Manama approved the use of the Chinese-made vaccine Sinopharm for frontline health workers, after already approving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, developed by US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.
– Egypt –
Treatment
Egyptian hospitals are using a variety of different methods, including azithromycin, paracetamol, cortisone and oral anticoagulants.
VaccineEgypt has received 100,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, but has not begun vaccinations yet, according to the health ministry. The finance ministry said this week another 20 million doses had been ordered, without giving further information.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said recently that Egyptians may have to wait until next July for a mass vaccination campaign to start.
– Iran –
TreatmentHealth Minister Saeed Namaki was quoted by official news agency IRNA as saying the country had used the anti-viral “remdesivir, which has had a relative impact on the disease”.
The medication is also being produced locally. IRNA reported the Islamic republic has started producing 70,000 vials of remdesivir in a plant opened in northern Saveh on December 15. The drug was originally developed to treat Ebola.
Vaccine
There has been no clear indication of which vaccine may be acquired by the sanctions-hit country. President Hassan Rouhani said in early December Iran wanted to buy a vaccine but “no bank will handle the transaction”.The health minister was quoted as saying Tehran had pre-ordered about 16.8 million doses via the World Health Organization’s vaccine project COVAX.
COVAX is a global collaboration involving over 180 countries working with vaccine manufacturers to ensure equitable distribution of the vaccines once approved.
Iran is also working on developing its own vaccine and human trials are expected to start soon. IRNA said this week Iran is discussing getting vaccines from three countries — China, Russia and India.
– Iraq –
Treatment
Iraqi hospitals are recommended to treat mild cases with an anti-viral drug favipiravir and plasma therapy if needed. The health ministry says severe cases should be treated primarily with remdesivir, as well as with plasma therapy and even the immunosuppressant tocilizumab.
While hydroxychloroquine does not feature among the ministry’s recommendations, Covid-19 patients told AFP they had been offered it.
VaccineIraqi health ministry spokesman Seif al-Badr told AFP authorities were still in talks with different companies, but no decision has been made yet.
“Iraq has joined the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and members will get a certain portion of them (the vaccines). We have been talking to companies day and night. We have been negotiating with Pfizer for months and we will choose a company soon,” Badr said.
Western officials in Iraq told AFP Washington was putting pressure on Baghdad to choose Pfizer-BioNTech over other options.The Geneva-based Gavi is a public-private partnership, which is working to help secure delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine for poorer countries.
– Israel –
Treatment
Dr Asher Salmon, head of the international relations department at the health ministry, told AFP Israel uses steroids and remdesivir, but it has refrained from using hydroxychloroquine.
Plasma is used in some cases, but there have only been “partial results”.
Vaccine
Israel has ordered 14 million doses of the vaccine — covering seven million people, as two doses are required per person for optimal protection — from Pfizer as well as US biotech firm Moderna.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first people in Israel to get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, as the country began its rollout on Saturday.
– Jordan –
Treatment
In severe and critical cases, treatments such as the steroids dexamethasone or hydrocortisone are used, as well as the immunosuppressant prednisone. Remdesivir or favipiravir, as well as plasma therapy, are also used.
Vaccine
Jordan has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, expected to be available in the country by February.
– Kuwait –
Treatment
Infectious disease specialist Mohammad Abul said Kuwait was using dexamethasone to treat serious cases, as well as remdesivir.
Blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients was initially used, but the method was stopped because it was not proven to be very effective, he said.
Vaccine
Kuwait this month approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, launching a website for people to sign up to be inoculated. Reports said it was due to arrive later this month.
– Lebanon –
Treatment
Lebanon is using mostly dexamethasone as it is “cheap, available in the market and studies show it is efficient”, said Firass Abiad, head of the government-run Rafic Hariri Hospital.Plasma is also used, but to a lesser extent, as “studies revealed it is only efficient in the early stages of the virus”. As for chloroquine and remdesivir, very few hospitals still use them, he added.
Vaccine
Lebanon signed an $18 million deal with Pfizer-BioNTech for the delivery of 1.5 million vaccines expected in February, according to the health minister’s adviser, Mahmoud Zalzali.
Under the agreement, vaccines will also be delivered for free to refugees. Although the exact number is not yet known, there are estimates it may amount to about 700,000 vaccines.
Lebanon has also joined COVAX. According to Zalzali, the agreement stipulates the delivery of 2.2 million vaccines to Lebanon, but they will not be delivered before the third quarter of 2021.
– Libya –
Treatment
Blood plasma has been one of the main methods of treating Covid-19 patients in the North African country.
Vaccine
Libya has bought 2.7 million doses of the British-Swedish AstraZeneca vaccine for about $10 million, Badreddine al-Najjar, head of the country’s national disease control centre, told AFP.
That would allow it to vaccinate about 1.25 million people, about 20 percent of the population. It is hoped supplies will begin arriving in March.
“This was a purely technical choice for Libya. It is stored and transported at temperatures between two to eight degrees Celsius, which makes it suitable for the weather conditions in Libya,” he said.– Morocco –
Treatment
Since March, Morocco has opted to use hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients as well as doses of azithromycin, an antibiotic used against bacterial infections, including pneumonia.
Health Minister Khaled Ait Taleb defended the use of the controversial hydroxychloroquine, saying results had shown “it had a certain efficacity in preventing the virus from the entering the cells”.
“This allowed us right from the start of the infection, and not in serious cases, to decrease the viral load and reduce contagion,” he said, quoted by the website Media24.
Vaccine
Vaccinations have not yet started in Morocco, but authorities say 10 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine should arrive by the end of the year.– Oman –
Treatment
Some private hospitals are using plasma therapy to treat Covid-19 patients, which had shown some “positive results”, according to a statement by Burjeel Hospital Al Khuwair earlier this year.
Vaccine
Oman announced this month that it had approved and will import the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use on those older than 16.
– Qatar –
Treatment
Hospitals are using a number of different treatments tailored to each patient. Limited use is made of plasma treatments.
Vaccine
Qatar has contracts with several of the pharmaceutical companies with promising vaccines, with Pfizer-BioNTech likely to be the first to become available, AFP understands.
The first jabs could become available by the end of the year. It has also entered into procurement agreements with other vaccine suppliers, including the US company Moderna.
– Saudi Arabia –
Treatment
Saudi health authorities have prescribed a cocktail of drugs, including hydroxychloroquine for moderate or mild cases. Dexamethasone has been prescribed for patients requiring ventilation.
Remdesivir was initially recommended for very critical patients, but state media said the drug has “little or no effect” on severe cases.
Vaccine
Saudi Arabia, which has recorded the highest number of deaths among the Gulf Arab states, has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after successful trials. Health Minister Tawfiq Al-Rabiah was among the first to take the jab on Thursday. – Sudan –
Treatment
Various treatments have been used on Covid-19 patients, including antibiotics such as azithromycin, amoxicillin and doxycycline, as well as steroids like dexamethasone and anticoagulants.
Vaccine
The health ministry has announced that 8.4 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will be provided for specific groups, mainly the vulnerable and frontline workers, with the first distribution planned in the first quarter of 2021. But no further details were given.
– Syria –
Treatment
For the most serious cases, “physicians are using dexamethasone injection to improve patients’ survival and reduce the hospitalisation period”, as well as using oxygen and ventilators, the WHO regional office in Syria told AFP.
The Syrian health ministry has said the government treatment protocol was based on three main medicines: chloroquine (Syria has around six laboratories that produce it), azithromycin and interferon, used to treat viruses and certain cancers.
Vaccine
“There are no vaccines determined yet,” the WHO regional office in Syria said. But the WHO, together with the UN children’s agency UNICEF and Gavi, were supporting Syria to acquire “vaccines to cover at least three percent of the population to start with and aiming for 20 percent in 2021”.
– Tunisia –
Treatment
Several treatments are being used, including azithromycin, paracetamol and anticoagulants, as well as oxygen.
Vaccine
Tunisia has contracted to buy vaccines from Pfizer and is working through the COVAX initiative. One million people will be vaccinated in the first stage, said Hechmi Louzir, director of the Tunis Pasteur Institute. The vaccine should arrive in the second quarter of 2021, and health services are preparing a vaccination campaign.
– United Arab Emirates –
Treatment
The UAE has used hydroxychloroquine to treat simple and moderate cases, but is continually monitoring its use. The Abu Dhabi Health Services said in June it had also used blood plasma on at least 240 patients.
Vaccine
The rollout of the Sinopharm vaccine has already begun, with UAE authorities saying it was 86 percent effective. The health ministry said there were “no serious safety concerns”.
Two vaccines have undergone third-phase trials in the UAE, the Sinopharm project and Russia’s Sputnik V.
– Yemen –
Treatment
The pandemic has exacerbated the already dire humanitarian situation in Yemen, where the health system has all but collapsed amid the ongoing civil war.
A string of field clinics run by international agencies have opened in some places, but according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA in October, the response is focused on testing, surveillance and case management.

The early procurement of COVID-19 vaccines amid renewed government efforts to procure them from the United States is the Christmas wish of Sen. Panfilo M. Lacson.
Senator Panfilo M. Lacson (SENATE OF THE PHILIPPINES / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
Lacson also said there should be no room for incompetence and ineptitude, especially on the part of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, after the events last week.
“My Christmas wish is simple. I hope we Filipinos survive this pandemic, and we get the needed vaccines soonest,” Lacson said in an interview on DWIZ radio.But he added the Cabinet, including vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., should help Duque not by defending him in media but by getting his job done.
He said that if there was something good that came out of Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.’s tweet about someone ‘’dropping the ball’’ during the initial efforts to get vaccines, it was that the attention of those concerned had been called.
Earlier, Lacson bared it was Duque who “dropped the ball” in initial talks for vaccines by not acting quickly in signing a confidentiality disclosure agreement (CDA) that would seal the deal.
Lacson noted Locsin and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke Friday night for the Philippines to procure COVID vaccines, even if it is just a fraction of the 10 million doses initially discussed.“This time, I expect Secretary Duque to be alert, and I expect the Cabinet members to help him move faster instead of defending him through statements to the media,’’ he said.
“Tulungan na lang, huwag tulungan magpaliwanag sa media. Tulungan na lang magtrabaho,” he added.
(Just help him. Don’t explain your side through the media. Help do his work)He noted Duque had asked Galvez and other Cabinet members to defend him in the media, noting Duque was “practically frantic” in doing so.“Please don’t defend the indefensible,” Lacson advised Galvez, noting no less than President Duterte had told Duque to explain himself.“This is also not an issue of a ‘mission impossible’ of getting the vaccines by January. The issue is Duque’s negligence that more efficient bureaucracies like Singapore getting the vaccines ahead of us,” he added.As for Duque’s claim that he erred on the side of caution in signing the CDA late, Lacson said: “Caution, my foot. 118 days to sign a simple CDA, between June and October?” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

No bus was missed and nobody dropped the ball in the negotiations for COVID-19 vaccines from US biopharmaceutical giant Pfizer.
Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 and the designated vaccine czar, stressed this Saturday as he finally addressed the controversies hounding the allegedly botched deal by the government with Pfizer.
Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 (NTF AGAINST COVID-19 / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
In a “Laging Handa” press briefing, Galvez clarified that the negotiation by the government with Pfizer for the possible supply of COVID-19 vaccines “is still ongoing” and the signing of an agreement may happen this month or by January.“Nasa advance (stage) na tayo sa Pfizer so hinihintay na lang natin ang validation and coordination from Pfizer headquarters. Once magkaroon na ng talagang… kung ilan ang i-allocate sa atin, magkakaroon na ng pirmahan. Hopefully ang pinaka-earliest ay within this month or maybe kung may delay ‘yung allocation it will be first week of January (We are already in the advanced stage of negotiation with Pfizer so we are just waiting for the validation and coordination by the government with Pfizer headquarters. Once we already determine how many (doses) they are willing to allocate to us, there will be a signing of an agreement. Hopefully, the earliest is within this month or first week of January (2021) if there is a delay in the allocation),” he said.
The controversy stemmed from the revelation of Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.last week that the plan to secure Pfizer’s vaccine by January was foiled after “someone dropped the ball” during the negotiations. He did not drop any names.
But Sen. Panfilo Lacson bared that Locsin was referring to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III after Duquesupposedly failed to submit “on time” a confidentiality disclosure agreement (CDA) to Pfizer.The CDA will ensure that some critical information about Pfizer’s vaccines will not be divulged to the public while certain evaluation processes are still ongoing.Galvez defended Duque from criticisms that his supposed negligence led to the fallout of the government and Pfizer’s negotiations which, according to the vaccine czar, started in the middle part of the year.
Galvez bared that the government has been talking with Pfizer as early as August or September for the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines but there were some “roadblocks” that were encountered by both parties.
Among the roadblocks were the lack of data about the efficacy of Pfizer at the time and the need to store the vaccine in extremely cold temperatures.“Noong panahon na iyon, maraming uncertainties kasi ‘yung platform ng Pfizer ay hindi pa ginagamit sa mga vaccine. ‘Yun ang block at napakataas ng requirement sa logistics (During that time, there were a lot of uncertainties because the platform of Pfizer was not yet used in the vaccines. That was the roadblock and the high requirements in the logistics),” Galvez said.
“‘Yung nangyayaring negotiation sa Pfizer ay ongoing po at hindi po tayo bumitaw. Hindi po natin nabitawan ang bola kundi ipinasa lang sa akin (The negotiation with Pfizer is currently ongoing and we did not let go. Nobody dropped the ball but it was passed to me),” he added.
Galvez urged all stakeholders to stop making “unfounded accusations and unnecessary noise” which may derail the government from pursuing its goal of securing a safe and effective vaccine.
“The ball is being passed not because there are those who are abrogating responsibility but because we want it to reach the goal – to close deals and obtain vaccines for all Filipinos so that we can implement our national vaccination program at the most appropriate time,” he said.
Pfizer is at the forefront of the vaccine race as it reported that its candidate vaccine yielded 95-percent efficacy in its Phase 3 trials. The United States government already issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Pfizer to allow its vaccine to be used for public consumption.Galvez assured that the government is “determined” to acquire safe and effective vaccines for all Filipinos “regardless of brand or their country of origin.”The government is planning to inoculate 60 to 70 percent of the total population, or about 70 million Filipinos, to achieve herd immunity and as part of the National Vaccine Roadmap to eradicate the threat of COVID-19.
“With this as our guiding principle, it is our duty as public servants to carefully study and evaluate all documents relative to the procurement and acquisition of candidate vaccines, especially when the public health and safety are at stake. As we take responsibility for our actions, we cannot afford to engage in finger-pointing or buck-passing at this crucial stage. These kinds of discussions are unproductive and will only distract us from carrying out our crucial mandate,” he said.
Galvez said all the decisions and actions that the government has made were done “in accordance with the careful process of scientific evaluation and selection” of the Vaccine Expert Panel (VEP), which evaluates the vaccine candidates that want to enter the country.
“The process of selection is based on safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, the track record of the vaccine maker, complexity of handling and logistics, after-sales and life cycle services, production capacity and early delivery, and long-term commitment,” he said. “Let me reiterate, no ‘bus’ was missed or no ‘ball’ was dropped because we are focused on our main goal and that is to secure an equitable share of the vaccines,” he added.

Several senior US officials including Vice President Mike Pence got early Covid-19 vaccinations Friday, contrasting with Europe, where two leaders were quarantining after testing positive and EU regulators have yet to approve a vaccine.

Pence’s public inoculation against the coronavirus was the most high-profile attempt yet at persuading vaccine-skeptic Americans to join a massive national effort to halt a pandemic that has killed at least 1.66 million people and infected more than 74 million worldwide.
Also getting their shots were House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office on January 20, announced he would take the vaccine, also in public, on Monday.
Yet in hard-hit Europe, unease mounted after Slovakia’s 47-year-old Prime Minister Igor Matovic tested positive Friday for Covid-19 a week after attending a European Union summit in Brussels.
The summit is believed to be where French President Emmanuel Macron caught the virus — the announcement of his diagnosis a day earlier led a host of European leaders and top French officials to rush into self-isolation.
Macron acknowledged Friday he had been “slowed down” by his infection, but insisted he was doing well and still actively involved in “priority” government business including Brexit trade talks.US President Donald Trump, who has been a longtime skeptic about the seriousness of the pandemic, wished Macron “a speedy recovery,” the White House said.
Elsewhere, world leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are also pledging to get public injections in order to boost confidence in the vaccines.
The first wave of vaccinations in the United States, where more than 310,000 Americans have died, are using the Pfizer/BioNTech drug.Another vaccine, made by Moderna, is now expected to become the second shot allowed in a Western country after a panel of US experts recommended emergency use approval.
Trump was notably absent from Pence’s vaccination event.
But he has been eager to take credit for record-fast vaccine breakthroughs, and he sparked confusion Friday when he jumped the gun to declare Moderna approved, ahead of a final verdict from the Food and Drug Administration.
“Distribution to start immediately,” Trump tweeted.– Two billion doses –
The European Union faces pressure to approve vaccines after Britain and the United States have already administered tens of thousands of shots, while China and Russia have launched efforts with domestically produced vaccines. 
The bloc intends to begin its inoculations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine before the end of the year, with some countries naming December 27 as a start date.
Poorer countries also got a boost Friday when the World Health Organization and partners said vaccines would be distributed early next year to the 190 countries in its Covax initiative, a pooling effort formed to ensure an equitable distribution.“The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference.
Two billion doses have been secured from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, though none of their candidates have so far received authorization for use.
In China, at least one million people have already received shots from homegrown vaccine candidates approved for emergency use.After focusing on priority groups, the country plans to widen its program to the public in southwestern Sichuan province early next year, health officials said.
China’s five coronavirus vaccines are in the final stages of development, but none has received official approval.
– Europe reels, new variant in SAfrica–
Even as vaccine plans advance, the virus continues to rage.
In the United States alone, more than 3,000 people are dying a day, and infections keep hitting senior officials.
On Friday, the iconic Washington Monument was temporarily closed after Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who has reportedly been giving private tours to his associates, tested positive.
Europe is still in the throes of a winter surge that has caused almost 37,000 deaths over the past seven days, the highest weekly toll since the start of the pandemic.
Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, on Friday announced a new month-long lockdown starting December 26 in response to a wave of infections.
And Sweden announced a U-turn on face masks, recommending that they be worn on public transport at peak times, having previously resisted their use in the fight against Covid-19 except in health care.
In South Africa, Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize signaled the detection of a severe coronavirus variant that could explain the rapid spread of a second wave of cases.
Latin America is also seeing hard days, with Brazil and Mexico logging the highest number of new deaths after the United States.
Mexico City’s mayor announced that the capital and neighboring state would suspend almost all activities from this weekend as virus cases rise — allowing only such essentials as the sale of food, energy, transport, manufacturing and financial services.
But in Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro — who has systemically downplayed the coronavirus — continued to undermine the country’s own immunization campaign, this time with the outlandish suggestion that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could turn people into “crocodiles” or “bearded ladies.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON — The United States on Friday authorized Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, as the country grapples with a brutal winter surge that is killing over 2,500 people a day.

The US is the first nation to authorize the two-dose regimen, now the second vaccine to be deployed in a Western country after one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.
“With the availability of two vaccines now for the prevention of Covid-19, the FDA has taken another crucial step in the fight against this global pandemic,” Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief Stephen Hahn said.President Donald Trump – who has frequently taken credit for the fast pace of vaccine development – tweeted: “Congratulations, the Moderna vaccine is now available!”
Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in November’s presidential elections and is due to take office in January, hailed the news as “another milestone” in the fight against the virus.
But he also warned of “the immense challenges ahead, including scaling up manufacturing, distribution, and the monumental task of vaccinating hundreds of millions of Americans.”
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved by Britain on December 2, followed by several other countries including the US last week. Less-vetted shots have also been rolled out in China and Russia.The United States alone has seen more than 310,000 people die from coronavirus infections and is in the midst of a brutal winter surge, with nearly 115,000 people hospitalized, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
Cutting-edge technology
Moderna has several other drugs under development, but has never before seen any authorized.
The decade-old, Massachusetts-based biotech company received $2.5 billion in federal funding for its efforts and co-developed the vaccine with scientists at the National Institutes of Health.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are based on cutting-edge mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology, and both have been shown to be highly effective, protecting about 95 percent of people against Covid-19 compared to a placebo.
They have also been found to have no serious safety issues in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people each.
The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes in the same arm as the injection, nausea and vomiting, and fever.
But there have now been a handful of people around the world who developed significant allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, and the FDA has said it will remain vigilant in its monitoring.
Both vaccines come with warnings for people who have histories of allergic reactions to their ingredients.
FDA scientist Peter Marks told reporters that the total number of cases of allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine across the United States was now around five.
He said investigations were underway, and suggested the culprit might be an ingredient called polyethylene glycol, which is in both vaccines.
The FDA will also be on the lookout to see whether both vaccines may in extremely rare cases be linked to Bell’s palsy, a temporary facial paralysis condition, a handful of cases of which emerged during clinical trials.
Placebo dilemma
Both of the vaccines work by giving human cells the instructions to make a surface protein of the coronavirus, which simulates an infection and trains the immune system for when it encounters the real virus.
They each differ in the formulation of the fatty particles used to deliver the mRNA, which allows Moderna’s vaccine to be kept in long term storage at -20 degrees Celsius, unlike Pfizer’s, which must be stored at -90 degrees Celsius.
Moderna carried out a clinical trial of more than 30,000 people, roughly half of whom were given the product and the other half a placebo, with neither recipients nor their health care providers knowing who was in each group.It has proposed to “unblind” the whole study and offer placebo recipients the vaccine, a plan criticized by some experts who say scientists will be deprived of valuable data, and some people will end up getting the vaccine ahead of others in their priority group.
The US has paid for 200 million doses, enough to vaccinate 100 million people.
Moderna proposes to ship 20 million this month and 80 million more in the first quarter of 2021, with the remaining 100 million in the second quarter.
US leaders line up for vaccines
Several senior US officials including Vice President Mike Pence got early COVID-19 vaccinations Friday, contrasting with Europe, where two leaders were quarantining after testing positive and EU regulators have yet to approve a vaccine.

The UN health agency, the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced they had now secured nearly two billion doses of various vaccine candidates still under development on behalf of the 190 countries taking part in Covax.
“The arrangements announced today will enable all participating economies to have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021,” the statement said.They stressed though that the deliveries remained “contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries’ readiness for delivery.”
The vaccine developers that have so far committed hundreds of millions of doses each are: AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK. None of these have so far received authorization for use.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed the news, telling a virtual press conference that “the light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter.”
CEPI chief Richard Hatchett agreed, saying massive research and development efforts were paying off.“We now have safe and effective vaccines that can protect against COVID-19 and a clear pathway to securing two billion doses for the populations at greatest risk all around the world,” he said.
Gavi chief Seth Berkley meanwhile celebrated the “unprecedented speed and scale” of the project.
“Securing access to doses of a new vaccine for both higher-income and lower-income countries, at roughly the same time and during a pandemic, is a feat the world has never achieved before,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

US Vice President Mike Pence received a Covid-19 vaccine live on television Friday in a public display designed to boost national confidence in the drug, while President-elect Joe Biden is set to receive his shot on Monday.
US Vice President Mike Pence receives the COVID-19 vaccine in Washington — in public — on December 18, 2020
“Building confidence in the vaccine is what brings us here this morning,” Pence said after being injected, quipping: “I didn’t feel a thing.”
Pence, his wife Karen and the nation’s lead public health official, Surgeon General Jerome Adams, were all given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the annex to the White House.Signalling the importance given to the event, top infectious disease official Anthony Fauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Robert Redfield were also in the room.
Notably absent was President Donald Trump himself.The Republican has sent mixed messages about the seriousness of Covid-19 throughout the crisis, even as the US death toll topped 300,000 this month.
However, he has been keen to take credit for the historic speed of vaccine development.
Early Friday, he tweeted that a second drug, made by Moderna, had been “overwhelmingly approved” and that distribution would “start immediately.”
This sparked confusion. An advisory panel recommended emergency use approval for Moderna’s vaccine on Thursday, but the Food and Drug Administration was not expected to give the green light allowing distribution until later Friday.
Trump has made clear he is not planning to take the vaccine imminently, citing the belief that his recovery from a brief but severe bout of Covid has given him immunity.“He will receive the vaccine as soon as his medical team determines it’s best. But his priority is frontline workers, those in long-term care facilities,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said.
At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were given the vaccine on Friday.
Pelosi cited “confidence in science” as she received the injection at the US Capitol, adding that mask wearing and social distancing should be continued as the vaccine is distributed.
For his part, McConnell said: “Vaccines are how we beat this virus.”
On Thursday, the congressional attending physician Brian Monahan sent an “unequivocal” message to all members urging them to take the vaccine.“The benefit far exceeds any small risk,” he wrote.
– Fighting ‘misinformation’ –
Biden, eager to build Americans’ confidence in the vaccines, will meanwhile receive his first dose at a Delaware facility Monday one month before he takes office.
“He will be doing it in public, which is important to us, as he’s stated many times, to send a clear message to the public that it’s safe,” Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.
Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be vaccinated the following week.
Large numbers of Americans subscribe to the anti-vaccination movement and hostility to the Covid-19 vaccines in particular has been stirred by right-wing media personalities and conspiracy theorists.
“It feels false because it is, it’s too slick,” Fox News host Tucker Carlson told viewers Thursday.
There is also a focus of mistrust among African Americans, a group that Adams, who is Black, addressed after he got his dose.
Americans should not “let misinformation and mistrust cause you to make a decision that is bad for your health,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sen. Francis Pangilinan said Friday that the government will not have a problem with the availability of funds in procuring COVID-19 vaccines.

However, Pangilinan warned that the “slow” bureaucratic process could derail the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program since he believes that the country could even shore up additional funds to finance it.
“Hindi pera ang problema; bureakrasya ang problema (Money is not the problem; bureaucracy is the problem),” he said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel.Under the 2021 general appropriations, a total of P72.5 billion was appropriated for the purchase and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, P2.5 billion of which was allocated to the Department of Health, while P70 billion was lodged under the unprogrammed appropriations.
Another P10 billion has been set aside for vaccine purchase under the “Bayanihan to Recover as One” or Bayanihan 2 Act.
Besides the budget provided by Congress, Pangilinan recalled learning during their debates in the Senate that “we have anywhere between P800 billion to P900 billion in cash.”
He said billions of government funds remain unspent due to the slow release and utilization by agencies in the Executive department, prompting the lawmakers to extend the validity of the 2020 budget and the Bayanihan 2.
“Bilyong-bilyong halaga ng pera ang hindi nagagamit dahil mabagal, may burokrasya ng Executive department. Kung hindi natin in-extend, eh babalik sa national treasury, na kinakailangan nating gastusin dahil ‘yon ang hinahanap ng ating mga kababayan (Billions worth of money are not being spent because of the slow, excessive bureaucracy in the Executive department. If we did not extend it, the unused funds will be reverted to the national treasury, when we badly need to spend it because these are what our people need),” he said.“We are facing the worst economic crisis since World War 2, sabi ng mga (according to) experts. We are facing the worst crisis, siguro (maybe), in a hundred years, and therefore, hindi katanggap-tanggap na sa gitna ng ganitong mga pangangailangan na gastusin para makatulong ay mabagal at makupad ang pagrelease ng pondo (It is unacceptable that despite the need for such government spending to help our people, there is a slow release of funds),” he added.
“That’s why we’re pushing for better performance and clearer deliverables dito sa (here in the) COVID-19 vaccine rollout,” he said.
The Senate Committee of the Whole is set to conduct an inquiry into the government’s game plan in purchasing and distributing COVID-19 vaccines to the country’s population.“The Senate would like to step in and, try to, precisely, help put some direction and coordination in the vaccine rollout, which is critical,” Pangilinan said.Sen.

Aside from Pfizer, Romualdez said Moderna and Arcturus are “ready to supply” around four to 25 million of their respective COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines by the third quarter of 2021 should the government “find their proposals acceptable.”“We are hoping our government will consider the promising candidates of Moderna and Arcturus for inclusion in our country’s pool of anti-COVID vaccines,” Romualdez said.
Arcturus’ COVID candidate ARCT021 was developed with the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.ARCT021 uses a messenger RNA (mRNA) technology like the vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer.The vaccine is currently in its Phase I/II trial, according to a report by CNBC.Moderna, on the other hand, has been recommended for emergency approval in the United States by its panel of experts.
Romualdez said the country’s procurement of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer is still “in progress.”Unregistered vaccinesAs this developed, the Department of Health (DOH) warned the public Friday not to take COVID-19 vaccines that are unregistered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as it “could do more harm than good.”“We would like to warn and advise the public that when you use unregistered or unauthorized vaccines, we cannot guarantee its safety or if it will be efficacious… this may cause more harm than good,” said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.

A US panel of experts on Thursday voted to recommend emergency approval of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for six million doses to start shipping as soon as this weekend.
The Food and Drug Administration is now expected to imminently grant an emergency use authorization (EUA), which would make Moderna’s vaccine the second to be approved in a Western country.
This file photo taken on November 18, 2020 shows a bottle reading “Vaccine Covid-19” next to the Moderna biotech company logo.
(Photo by JOEL SAGET / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)
The panel voted 20 in favor, none against, with one abstention.They had been asked to answer the question: “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?”
Epidemiologist Arnold Monto, who chaired the live-streamed discussion, said nothing should be read into the fact that the vote was even more overwhelming than last week’s in favor of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
“Academics have a way of getting involved in details, and what we have done for the last eight or nine hours was to go over the details,” he said.
The meeting came as the number of deaths from the coronavirus quickly approaches 310,000 in the worst-hit country in the world, which this week began vaccinating health care workers and long-term care residents with the Pfizer vaccine.Both of these frontrunners are based on cutting-edge mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology, which had never been approved prior to the pandemic, and both are two-dose regimens.
Though the level of protection against Covid-19 for both is around 95 percent — far greater than experts had thought was possible — there have now been a handful of people around the world who developed significant allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.
The US, which has recorded more than 17 million cases of the virus, will probably become the first country to approve the Moderna vaccine.The small Massachusetts-based biotech firm teamed up with scientists from the US National Institutes of Health on the product and has received more than $2.5 billion from the US government for its efforts.
Protection against infection
A clinical trial of 30,400 people found it was 94.1 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 compared to a placebo, performing slightly better in younger adults compared to the elderly.
Jacqueline Miller, Moderna’s vice president of infectious diseases development, said Thursday that there was a strong suggestion the vaccine also protected most people against infection, which is important from a public health perspective as it would prevent onward transmission.
An FDA review of all available data found there were “no specific safety concerns identified.”
But on Thursday, FDA official Doran Fink said that should an EUA be granted, the agency would issue a beefed-up warning label regarding potential allergic reactions.This comes after two health care workers in Alaska had such reactions to the Pfizer vaccine, and one of them was hospitalized. Two health workers in the UK also had allergic reactions.
Placebo dilemma
Moderna was criticized by Stanford expert Steven Goodman because of its plans to offer the vaccine to participants in its trial who received the placebo, even before it would normally be available to their demographic group.
This would deprive the trial of a control group and reduce the quality of data that could be gleaned from it, plus set a bad precedent for future trials, he said.
But Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, defended the proposal.
“None of our trial participants would be ‘jumping the line’ ahead of others, because we have clinical trial supplies that in fact would expire and go to waste,” he said, adding many participants were at high-risk, and one person on the placebo group had died from severe Covid-19.
The most common side effects associated with the drug, called mRNA-1273, were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain and chills.
Few of these effects were classed as “severe.”
Allergic reactions occurred in 1.5 of the vaccinated population compared to 1.1 percent of the non-vaccinated, but none were classed as severe.
To date, there have been three reports of Bell’s palsy — a facial paralysis condition, most often temporary — in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group.
The FDA said there was insufficient information to determine that either vaccine was the cause but will continue monitoring. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The non-delivery of the 10 million doses of COVID-19vaccine from Pfizer because of the alleged failure of Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III to prepare the necessary requirement is another “reflection of incompetence”, Deputy Minority Leader and Bayan Muna partylist Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate said Thursday (Dec. 17).

The progressive lawmaker could not help, but inquire into reports alleging that Duque “dropped the ball” in the negotiation with the US company for the delivery of the coronavirus disease vaccines.
“‘Yung nagyaringkontrobersya dito sa acquisition , sa procurement ng vaccine ay emblematic doon sa pagmamaliit ng kasalukyang administrasyon sa problem ng COVID-19 pandemic,” Zarate told reporters in a virtual press conference.
(The controversy that is happening in the acquisition, in the procurement of vaccine is emblematic to the current administration’s act of belittling the problem of COVID-19 pandemic.)
He recalled that the DOH failed to declare a state of health emergency as early as February this year when there were already reported COVID-19 casualties.
Zarate, along with fellow Bayan Muna partylist Rep. Ferdinand Gaite said it seems that some camps are pushing for the procurement of the China’s coronavirus vaccines.
“Sinovac ba ang nagtutulak at makikinabanag sa usapang ito?,” Zarate said.In the same news forum, Gaite said he smelt something fishy in the procurement of the vaccines.
“Paulit-ulit si [President] Duterte na lalabanan nya ang corruption…pero, kahit dito sa vaccine procurement ay nangangamoy corruption,” he said.
(Duterte has been saying that he is against corruption…but, here in vaccine procurement, we smell corruption.)The Bayan Muna lawmaker observed that the Duterte government has apparent inkling to procure China’s vaccine, particularly Sinovac which is more expensive than other vaccines.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Thursday there was no promise from Pfizer that it will provide the Philippines with 10 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine next month.

In an interview with CNN Philippines, Duque said the US-based pharmaceutical company did not give a “definitive” number of vaccine supply for the Philippines in their previous discussions.
“Walang ganon (There was no promise). It was all indicative numbers there was no definitive supply because…in the production of these vaccines as we are talking…meron daw problema sa kanilang raw materials (they are having problems with regard to their raw materials)…there was nothing binding, nothing in our talks so this was all open-ended,” Duque said when asked if Pfizer ever promised to give the country 10 million doses of its vaccine by January.Earlier, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said he and Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez were able to secure 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine with the help of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo until “somebody dropped the ball.”
While Locsin did not disclose the name of the person he was referring to, Sen. Panfilo Lacson said it was Duque who “dropped the ball.”
Lacson, who had a phone conversation with Romualdez, said the Health Secretary failed to prepare the confidential disclosure agreement (CDA) which was one of the requirements for the procurement of the vaccines.
Duque defended himself from accusations that he did not act quick enough on the matter.“We go through a process and when you go through a process, you can’t just be hurrying up things just like that. You have to be prudent and cautious, especially because you are talking about a brand new, a novel vaccine,” Duque said.
“Not only is this a novel vaccine, but the technology that it is using, the mRNA platform is also new, never been tried or tested,” he added.
Duque said that is it his overriding principle as a medical professional and a physican to “air on the side of caution.”The Health Secretary also said that it was only on Aug. 11 when Pfizer sent a draft of the CDA, which was initially meant to be signed by Executive Secretary (ES) Salvador Medialdea representing the Office of the President (OP) on behalf of all the government agencies.
On Sept. 24, Duque said the Department of Health was advised by the OP that it will be the signatory to the CDA instead and requested the agency to hold a cooridnation meeting with Pfizer.
The following day, Sept. 25, Duque said the DoH had an alignment meeting with Pfizer on the matter, since Pfizer initially requested the OP to sign the CDA.
On Oct. 20. Duque said he signed the CDA.
When asked why it took him three weeks to sign the CDA, Duque said: “May mga provisions na di kami nag kakasundo (There were provisions which we did not agree upon).”“May alteration (There was alteration), the process of going back and forth until when I asked the Deputy Excutive Secreatry Michael Ong on the day I was going to sign it, sabi ko ito yung provision na medyo (I told him about the provision that) I have some discomfort, but he said it’s your judgment call,” Duque said.
“So I put my life in the line for this because I was thinking dapat siguro (maybe) after some time, baka naman itong bakuna na ito (maybe this vaccine) would prove effective…so that was my judgment call,” he added.
As for why the OES deicded to pass on the signing of the CDA to the DoH, Duque said: “The vaccine is health related it is directly aligned to the mandete of the DoH. That reason is well grounded.”
Duque reiterated that government needs to be cautious on procuring vaccines, especially new ones since it already had a “wrong expericence” about vaccines in the past.
“We don’t want a repeat of such already costly lessons we have expiernced in the past with some of the vaccines because this is new. I think the ES was well aware that we had to proceed with caution and really get a lot more independent information with regard to this new vaccine,” he said.
“We cannot just buy the vaccines like we’re buying a box of chocolate,” he said.
While CDA is technically not a contract for purchase, Duque said he has to examine the document with caution to make sure that it will not distract the government.
“I have to be very very cautious about what I am signing, ensuring that the government interest will be first and foremost protected, that there would be no onerous provision. I had to depend on my legal team to give me proper advice,” he said.
Duque said the government’s end goal is to provide the Filipino people with the “safest, most effective, most practicable vaccines.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Hungarian-born scientist Katalin Kariko’s obsession with researching a substance called mRNA to fight disease once cost her a faculty position at a prestigious US university, which dismissed the idea as a dead end.
Katalin Kariko spent much of the 1990s writing grant applications to fund her investigations into ‘messenger ribonucleic acid’ — genetic molecules that tell cells what proteins to make, essential to keeping our bodies alive and healthy
Now, her pioneering work — which paved the way for the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines — could be what saves the world from a 100-year pandemic.
“This is just kind of unbelievable,” she told AFP in a video call from her home in Philadelphia, adding she was unused to the attention after toiling for years in obscurity.It shows why “it’s important science should be supported on many levels.”
Kariko, 65, spent much of the 1990s writing grant applications to fund her investigations into “messenger ribonucleic acid” — genetic molecules that tell cells what proteins to make, essential to keeping our bodies alive and healthy.She believed mRNA held the key to treating diseases where having more of the right kind of protein can help — like repairing the brain after a stroke.
But the University of Pennsylvania, where Kariko was on track for a professorship, decided to pull the plug after the grant rejections piled up.
“I was up for promotion, and then they just demoted me and expected that I would walk out the door,” she said.Kariko didn’t yet have a green card and needed a job to renew her visa. She also knew she wouldn’t be able to put her daughter through college without the hefty staff discount.
She decided to persist as a lower-rung researcher, scraping by on a meager salary.It was a low point in her life and career, but “I just thought…you know, the (lab) bench is here, I just have to do better experiments,” she said.
The experience shaped her philosophy for dealing with adversity in every aspect of life.
“Think through and then at the end of it, you have to say ‘What can I do?’“Because then you don’t waste your life.”
The determination runs in the family — her daughter Susan Francia did go to Penn, where she earned a Master’s degree, and won gold medals with the US Olympic rowing team in 2008 and 2012.
– Twin breakthroughs –
Inside the body, mRNA delivers to cells the instructions stored in DNA, the molecules that carry all our genetic code.
By the late 1980s, much of the scientific community was focused on using DNA to deliver gene therapy, but Kariko believed that mRNA was also promising since most diseases are not hereditary and don’t need solutions that permanently alter our genetics.
First though, she had to overcome a major problem: in animal experiments, synthetic mRNA was causing a massive inflammatory response as the immune system sensed an invader and rushed to fight it.
Kariko, together with her main collaborator Drew Weissman, discovered that one of the four building blocks of the synthetic mRNA was at fault — and they could overcome the problem by swapping it out with a modified version.
They published a paper on the breakthrough in 2005. Then, in 2015, they found a new way to deliver mRNA into mice, using a fatty coating called “lipid nanoparticles” that prevent the mRNA from degrading, and help place it inside the right part of cells.
Both these innovations were key to the Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, where Kariko is now a senior vice president, as well as the shots produced by Moderna.
Both work by giving human cells the instructions to make a surface protein of the coronavirus, which simulates an infection and trains the immune system for when it encounters the real virus.
– New treatments –
The mRNA quickly degrades and the instructions it gives the body aren’t permanent, making the technology an ideal platform for a variety of applications, said Kariko.
These could range from new vaccines for influenza, faster to develop and more effective than the current generation, to new disease treatments.
For example, AstraZeneca is currently working on an mRNA treatment for heart failure patients, which delivers signaling proteins that stimulate the production of new blood vessels.
Though she does not want to make too much of it, as a foreign-born woman in a male-dominated field, she occasionally felt under-estimated — saying people would approach after lectures and ask “Who’s your supervisor?”
“They were always thinking, ‘That woman with the accent, there must be somebody behind her who is smarter or something,'” she said.
Now, should everything go well with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, it is not hard to imagine the Nobel Prize committee rewarding Kariko and fellow mRNA researchers.That would be bittersweet for Kariko, whose late mother would call her every year after the announcements to ask why she hadn’t been chosen.“‘I never in my life get (federal) grants, I am nobody, not even faculty'” she would laugh. To which her mother would reply: “But you work so hard!” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

France will receive around 1.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by year end, Prime Minister Jean Castex said Wednesday, adding another 2.3 million will arrive in the next two months.
The delivery of some 3.5 million doses will innoculate around 1.7 million people, with priority given to the elderly, the vulnerable and carers.
Covid vaccines are administered in two doses over several weeks.The government will “be much more transparent in this phase of the epidemic’s management,” the premier pledged, after authorities came under fire over the distribution of tests and masks earlier in the year.
“We should not miss this turn in the road” to inoculate people, he said.
Giving a breakdown, Castex said France will receive around 1.16 million doses by the end of the year, another 677,000 doses around 5-6 January, and around 1.6 million doses in February.
France has ordered a total of around 200 million doses, which would be enough to innoculate 100 million people. The country has a population of just under 70 million.Castex said that the start of the vaccine campaign was conditional on approval from the European Medicines Agency, expected on December 21.
“It is only at the end of spring that we will open the vaccination programme to the entire population”, he added.
Another problem for the French authorities is that according to an opinion poll, only 53 percent of people want to be vaccinated, among the lowest rates in the world.“We must remember that if a vaccine is authorised, it is only at the end of a rigorous procedure of tests and evaluations, both at the European and national levels,” Castex assured.
France on Tuesday ended its second virus lockdown but that has been replaced by an overnight curfew from 8:00 pm.
Over 59,000 people have died of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Indonesian President Joko Widodo said Wednesday, December 16, he would be the first person in the country to be vaccinated for COVID-19 as he unveiled a campaign promising free inoculations for everyone in world’s fourth most-populous nation.
Pres. Joko Widodo
Jokowi’s announcement comes as Indonesia battles misinformation over the virus in order to stave off a fresh wave of infections, with some 630,000 recorded by Wednesday and more than 19,000 deaths.
“The COVID-19 vaccine for all citizens will be free,” Jokowi said in a video on his Twitter account.The government originally said only health workers, the elderly and other key personnel would be given the vaccine for free.
Jokowi did not say when he would take the vaccine, or when the national inoculation program would start.
But said he was happy to be the first to be inoculated in order to prove it was safe.
“There’s no reason people shouldn’t get the vaccine or doubt its safety,” he added.
Indonesia has signed deals for more than 350 million vaccine doses from various international pharmaceutical companies – including British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca and Chinese suppliers Sinovac.
The current vaccine deals do not, however, provide enough doses for the required two per person that would cover Indonesia’s entire 270-million population.
The country received its first delivery of 1.2 million Sinovac doses this month, with another 1.8 million to arrive in January. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

With the procurement of the coronavirus vaccine on the line, Vice President Leni Robredo on Wednesday urged the government not to make the same mistake – slow response to curb the spread of COVID-19 in March.
Vice-President Leni Robredo (OVP / Facebook / MANILA BULLETIN)
In a webinar hosted by Kaya Natin, which was co-founded by the vice president’s late husband Interior secretary Jesse Robredo, she lamented that the government is again behind in the procurement of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“If 2020 was a lesson to us, if we are quick to the draw, we will be able to respond well,” Robredo said.“The [timely procurement] of the vaccine will make up for the spread of the virus, right? If we are very swift on this [negotiating with pharmaceutical companies], we will be in line for the deliveries,” she said in Filipino.
The Vice President added that it will be easier to regain the confidence of the public that life can go back to normal if the government purchases the vaccines on time. “The longer we wait, that will be more difficult.”
Robredo also said that her office is ready to fill in the gaps in the procurement and distribution of the vaccines.
She reiterated her suggestion of having a priority list of recipients for the inoculation against COVID-19, adding that word has gotten to her office that the government hasn’t readied a list yet.This is contrary to the claims made by Presidential spokesman Harry Roque that they are ready with the priority list of people that will get the vaccine first.
But Robredo maintained that she doesn’t want to compete with the administration, but her office is ready to “appropriate funds to be able to help.”
Over the past days, the Vice President attended several briefings regarding the vaccines currently available in the market.“We still have a lot of briefings that are scheduled because we want to understand where we are now as far as the purchase of vaccines is concerned,” Robredo said, who also recently met with the logistics group to discuss the shipment of the vaccines.
She admitted that things “aren’t clear yet for us, [but] we will continue finding ways to get as much information as possible.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Speaker Lord Allan Velasco said five members of the immediate family of the immunization program beneficiaries will also be covered.
Velasco underscored the need to implement the program as a means of guaranteeing the passage of important legislative measures should the coronavirus pandemic continue to threaten public health.The House has registered 191 COVID-19 cases among its employees and House members.Five of those severely afflicted, including two solons, have died.
House Secretary General Mark Llandro Mendoza said 98 of the cases were discovered when the chamber conducted mass testing to start regular sessions last month.
According to Mendoza, a big number of the cases were community acquired.The House official said they have scheduled another RT-PCR mass testing next month.
Velasco said members of the House media will be included in the immunization program because he considers “our media friends” as “our family,” thus, they will be inoculated with whatever COVID-19 vaccine will be made available to the government.In a text message, Velasco said a P50-million budget coming from the House’s annual allocation will be set aside for the program.
“We’ve decided that for the normalcy of business in Congress, we’ve decided to set aside a certain amount for the vaccines, for purchasing of vaccines for our employees times five,” Velasco said.
However, House members are not included among the beneficiaries.“We’ll start to get the vaccines first for the employees and the media and their families.If there are supplies left, then that’s the time we use them for the House members and also five of the immediate members of their family,” said Velasco.

The specialist vaccine developer said the phase 1 and 2 trials, involving around 150 healthy adults, would focus on the drug’s safety and ability to stimulate an immune response at three different doses.
Supported by Britain’s National Institute of Health, the tests will takes place at several sites around the UK.Valneva hopes to determine the optimal dose of the vaccine in the second quarter of next year, putting it on track for approval by the autumn — several months later than its previous mid-2021 ambition.
As well as a firm order for 60 million doses, Britain has options to buy a further 130 million between 2022 and 2025 in a deal worth up to 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion, £1.2 billion).
Valneva’s vaccine contains a deactivated form of the virus that can prompt an immune response from the body but cannot harm health, the same technique used in its existing inoculation against Japanese encephalitis.
Based in Nantes in western France, Valneva employs around 500 people worldwide and already has two vaccines on the market, for Japanese encephalitis and cholera.It has a further vaccine against Lyme disease in phase 2 trials and a fourth, for the chikungunya virus, in phase 3.

Senator Pia S. Cayetano has filed a resolution calling for a Senate inquiry on the status of the country’s procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical supplies needed for inoculation, as well as the implementation of the country’s vaccination program against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Sen. Pia Cayetano
(Senate Public Relations & Information Bureau / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Cayetano’s Senate Resolution 597 filed last Monday stated that “[T]there is a need to review and examine our existing policies and programs to expedite the purchase of [COVID-19] vaccines and the necessary medical supplies to inoculate the desired number of the population, while ensuring that other health protocols necessary to deal with COVID-19 continue to be improved and implemented.’’
The lady senator said “it is critical to monitor the status of the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and medical supplies as well as the implementation of a national COVID-19 vaccination program”, to effectively protect Filipinos’ health and help the country build back better.“[E]ven in the United States, there is much concern about rolling out the vaccine efficiently as it is not only an issue of coordination between the government, healthcare professionals, and healthcare systems but also the involvement of local clinics and the general population because a single misstep may lead to the disruption of the entire system,” the resolution added.
Cayetano pointed out that while there are still vaccines undergoing trials, other nations have already secured enough by the end of 2021 for “nearly three times their current population.”
“[T]he United States closed a deal with Pfizer as early as July for 100 million vials, and has recently bought another 100 million from Moderna, while Canada, with the population of 38 million, has agreed to buy up to 76 million doses from Pfizer, and 414 million from other vaccine manufacturers,” she noted through her resolution.
Meanwhile, according to the National Task Force Against COVID-19, the Philippine government could secure advance procurement of the vaccines by the end of next year and get 30 to 50 million doses once they are rolled out.
This, Cayetano cited, would cover only 14 to 23 percent of our population, despite the World Health Organization’s pronouncement that 60 to 70 percent of a country’s population need to acquire immunity to break the chain of transmission.
Apart from COVID-19 vaccines, Cayetanosaid there are also other expenses that the government needs to prepare for to ensure the success of the country’s fight against the pandemic.
During the plenary deliberations on the Department of Health’s proposed 2021 budget, Cayetano as Senior Vice Chairwoman of the Senate Finance Committee said the discussion and, consequently, the budgetary allocation should not be limited to the purchase of the vaccines.She pointed out that allocations for other components of the vaccination process – such as storage, training of vaccinators, transportation, waste disposal, health promotion, surveillance, medical supplies like syringes and needles, and other costs for the roll out of the vaccination program – must also be carefully taken into consideration.
Cayetano stressed that another concern that should be taken into consideration is people’s willingness to be vaccinated.
As such, she said an effective information campaign to properly educate the public on the importance of vaccines and the necessary funds for such are also essential.
“Consideration for all these other components of the vaccination process should go together with our efforts to purchase the vaccines, to guarantee a more holistic approach in the next phase of our COVID-19 battle,” she added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

CLINICAL MATTERS
Dr. Edsel Maurice T. Salvana
It was the “shot” that was seen and heard around the world. On Dec. 8, the first-ever approved Covid-19 vaccine was given to a 90-year-old woman in the UK named Maggie. This became the first of many more vaccinations, marking a momentous shift in the battle against Covid-19.
The road to the Covid-19 vaccine was far from certain. Many doubted that a safe and effective vaccine could be produced in less than a year. The fastest time to develop a vaccine was four years. That was for the mumps vaccine. The preclinical and clinical studies encompassing phase 1 to phase 3 clinical trials of vaccine development are daunting. As pointed out by many scientists, though, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not start from scratch. This was not a rushed process. This vaccine has been in development for the past 17 years.When the original SARS coronavirus epidemic occurred in 2002, there was a rush to identify its weak spots. One of its vulnerabilities is its spike protein, the little knobs that give the coronavirus its distinctive appearance. Spike protein enables the virus to attack and enter human cells. The 2002 SARS outbreak fortunately fizzled out, but this meant that no vaccines could be clinically evaluated. With no more active infections, vaccines could no longer be tested.

When MERS emerged in 2012, there was renewed interest in developing a coronavirus vaccine. A lot of the vaccine knowledge developed for SARS was utilized to develop a vaccine for MERS. Again, the outbreak ended before clinical trials could begin. There is still some low-level transmission occurring sporadically among camel handlers in Saudi Arabia, but these are not enough to properly evaluate a vaccine. The effort to prove efficacy in humans was shelved. The SARS outbreak followed by the MERS outbreak a decade later led scientists to correctly deduce the arrival of yet another coronavirus. Scientists continued the laboratory work in hopes of being ready when the next outbreak occurred.
This foresight proved serendipitous. When Chinese scientists published the full genome of the novel coronavirus in January 2020, vaccine researchers from all over the world were ready. What followed was one of the most remarkable feats in the history of science and medicine. With international cooperation, several vaccines progressed from early phase I and II clinical trials to phase III clinical trials in just a few months. Vaccine after vaccine seemed promising as they hurdled the early phases, and doctors and scientists held their collective breaths as the progress seemed too good to be true. The US FDA set its target for approving a vaccine at 50 percent efficacy, which is a very low target. Setting the bar this low was a nod to the uncertainty surrounding this endeavor. When the data from the first phase 3 trial was reported by Pfizer, the results were stunning.
The Pfizer/BioNTechtwo-dose vaccine showed a 95 percent efficacy for prevention of Covid-19 infection among patients who had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Efficacy after only one dose was more than 52 percent. Just as encouraging, it showed an 89 percent efficacy for prevention of severe infection. Overall, the results from this first-ever Covid-19 vaccine exceeded the most optimistic expectations. This vaccine and the others that follow is the beginning of the end for the pandemic.Shortly after the Pfizer announcement, other pharmaceutical companies announced their interim phase 3 trial results. Moderna, Astra/Zeneca, and Sinopharm released vaccine efficacy figures ranging from 70 percent to 95 percent.
These phase 3 trials need to be completed with at least two months of safety data, but there is every reason to be optimistic that the data will be similar to the Pfizer/BioNTechexperience. The Moderna vaccine, which is also an RNA vaccine like that of Pfizer/BioNTech, has so far shown a 95 percent efficacy for preventing symptomatic Covid-19, and 100 percent efficacy for prevention of severe Covid-19. More interim results from other vaccine studies will soon be released, and there is good reason to hope that many more effective vaccines will be available by the first quarter of 2021.
The Pfizer FDA application states that there are adverse events from the vaccine, but most of these are mild and tolerable. Some clinical trial participants reported injection-site discomfort and flu-like symptoms, but the overall safety data between the vaccine recipients and the placebo control were similar. Recent reports of severe allergic reactions in two healthcare workers who had a history of severe allergies prompted the UK health authorities to caution people with a history of severe allergies against receiving the vaccine.Since people who had a history of severe allergies were excluded from the clinical trials, this precaution is prudent while the manufacturer and health authorities investigate the circumstances surrounding the events. They did not suspend administration of the vaccine in otherwise healthy people.
As more vaccines are released for use, more of these reactions or adverse events are expected, as is usual with new drugs. Safety data are continuously collected among those who were enrolled in the original clinical trials. The large number of subjects enrolled in these clinical trials means that any severe reaction that was missed would be very rare, with a less than one in 10,000 probability of occurrence. These rarer adverse events, if any, can be captured with good phase 4 post-marketing surveillance by manufacturers and health authorities.
I get repeatedly asked whether I would take the vaccine if it were offered to me today. As long as it is a properly approved vaccine proven to be safe and efficacious, I would not hesitate to take it. As a healthcare worker and frontliner, I am much more concerned about contracting Covid-19 that can kill me or my loved ones than the possibility of rare side effects. Covid-19 is a clear and present danger to us all, and vaccines are a way out of the constant fear of infection. I would recommend it to my parents and my in-laws who are in their 70s and their 80s respectively. I would give it to my kids once clinical data for children are available. I can’t wait for my kids to go back to physical school again. I want to be free of the constant fear that I may bring home something deadly from work. Vaccination will allow us to be with friends and family again. Vaccination will restore that most important of human experiences, the ability to touch each other and hold those closest to us.

The Philippine government’s choice for which coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine to buy should be based on science, not a political favor.
Opposition Senator Risa Hontiveros issued this statement as experts raised questions on the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Chinese pharmaceutical Sinovac, which government entered a deal with recently for 25 million doses for roll-out in the first quarter of 2021.
Sen. Risa Hontiveros
(Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Hontiveros said that the Sinovac vaccine has yet to undergo assessment by the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).She stressed that there is “no problem if the Chinese vaccine is safe, effective and cheap” but the domestic agencies need to “back it up with scientific proof before we make any commitments.”
“This stands for any and all possible vaccines. No shortcuts,” she added.
This developed as Senator Sherwin T. Gatchalian said the FDA should be more proactive in getting vaccines approved.
‘’They cannot just wait for applications to fall on their lap. The country is losing P5 billion a day in economic losses under this pandemic. We need to go back to work and jumpstart the economy,’’ he added.Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said an offer was made to secure the country 10 million doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine as early as January 2021.
“But somebody dropped the ball,” he added in his Twitter account.
Reacting, Senator Panfilo M. Lacson suggested to Locsin that ‘’next time, don’t pass it to that doggone ‘sanamagan’ teammate of yours. He keeps dropping the ball. Our people need those vaccines!’’Lacson did not identify who this ‘’sanamagan’’ is. “Before we declare preference of any vaccine, I remind government that the first and only priority should be safety. Bago subukan, dapat safe at walang malubhang side effect ang bakuna na ituturok sa ilang milyong Pinoy. Bawat health standard at safety step ay dapat sundan. Hindi ito dapat madaliin,” Hontiveros said. (Before injecting {the vaccine} to millions of Filipinos, the vaccine must be safe and there are no serious side effects. Health standards and safety step should be followed. There is no need to rush things.)
“There are multiple and undeniable issues surrounding the vaccine offered by China, including transparency of data and results, emerging side effects as seen in Peru and even a company history of bribery. This is enough reason to worry. If we want people to trust the government’s decisions and to trust vaccination, we need to earn it. There should be no compromises. Follow the protocol,” she said.
Hontiveros pointed out that the Sinovac vaccine is one of the most expensive available in the market at P3,629.50 in the Department of Health’s (DOH) projection of prices.
“So if it hasn’t been proven to be safe, and it isn’t even cheap, what is the basis for our preference for this vaccine?” she asked.
The lady senator also warned against China’s ‘vaccine diplomacy,’ citing leading research center Yusof Ishak Institute findings that the vaccine supply is “not unconditional” and that it could be used as a tool to advance the country’s interest in the West Philippine Sea.
“Hindi tayo dapat basta-basta bibili ng bakuna. Do not sacrifice Filipinos’ health on the altar of the President’s bias towards China, which has continuously denied the Hague ruling and abused our waters,” she said. (We should not just buy vaccines.)
‘’This is about health, not politics. We shouldn’t entertain political favors when livesare at stake, especially not those that can be harmful to the sovereignty of the country. Hindi dapat maging kapalit ng bakuna ang pananahimik ng bansa sa patuloy na pangangamkam at pagbabastos ng China sa West Philippine Sea (WPS),” Hontiveros added.

The World Health Organization said Tuesday it is in discussions with Pfizer and Moderna about possibly including their high-tech coronavirus vaccines among early jabs for poor countries at affordable prices.
The WHO-backed Covax facility, created to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines around the world as they become available, is aiming to provide some two billion doses by the end of next year.It has already secured hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine candidates being developed by AstraZeneca, Novavax and Sanofi-GSK.WHO senior advisor Bruce Aylward said the organisation was looking at a range of other jabs, as well as the current frontrunners.
He said WHO was “in conversations” with Pfizer and Moderna about whether their products could be part of “early roll-out of vaccines”.
But, he stressed, “we also need to make sure that they are at prices that are appropriate for the populations we are trying to serve and the countries we are trying to help.”US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has, along with German BioNTech, created the first coronavirus jab to receive regulatory approval in a number of Western countries. Vaccination campaigns have already begun in Britain and the United States.The Moderna vaccine is expected to quickly receive approvals as well.
– Light, but a long tunnel –
Both vaccines use cutting-edge technology and have been shown in Phase III trials to be highly effective — and they are expected to be expensive.
But Aylward hailed public comments from Pfizer chief Albert Bourla in which he talked about cutting prices for low-income countries.“He has said we are committed to making sure that our products see global use and we recognise that requires pricing it at the right level to be able to make that work,” Aylward said.
“So there is a strong commitment from Pfizer out there to be able to do that.”Covax wanted to have a diverse portfolio of vaccines to offer and would evaluate “any product out there with demonstrated efficacy, safety, quality”, he added.
The vaccines developed by China and Russia could also be evaluated for inclusion “if they meet the standards for efficacy and safety”, he said.
A year into the pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.6 million lives worldwide, Aylward hailed the positive vaccine news over the past month.“There is light at the end of the tunnel,” he said. But while there was “a bright light at the end of it, getting brighter, it is a long tunnel.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON — The US regulator on Tuesday released new data confirming Moderna’s COVID19 vaccine was safe and effective, a strong sign that it could receive emergency approval in days and be ready to roll out by next week.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said there were “no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA (emergency use authorization)” and confirmed an overall efficacy of 94.1 percent.

Distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine began on Monday and if the FDA green lights Moderna’s, rollout of some six million doses could start next Monday.That would represent a powerful second weapon in the country with the world’s biggest outbreak of the virus, where more than 300,000 people have died and a winter surge is raging.
Also Tuesday, the FDA announced it had approved the first at-home rapid COVID-19 test, which will be available without prescription and return results in about 20 minutes.
But supply of the test, made by California-based Ellume, will initially be limited, with just three million units expected in January.
Stops severe cases
The FDA document on the Moderna vaccine offered the clearest look yet into the two-dose regimen, co-developed with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Moderna began working on the vaccine in January and has received $2.5 billion in federal funds.
On Thursday, an independent group of scientists will convene to debate everything known so far about the product.
The panel is expected to vote in favor of an EUA, and the FDA normally heeds its recommendations. According to the new data, the shots protected younger people slightly better than older people.In a clinical trial of 30,400 people, 196 fell ill with COVID-19 by November 21 – 11 in the vaccine group and 185 in the placebo group.
Efficacy was 95.6 percent for people aged 18-65; 86.4 percent among those aged 65 and older; and 94.1 percent overall. Importantly, of 30 cases of severe COVID-19, all occurred in the placebo group.
The FDA also looked at detailed safety data at a median of nine weeks after participants received the second shot, 28 days after the first.
Cutting-edge technology
The most common side effects associated with the drug, called mRNA-1273, were injection site pain in roughly 90 percent of cases; fatigue in 70 percent, headache in 60 percent, muscle pain in 60 percent, joint pain in 45 percent and chills in 45 percent.
Few of these effects were classed as “severe” and, when they were, that tended to occur more in the young than in the old.Lymphadenopathy, or swollen lymph nodes, occurred in 1.1 percent of the vaccine group against 0.6 percent of the placebo group.
There was an imbalance in allergic reactions, which occurred in 1.5 percent of the vaccinated population compared to 1.1 percent of the non-vaccinated.
But none were classed as severe or anaphylactic.
The frequency of life-threatening events was low, around one percent in each group, with no suggestion the vaccine was the cause.
To date, there have been three reports of Bell’s palsy – a facial paralysis condition, most often temporary – in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group.
The Pfizer trial saw four people get Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group, and none in the placebo group.
The FDA said there was insufficient information to determine that either vaccine was the cause.
Andrew Morris, a University of Toronto professor of medicine who has studied the condition, said “it is becoming increasingly likely that there is an important relationship with Bell’s (facial) palsy.”
However, “the absolute risk – in light of the risks associated with COVID19 – is small,” he stressed.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) molecules to cause human cells to express a surface molecule of the new coronavirus.
This simulates an infection and trains the immune system to be ready in case it encounters the real virus.
The mRNA is encased inside fatty particles. Both companies used a slightly different formulation resulting in different cold-storage requirements: -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) for Pfizer; -20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) for Moderna. Moderna has applied for approval in over-18s, while Pfizer’s approval is for over-16s. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Christopher “Bong” Go today urged the national government to conduct a massive information campaign to educate the public on the ongoing process that government is taking to secure safe and effective coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines for Filipinos.Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go
(OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Go, chairman of the Senate health and demography committee, emphasized the need to inform the public on the various modes of procurement — as well as plans on the eventual distribution and use — until expected full recovery through ‘herd immunity’ is achieved when the COVID-19 vaccine roadmap is properly implemented.“Huwag nating pabayaan ang mga ordinaryong Pilipino. Bigyan dapat ng tamang impormasyon ang publiko para hindi matakot at magkaroon ng confidence ukol sa mga vaccines na ito ,’’ he said. (Do not ignore the ordinary Filipinos. Provide the public with accurate information to allay fears and boost their confidence on these vaccines.)Earlier, President Duterte and Go have expressed their willingness to be one of the first to get a dose of the vaccine to encourage the public and allay fears on its safety and efficacy.
“Ako, I’m very much willing na mauna kami ni Pangulong Duterte just to prove to the people na safe na po ito (I’m very much willing that I and President Duterte would be the first to be inoculated just to prove to the people that this is safe),” he said during an ambush interview right after he led the distribution of assistance to typhoon victims in Arayat, Pampanga.
He later proceeded to Candaba to aid more typhoon victims there after the interview.
Go has also challenged Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. to be injected first to further build public confidence.
“Kunin natin ang kumpiyansa [ng mga tao]… Maraming gustong magpaturok pero takot ang attitude ng Pilipino ngayon. Kayo [government officials] muna ang mauna para mawala ang takot ng tao. Totoo naman, dapat safe, unahin natin ang safety. Mahirap naman magsisihan sa huli,’’ he stressed. (Let’s get the confidence of the people…there are many people who want to be inoculated but they are afraid. The government officials should be the first to be injected to allay the fears of the public. It is true that we should prioritize the safety of the vaccine. It is hard to regret later.
A phone survey conducted by the Social Weather Station (SWS) from September 17 to 20 revealed that 31 percent of Filipinos are unwilling to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Thirty two percent said they would “definitely” get the vaccine while 34 percent responded that they would “probably” get vaccinated.
Go also emphasized the commitment of the government to prioritize the poor and vulnerable sectors, as well as frontliners, including medical workers, teachers and uniformed personnel once a safe and effective vaccine is determined.
As Senate health committee chairman, Go has always reminded authorities to urgently act on the matter while following the necessary processes to ensure that public resources are properly utilized in pursuit of the availability of sufficient COVID-19 vaccines.He also assured that the government is exploring several ways to secure enough vaccines for the Filipinos.Go earlier said that the proposed 2021 budget includes an appropriated amount for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccine, and an unprogrammed appropriation which could also be used for this purpose.
He further explained that on top of the 2021 budget and the amount allocated through the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act intended for direct procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, there are other various modes of procurement for the vaccines that the Duterte Administration is exploring.
“Other equally important modes include multilateral loans with the ADB and World Bank, bilateral loans with select countries, and private sector financing through tripartite agreement among the national government, pharmaceutical company and a private company, with no cost to the government,” he explained.
He emphasized the need for everyone’s commitment to act responsibly by following the health and safety protocols issued by government.“Ngayong Pasko, ingat muna tayo habang nandyan ang COVID-19. ‘Wag muna kayong magparty. Kasama ang pamilya n’yo, dasal kayo, kumain kayo ng Noche Buena, kayo-kayo lang, ‘wag muna kayo mag-imbita ng kapitbahay, ‘wag muna kayong lumabas habang wala pang vaccine,’’ he said. (This Christmas, we have to be careful while COVID-19 is there. We should not party. Pray with your family, take your Noche Buena by yourselves, do not invite your neighbors, do not go out while there is still no vaccine.) SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

CEBU CITY—The city will be one of the local government units (LGU) that will be prioritized in the distribution of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines. This was the assurance given by the country’s vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, said City Mayor Edgar Labella. “I just talked to Secretary Galvez and he informed me that Cebu City will be prioritized once the vaccine is available,” Labella said in a press conference on Tuesday.
 Labella said the city will be purchasing the vaccines to augment the doses that the national government will be providing to the city. Labella said P500 million will be included in the 2021 annual budget for the purchase of the vaccines. “We have to wait for the guidelines. I was told there has to be a tripartite agreement between the supplier and the city and national governments,” said Labella. If possible, 100 percent of the city population will be vaccinated, said Labella. “It was said that only 70 percent of the community will be vaccinated just to have herd immunity. But if we can, we will have a 100 percent vaccination,” the mayor said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Former National Task Force (NTF) special adviser Dr. Tony Leachon said he was “surprised” that Presidential spokesman Harry Roque and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez did not answer his questions regarding the government’s vaccine acquisition plans, and instead resorted to “ad hominem attacks.”

“I’m not surprised that this has been the reaction. My only surprise is they did not answer the question on efficacy and safety data and then resorted to those kinds of assaults which I think will be unfair to my personality,” Leachon told ANC in an interview on Tuesday.
“I was just asking a fair scientific question in order to gain the confidence of the people in terms of their acceptance of vaccination,” he added.Roque and Galvez both slammed Leachon after the latter tweeted that the government’s prioritization of vaccines which does not have “enough safety and efficacy data” is “disturbing.”
The former NTF adviser pointed out that the vaccine by Chinese manufacturer Sinovac Biotech which the government is inclined to purchase have not received any Emegrycn Use Aithtozition (EUA) nor any Food and Drugs Admiandatrio (FDA) approval “to warrant an ordering of a particular volume of stock that will start in March.”
“Basically that is the premise of the situation why I was questioning the efficacy rate and the safety considering that particular drug was started in mass vaccination in China when the vaccine has not finished Phase 3 trials so this is the questions that we need to understand,” Leachon said.
The health expert also denied that he is “anti-China,” saying it was not the reason why he is questioning the possible procurement of the Sinovac-made vaccine.“As a clinician, as well as a former executive of a pharmaceutical industry, you always base the procurement of a certain product based on efficacy and safety and of course the evaluation because this is the main thing that would actually allow you for market authorization,” he said.
The health expert said that Sinovac has yet to have “regulatory documents.”
“We don’t have the regulatory documents for efficacy and safety which should be transparent and should be reviewed by our public health experts as well as other epidemiologists,” he said.Leachon reiterated that his questions for “scientific” and “collegial.”
“It is my role as a health advocate to really tell the truth regarding certain medical aspects of the COVID pandemic response,” he said.
Leachon also shot down Roque’s accusation that the health expert is gunning for a position in the government.
“That’s not correct because I’ve been a health advocate for eight months and for the information of the public meron po akong disentetng buhay (I have a decent life), I have a good life,” he said.
“I’d like to reiterate and emphasize that I’m not gunning for any public office, I’m not going to be a public official in the future. I’m doing this without expecting anything in return. I have nothing to gain in this particular advocacy work of mine,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Opposition Senator Risa Hontiveros today questioned the capacity of the National Taskforce on COVID-19 (NTF) and the Department of Health (DOH) to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine to geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA) given the unsolved difficulties in existing immunization programs.
Sen. Risa Hontiveros (Albert Calvelo/Senate PRIB)
“A documented difficulty by the DOH in the Sabayang Patak Laban sa Polio is the low immunization coverage in some areas, owing to the difficulties in terrain. Magkakalayo ang mga bahay at mahirap ang mga dadaanan. Hindi pa ito matugunan ng DOH ngayon, so paano natin masisiguro na itong COVID-19 vaccine ay makakarating sa mga nangangailangan, given na napaka-sensitibo ng bakuna sa temperature changes?” she asked. (…Houses are located in far places. The DOH has not solved this problem. Now, how sure are we that the COVID-19 vaccines could reach target areas, given the fact that these vaccines are sensitive to temperature changes?)
“I support Senator (Francis) Pangilinan’s call for a hearing by a Senate Committee of the Whole to iron out all the details from preparations, to roll-out, to finish. As I said before, public trust is crucial in a public health crisis. This is a massive project that should be made clear to the whole of government, whole of society. Everyone has to be confident in the game plan,’’ Hontiveros said.Hontiveros also called for government to begin creating a post-vaccination COVID-19 response plan after an editorial published in November in the Nature Journal showed that vaccinated individuals can still spread the coronavirus to others.
“To my layperson’s ears, it means you can be protected from COVID-19 but you can pass it on to others. I imagine that there are specific populations that cannot be vaccinated, like the very young. They will continue to be vulnerable to COVID. We cannot let our guard down and the protocols should be maintained,” she said.
Hontiveros warned that vaccination is not the ‘’magic bullet’’ to putting an end to the pandemic.
‘’We must create sustainable strategies for safely co-existing with COVID-19 while we roll-out vaccination,” she added. “It is of the utmost importance that we think of the end in mind, if not we might see a whole new wave of infections.”Hontiveros added that after the vaccination of the indigent groups, it is important to begin securing and allocating funds for mass vaccination. “We can only achieve herd immunity if 60-70 percent of the population gets vaccinated. If the DOH and NTF foresee the process to take the next four to five years, are we financially prepared to make it happen? The threat of a hiccup in our plans might cost lives,” she said.
“Ito ang pinakamalaking vaccination program in the history of our country. If we don’t do it right, we’ll waste billions of pesos and risk millions of lives,” she added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON — More than 300,000 people in the United States have died from COVID-19, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally on Monday, as the country started its desperately-awaited vaccine program.Sandra Lindsay(L), a nurse at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, became the first person in the US to receive the COVID-19 vaccine
The grim milestone was reached on the day that New York nurse Sandra Lindsay became the first person in America to receive the Pfizer BioNTech shot, live on television.The country has recorded more than 16.3 million COVID-19 cases.Over the last two weeks, the Johns Hopkins database has often registered more than 2,500 deaths from COVID19 every day, hitting over 3,000 on both Wednesday and Saturday.The shocking number of fatalities – by far the highest in the world – underlined the US’s struggle to control the pandemic as authorities have given often mixed messages on mask-wearing, social distancing and shutdowns.President Donald Trump and senior officials have also repeatedly downplayed the risks while cases have spread across the country.Authorities had warned a spike in deaths was coming after millions traveled around the country for the Thanksgiving holiday last month.
An initial 2.9 million vaccine doses are set to be delivered to 636 sites around the US by Wednesday, with officials saying 20 million Americans could receive the two shot regimen by year end, and 100 million by March.Health workers see hope in vaccine
After Lindsay, more frontliners received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.Raymond Pla, an anesthesiologist in a slammed emergency department, was one of five front line workers at George Washington University Hospital to receive the vaccine.
He handles COVID patients’ ventilators, one of the riskiest jobs in the pandemic.A single word captured what it meant to him: “Hope.”The doctor might have felt excited to be among the first in the world to get injected with molecules of synthetic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), the cutting-edge technology proven to be 95 percent effective in preventing COVID-19.But given the coronavirus’ stark toll – 300,000 fatalities in the US alone – that just didn’t feel right.“Excitement, in my personal view, doesn’t give the appropriate amount of deference and respect and honor to the sacrifice of my colleagues in health care, some of whom have gotten sick, some of whom have died,” said the visibly emotional 52- year-old.
A distant light is glimmering at the end of the tunnel, but in the spring the situation appeared bleak to inundated health care workers like Pla: “I didn’t have a lot of hope back then there would be a vaccine by the end of the year.”Leading the way Pla and his colleagues said they felt honored as the first recipients, a group chosen through an algorithm that assessed risk levels.They also want to use their platforms to encourage others to follow their lead.Shylee Stewart, a 26-year-old registered nurse in the labor and delivery department, said the vaccine was “beneficial” given how many COVID-positive patients with unknown status come through, adding that most of the nurses in her department planned to get shots.She encouraged ordinary people to “do your research; make sure you make the right decision for yourself.”“Nine times out of 10, that decision is to get vaccinated,” she said.Her message comes at a time of growing vaccine skepticism, not only in the United States but across much of the developed world.A new poll by NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist College found that 61 percent of Americans say they’ll choose to get the coronavirus vaccine if it is made available, against 32 percent who said they wouldn’t.An unmasked anti-vaxxer heckler interrupted Monday’s press interviews with those being vaccinated, but the surveys show that overall national confidence is increasing, highlighting the importance of such events.Pla, a Black physician, said he felt an added level of responsibility toward his community and other racial minorities, who have been let down by a history of unethical medical research, along with medicine’s institutional racism that persists today.He said it would be vital to be “going out into the community and spreading the word” in the weeks and months ahead.Meanwhile, an Ontario caregiver and an octogenarian in Quebec on Monday became the first people vaccinated against COVID-19 in Canada.Anita Quidangen was televised receiving the injection at a hospital in Toronto as part of a major vaccination campaign in Canada, less than a week after the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was granted approval in the country.Another woman, 89-year-old Gisele Levesque, was vaccinated minutes earlier at a retirement home in Quebec City, but her procedure was not shown on TV, Quebec Health Minister Christian Dube revealed shortly afterwards.“I’m okay,” Quidangen told the press. The employee of a long-term care center for seniors in Toronto said she was “excited” about receiving the vaccine so quickly. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A former adviser of the national task force on the coronavirus response has drawn profanity-laced tirade from President Duterte although such remarks were not carried live in his public address, Malacañang said Monday.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque disclosed that the President has shown his dismay with Dr. Anthony Leachon after suspecting the medical professional was aspiring for a government post.

Roque issued the statement after Leachon expressed concern with the government’s effort to prioritize certain vaccines despite lack of safety and efficacy data.“Tatapatin ko na si Dr. Leachon. Na-edit lang sa mga ‘Talk to the people’ pero ang daming beses na namura kayo ng Presidente kasi ang sabi niya kung anu-ano ang sinasabi mo yunpala nagnanais ka lang ng posisyon sa gobyeryno (I will be frank with Dr. Leachon. The President’s ‘Talk to the people’ have been edited but there were many times you were cursed by the President because he said you’re saying so many things and yet it appears you’re just aspiring for a government post),” Roque said during a televised press briefing.
“Next time murahin kayo ng Presidente (When the President curses you next time), I will insist it will be shown to the people. Baka akalain niyo natutuwa ang Presidente sa inyo, hindi po (You might think the President is pleased with you but he is not),” he added.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also slammed Leachon during the same virtual press conference, citing his difficulty in working with him when he was part of the task force. He said Leachon, who had a brief stint as special adviser to the NTF last June, made some “very questionable” pronouncements.
“Sa NTF, nagsama kami. Mahirap po siyang kasama. May sariling mundo (We were together at the NTF. He’s difficult to deal with. He has his own world),” Galvez said.The former military official’s comment triggered laughter from Roque during the virtual press conference. “Mas maganda ang linya mo (You have a better line) Secretary Galvez. Thank you,” he said.
Leachon earlier tweeted his concern about the government’s vaccine acquisition plans and called for transparency. “Isn’t it disturbing that the government is still prioritizing the vaccines for which they’re are not enough safety and efficacy data? Perhaps we need to know the matrix or guidelines on their priority list. Transparency is key.Safety is paramount,” he said.
Reacting to the latest statement from the Palace, Leachon dispelled talk that he was eyeing a government post. He explained that he merely raised concern about the need to have safe and effective vaccines in the country.“It’s painful to be accused of something which is baseless and untrue. I have been an independent health reform advocate for many years. I have the highest respect for our President and the government,” he said.“I’m raising a red flag on efficacy and safety data on the vaccines so we can procure the right vaccine for our country. I dreamt of serving the government before but I have no future ambitions to be a public official.I’d like to spend my sunset years with the family, closest friends , and doing advocacy work,” he added.
Back in June, Leachon announced on Twitter that he was no longer an adviser of the NTF a day after expressing disappointment with the Department of Health in leading the efforts against the coronavirus outbreak.Galvez later confirmed that Leachon was let go due to the need for concerned officials to work together in battling the pandemic.He claimed that Leachon’s preemptive release of information “jeopardized” the government’s messaging in addressing the pandemic as well as caused “unwarranted misunderstanding” between the NTF and the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).

Opposition Sen. Leila de Lima has filed a bill seeking to provide free COVID-19 vaccines to all Filipinos.
De Lima, in filing Senate Bill No. 1942 or the Libreng Bakuna Kontra COVID-19 Para sa Lahat ng Pilipino Act, reiterated the need to safeguard the health of Filipinos by allocating funds and mandating the country’s health system to offer the vaccines free of charge.

“Anticipating the arrival of these vaccines subject to trials and local evaluation soonest, this representation believes the need to guarantee free vaccination for all Filipinos whose right to health should not be diminished by belatedly acting on the health crisis,” De Lima said.
As hopes grow for the early arrival of the vaccines in the country, she said the government must be prepared and guarantee people safe and efficient distribution of the vaccine especially the priority and vulnerable sectors of society.
“It cannot be overemphasized: Vaccine coverage is as important as vaccine efficacy,” she stressed.
De Lima noted the government’s vaccination plan “leaves much to be desired” despite the Executive branch’s report about its continued negotiations with pharmaceutical companies for at least 14 specific COVID-19 vaccines for local use.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez had earlier said the government is targeting to vaccinate 60 to 70 percent of the country’s population, with elderly citizens, frontliners, and those included in the vulnerable sectors to be prioritized in the immunization program.
But Galvez also claimed that the country would now have to fight for the remaining percentage of future COVID-19 vaccine supplies as rich countries had already procured 80 percent of the global market.
De Lima, however, said this should not be an excuse for a delayed response in securing vaccine supplies since there are new suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines with equally good efficacy rates that have already emerged.
“A concrete plan of action that will universally promote the right of all Filipinos to health is vital in winning this battle against COVID-19,” she said.
“A vaccination plan that is inclusive will be an instrument to create herd immunity in a country of more than 100 million.”De Lima said the bill also provides informed consent to allow persons to choose which accredited COVID-19 vaccine to receive and the institutions from which to receive them.
The measure likewise mandates the creation of a database to ensure the tracking of vaccination recipients in case of problems that may arise after the administration of the vaccines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

All signs point to pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and minors under 16-years-old not getting any COVID-19 vaccine shots in the foreseeable future due to safety concerns, said Anakalusugan party-list Rep. Mike Defensor Sunday, as the very promising Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is beginning to make waves abroad, particularly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada where it has been approved for use.
(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
“For now, the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE cannot be used in individuals younger than 16-years-old, based on our comprehensive review of the EUAs (emergency use authorizations) issued by pharmaceutical regulators in the three countries,” Defensor said.
“The use of the vaccine in pregnant women and mothers who are breastfeeding is also either totally not recommended, or being discouraged with stern warnings,” Defensor, a Health committee vice chairman, also said.“We expect our own Food and Drug Administration here to affirm the same recommendations – once the vaccine gets an EUA here – simply because the safety and efficacy of the shots in children under 16, pregnant women, and mothers who are breastfeeding has yet to established by further clinical trials,” he said.
The House leadership said it’s plausible that the same recommendations would apply to all newly developed COVID-19 vaccines that would eventually obtain EUAs in the Philippines.
Defensor’s assessment came just as the Philippines is expected to undergo a “baby boom” owing to lockdowns and strict stay-at-home orders as a result of the pandemic.The Commission on Population and Development said the country will record two million pregnancies this year, some 214,000 of which are unplanned.
Defensor said that in Britain, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is “absolutely not recommended for use in pregnant women and mothers who are breastfeeding.”“In fact, under their immunization guidelines, in all women of child-bearing age, pregnancy has to be ruled out first prior to vaccination. Women of child-bearing age are also being told to avoid pregnancy for at least two months after their second dose of the vaccine,” he said.The vaccine is meant to be administered intramuscularly in the arm in a series of two doses 21 days apart.“It is unknown whether the vaccine is excreted in human milk, and risks to newborns and infants cannot be excluded. Thus, in Britain, they are not recommending the shots during breastfeeding,” Defensor said.Meanwhile, having a clear budget for the purchase of the coronavirus vaccines should be the government’s top priority to address the public health crisis, Vice President Leni Robredo’s spokesperson said Sunday.Speaking on Robredo’s weekly radio show, Barry Gutierrez said he was surprised over the lack of a definite source of funds to immunize millions of Filipinos next year.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon hadclaimed the P72.5 billion earmarked for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget is like an “unfunded check.”Under the P4.5-trillion national budget for next year, only P2.5 billion out of the P72.5 billion vaccine allocation is funded.
The remaining P70 billion, according to Drilon, is allocated under the “unprogrammed funds” provision of the 2021 General Appropriations Bill (GAB) which the Senate and the House ratified last week.“‘Di ba dapat iyan ang una nating tinitiyak na mayroon tayong pondo lalo na itong bakuna. Narinig ko na sinabi ng Pangulo ito ilang beses na sa dulo ang pinakasolusyon lang sa COVID – bakuna,” he said.(Shouldn’t the first thing we make sure is we have funds especially for the vaccines. I heard the President said this a few times the best solution to COVID at the end is vaccine)“Kung anong pera mayroon tayo dapat diyan agad ilagay ‘yan. Bakit mo ilalagay sa ibang ahensya? Ito ‘yung pinakaimportante,” Gutierrez added.(We should put whatever funds we have for that. Why would you allocate it to other agencies? This is the most important)Robredo’s spokesman lamented the administration’s “lack of sense of urgency” in securing COVID-19 vaccines supply when there is a global race to buy the vaccines.
“Nagtataka ako bakit parang hindi pa tayo masyadong kumikilos (I’m wondering why we haven’t taken much action),” he said. “Hindi nga tayo nagbayad ng reservation fee (We haven’t paid yet the reservation fee).” (With a report from Raymund F. Antonio) SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The National Institute of Health said Friday that it had decided to interrupt the trial after a volunteer had difficulty moving their arms, according to local media.
“Several days ago we signaled, as we are required, to the regulatory authorities that one of our participants (in trials) presented neurological symptoms which could correspond to a condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome,” said chief researcher German Malaga in comments to the press. 
Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare and non-contagious disorder which affects the movement of the arms and legs. Peru declared a temporary health emergency in five regions in June last year following multiple cases.In the 1970s a campaign to innoculate Americans against a supposedly devastating strain of swine flu ground to a halt after some 450 of those vaccinated developed the syndrome, which can also cause paralysis.
Peru’s clinical trials for the Sinopharm vaccine were due to conclude this week, after testing around 12,000 people.If they are successful — which won’t be known until mid-2021 — the Peruvian government was expected to buy up to 20 million doses to inoculate two-thirds of its population.60,000 across the globe have already taken the Sinopharm vaccine, including volunteers in Argentina, Russia and Saudi Arabia.Peru has one of the world’s highest per capita death rate from the virus, which as of Friday had caused 36,499 deaths and 979,111 infections.The pandemic has hit the South American country’s economy hard, with GDP plunging more than 30 percent in the second quarter.

Government purchase of COVID-19 vaccines has been spared from the participation of the Philippine International Trade Corp., a State-run government firm that has been smarting from criticisms from senators and State auditors for its alleged snail-paced procurement of equipment and supplies by a number of agencies.
In a virtual briefing conducted by PITC for members of the House Committee on Trade and Industry, Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon Lopez disclosed that so far, PITC has not been asked to take a role in the purchase of much-needed vaccines from international drug laboratories and suppliers.
“Sa ngayon wala pang role ang PITC, ang immediate procurement agency is PS-DBM (Right now PITC has not been given a role),” Lopez told lawmakers during the meeting with lawmakers.Lopez and PITC President Dave Alimurung briefed solons on PITC tasks in the procurement by various government agencies of supplies and materials that can be sourced from international suppliers.
The two defended PITC from accusations that it had “parked” over P33 billion entrusted by agencies that relied on the State-owned importer to help purchase equipment and supplies.
Asked by Marikina City Rep. Stella Luz Quimbo if PITC will be involved in COVID-19 vaccine procurement, Lopez said a special vaccine committee, not the PITC, will do it.
“PITC has not been asked to joint certain meetings pagdating sa vaccine purchase,” said Lopez.
Solons present during the meeting no longer commented on Lopez’s statement.
In the recently-released 2019 annual audit report for PITC, CoA disclosed that as of end of the year, over P9.17 billion from various agencies remained unutilized for a period of ten years starting 2009.
“These unutilized fund transfers were not yet returned to the concerned client-government agencies and or national government contrary to the provisions under Section 10 of the General Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019 on the Reversion, Closure, and Transfer of Special Accounts,” said CoA.
Auditors also noted that interest earnings amounting to P581.135 million from money market placements of parked funds have not been recorded as PITC income, instead of remitting the money to the National Treasury.
Reacting to the CoA findings, Alimurung said a total of P324 million has already been remitted to the national coffers.
A check on 2019 annual audit reports of other agencies that were released this year indicated that PITC has delayed or has failed to deliver various procurement items from these agencies.
In a recent audit report, CoA blamed the PITC for the delayed delivery of three brand new aircraft for the training program being conducted by the Philippine State College of Aeronautics.
Together with the PS-DBM, PITC was also blamed by CoA for failing to deliver on time over P1.4-billion supplies and equipment paid for by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources last year.
The Bureau of Fire Protection audit report also chided PITC and PS-DBM for receiving P4.309 billion in funds for the purchase of supplies materials and equipment and the implementation of various infrastructure projects.
Despite receiving the allocation from the BFP, the two procurement agencies have failed to deliver the orders for several years now.
As a result of the snail-paced procurement process, CoA said the BFP was deprived of immediate use of the items which are crucial in the discharge of the agency’s operation.
State auditors said this has also “unnecessarily made the fund idle in the custody of the PS-DBM and PITC.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

DAVAO CITY – An official from a foreign government has reportedly reached out to the Davao City government, offering to provide much-needed vaccines against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) once the Philippine government issues an emergency use authorization (EUA).
Mayor Sara Duterte (Facebook / MANILA BULLETIN)
This was disclosed by Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, who added that, based on
the initial exchange of emails, the envoy told the city that their government has allowed its vaccine-maker to strike deals with any offshore buyers, aside from national governments.The local chief executive did not disclose the foreign government.
Last Thursday, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said the Philippines plans to procure vaccines from Sinovac Biotech of China, Oxford-AstraZeneca of United Kingdom, and Pfizer-BioNTech of the United States next year.
Duterte said the offer of vaccines directly to Davao City was a “positive” development because the previous communications the city had with another pharmaceutical company, which said that it will only sell its COVID-19 vaccines to the Department of Health (DOH).“An official from another country listened to our radio broadcast and then they already reached out to us and there were initial exchanges of emails already. This is very positive because according to them they are allowed by their country to sell to whoever is the buyer,” she said.However, Duterte added that they have yet to ascertain if the national government would allow a local government unit to buy directly from vaccine-makers.
Citing the envoy, Duterte said: “We do not know if you need the permission of the DOH to buy from us.”
Duterte said that the government has yet to give the EUA to any vaccine.
“We are waiting for that document also so that we will know what brand of vaccines will be given with the EUA by our national government so we can pursue them. But, as of now, we are not waiting for that because we are already seeking out company… if they will say ‘no,’ we will lose nothing because we are already in the middle of this pandemic. That is why, we are trying to reach out and talk and ask what are the possibilities available for LGU,” she said.
Duterte added that another vaccine-maker could provide vaccines to the city if it could participate in the phase 3 of the clinical trials.
“The only way to access, as of now, if we participate in clinical trials. Their advice to us was to write a letter and request that Davao City will be included in a clinical trial so that we can access the vaccines for our plans of voluntary vaccination for health and non-health frontliners,” she added.Davao City reverted to general community quarantine (GCQ) from modified GCQ last November 20, which was expected to last until 30, but has since been extended until the end of this year.
As of December 10, Department of Health-Davao reported a total of 10,520 cases in the region, with 2,459 active, 7,651 recoveries, and 410 deaths.Of the total cases, Davao City reported 7,369, Davao de Oro with 483, Davao del Norte with 1,284, Davao del Sur with 784, Davao Occidental with 122, and Davao Oriental with 478.

Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca’s Russian branch said Friday it would use part of Russia’s homemade Sputnik V vaccine in further clinical trials, a major sign of recognition for a jab that has been viewed with scepticism by the West.(Photo by NELSON ALMEIDA / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Russia was one of the first countries to announce the development of a coronavirus vaccine, which it named Sputnik V after the Soviet era satellite.
While the jab is yet to complete its third and final phase of testing involving some 40,000 volunteers, its developers have said that interim trial results showed 95 percent efficacy.
“Today we announce a clinical trial programme to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a combination of AZD1222, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and Sputnik V, developed by Russian Gamaleya Research institute,” AstraZeneca said in a statement published on its website in English and Russian on Friday.
The pharmaceutical company said that adults aged 18 and over will be enrolled in the trials, expected to start before the end of the year.
While the Sputnik V jab uses human adenovirus vectors, AZD1222 relies on adenovirus from chimpanzees. Both are administered in two doses.
Russia’s Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which was involved in the development of Sputnik V, said in its own statement on Friday that on November 23 it offered AstraZeneca “to use one of the two vectors of the Sputnik V vaccine in additional clinical trials of its own vaccine”.Moscow announced the registration of Sputnik V back in August, after it had completed the second phase of trials on under 100 volunteers, raising concerns from scientists at home and abroad.Analysts viewed the fast-track registration and the early launch of mass vaccination as an effort for Russia to bolster its geopolitical influence.Several Russian allies — including India, Venezuela and Belarus — have said they would take part in clinical trials for the jab, while Kremlin-friendly governments have pre-ordered more than a billion doses of Sputnik V.Ignoring accusations by Britain of Russian-linked hackers targeting vaccine research, Moscow has said it is open to cooperation with Western countries.
The vaccine’s developers said it will be available on international markets for less than $10 (8.40 euros) per dose — and that it can be stored at between two and eight degrees Celsius (between 35.6 and 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit) instead of the temperatures far below freezing required for some other vaccines.
‘Unique example of cooperation’
In its statement on Friday, AstraZeneca said that “combinations of different COVID-19 vaccines may be an important step in generating wider protection through a stronger immune response and better accessibility.”
The British-Swedish drugmaker added that cooperation with the Gamaleya Research Institute is “important to explore the potential of vaccine combinations unlocking synergies in protection and accessibility through a portfolio approach.”
The pharmaceutical giant had earlier said that its vaccine was on average 70 percent effective.Head of RDIF Kirill Dmitriyev said on Friday that the collaboration will be a “unique example of cooperation between scientists from different countries in jointly fighting coronavirus”.While Russia’s second wave has continued to surge in recent weeks, the country has refrained from reimposing a strict nationwide lockdown as it did in the spring and pinned its hopes on mass vaccination.Last week Russia started a large-scale public vaccination drive, offering Sputnik V initially to people in high-risk groups including medical workers and teachers.On Friday it reported 613 virus deaths over the past 24 hours, surpassing the 600 mark for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic.
Total fatalities stood at 45,893, while infections jumped to 2,597,711, placing Russia’s caseload fourth-highest in the world.Russia has reported a much lower death rate than other badly hit countries, raising concerns that authorities have downplayed the outbreak.
Data published by the country’s federal statistics service on Thursday indicated excess deaths of nearly 165,000 year-on-year between March and October, suggesting virus deaths could be much higher. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

They said they have enough data already,” Domingo said in a text message.
To note, Astrazeneca has applied to hold Phase III clinical trials in the country.

France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GSK said Friday their Covid-19 vaccines will not be ready until the end of 2021, after interim results showed a low immune response in older adults.

(Photo by JOEL SAGET / AFP)
The announcement is a huge setback in efforts to fight the pandemic, which first emerged in China last December and has killed over 1.5 million people worldwide.
Sanofi and GSK said the delay in their adjuvanted recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine programme was to “improve immune response in older adults.”
The vaccine’s potential availability had been pushed back “from mid-2021 to Q4 2021,” they said in a statement.
American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have said their vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.
US experts voted Thursday to recommend granting emergency approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, paving the way for America to become the next country to move ahead with mass immunisation after the UK. Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have also approved it.
The Sanofi-GSK candidate is based on technology that Sanofi has used to produce seasonal influenza vaccines and on immunological agents developed by GSK.“Phase 1/2 study interim results showed an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a low immune response in older adults likely due to an insufficient concentration of the antigen,” the statement said.
It said a recent study in non-human primates using an improved antigen formulation demonstrated that the candidate could “protect against lung pathology and lead to rapid viral clearance from the nasal passages and lungs, within 2 to 4 days.”“These results increase the companies’ confidence in the capacity of the adjuvanted recombinant platform to deliver a highly efficient vaccine for all adults,” it said.The hunt for a vaccine brings up questions like whether unexpected safety issues may arise when the number of people vaccinated grows to millions and possibly billions of people.
– ‘More than one vaccine needed’ –
Also unknown is whether more side effects will emerge, how long the vaccine remains effective, whether it will limit transmission and how it will work in children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients.
“We care greatly about public health which is why we are disappointed by the delay announced today, but all our decisions are and will always be driven by science and data,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Head of Sanofi Pasteur.
“We have identified the path forward and remain confident and committed to bringing a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine,” he said.
“There is no question of abandoning the vaccine,” he told AFP.Both Russia and China have already begun inoculation campaigns with domestically produced vaccines despite far less vetting, while several other vaccines are being developed in the West.
Japan has formalised a deal with UK drugmaker AstraZeneca to receive 120 million doses of its coronavirus vaccines, the health ministry said Friday.Tokyo has also secured Covid-19 vaccines for 60 million people from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and for a further 25 million people from biotech firm Moderna. Vaccination could start as early as March 2021, Kyodo News agency reported this week.
“No single pharma company can make it alone; the world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic,” Triomphe said.
Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added: “The results of the study are not as we hoped. Based on previous experience and other collaborations, we are confident that GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system, when coupled with a COVID-19 antigen, can elicit a robust immune response.”
The companies plan a Phase 2b study expected to start in February. If the data is positive, a global Phase 3 study could start in the second quarter of next year.
“Positive results from this study would lead to regulatory submissions in the second half of 2021, hence delaying the vaccine’s potential availability from mid-2021 to Q4 2021,” the statement said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Development of a Covid-19 vaccine in Australia was abandoned Friday after clinical trials produced a false positive HIV result among subjects involved in early-stage testing.
The result prompted the government to axe plans to purchase millions of doses of the candidate vaccine and instead increase orders of alternatives from AstraZeneca and Novax, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.
“The University of Queensland vaccine will not be able to proceed based on the scientific advice, and that will no longer feature as part of Australia’s vaccine plan,” Morrison said.The candidate vaccine, which was still in phase one trials at the University of Queensland, used a small amount of HIV protein as a “molecular clamp” but triggered an antibody response that could interfere with HIV screening, Health Minister Greg Hunt said.
Although the vaccine had proved promising at suppressing Covid-19 and there was no chance of HIV transmission, development was abandoned over fears it could undermine public confidence in vaccinations, Department of Health Secretary Brendan Murphy said.
“It probably would have worked very well as a vaccine, but we can’t have any issues with confidence,” Murphy said.
Professor Paul Young from the University of Queensland insisted that the HIV protein used in the vaccine was “completely harmless” and posed no health risk to those who took part in trials.
The government said the announcement did not change the planned roll-out of other vaccines to begin in March.
With Australia recording only a small number of infections daily, the government said it could afford to take a relatively cautious approach to vaccines in comparison to countries with large outbreaks.
Australia has recorded 28,000 cases of Covid-19 in a population of 25 million, with around 900 deaths.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon on Friday likened the P72.5-billion fund earmarked for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines to an unfunded check.
Senator Franklin Drilon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
Drilon disclosed his assessment as he reiterated his concerns about the lack of a definite source of funds to immunize around 60 million Filipinos next year.
Under the proposed P4.5-trillion national budget for 2021, which Congress ratified last Thursday, only P72.5-billion has been allocated by the government for the purchase of the coronavirus vaccines. Of the amount, only P2.5-billion has “solid funding.”The remaining P70-billion is in the unprogrammed fund – the funding for which depends on approved loans or once the government exceeds its non-tax revenues targets.
“There is a global race to buy the vaccine,” Drilon said in a statement.
“It is unfortunate that in these uncertain times, the budget is creating additional uncertainty. This makes Filipinos wary about the future,” he stressed.
“It is like we issue a check without adequate funding. Sana po hindi mag-bounce,” he further quipped.Drilon further pointed out that the Philippines health care system “at this stage is a big question mark to me because of the very fluid plans for the acquisition, funding of the vaccine and the logistical expense that goes with it.
“No definite revenue source is identified…The comfort level is not very high that we can achieve a certain degree of confidence insofar as our public health is concerned,” he further said.
“I guess we just have to look up at the sky and pray,” he said.Drilon said he is disappointed that the government did not retrieve around P33-billion funds parked and sitting idly in the Philippine International Trading Center (PITC) which could have helped the government vaccinate at least half of the 60 million Filipinos.
Then there is also the P16.4-billion fund for anti-insurgency and P9.5-billion for confidential and intelligence funds which, Drilon said, could have augmented the government’s need for additional funding for COVID-19 vaccines.
“Talking about misplaced priorities. There is no definite revenue source for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccine but there are P16.4 billion for anti-insurgency and P9.5 billion for confidential and intelligence funds,” Drilon lamented.
“There are around 2.7 million Filipino families slipped into poverty due to Covid-19 and, yet, there is no allocation for social amelioration program for next year,” he added.
“We do not have a definite source of funds to support the additional P70-billion for the vaccine but we let over P33 billion funds parked and sitting idly in the Philippine International Trading Center (PITC),” said Drilon.Drilon further bewailed how the Filipino people are being kept in the dark about the vaccine rollout.
“Where is the vaccine roadmap? Where’s the plan? The lack of a clear roadmap adds to the worries of Filipinos about the future of our country insofar as our ability to fight the pandemic,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Importation of critical medical medicines, including vaccines, are exempted from value added tax under the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act starting January 1, 2021, according to Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon M. Lopez.
Lopez said at the Health and the Economic Outlook for 2020 virtual forum the exemption is in view of the ongoing health crisis. “The coverage of VAT-exempt transactions under CREATE has been expanded to cover drugs and medicines for cancer, mental illness, tuberculosis, and kidney diseases beginning January 1, 2021,” said Lopez, who expressed hope that the legislative measure will be signed by President Duterte within this month of December.
Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon M. Lopez
In addition, under CREATE, export enterprises and domestic enterprises engaged in activities classified as critical industries will enjoy an Income Tax Holiday for 4 to 7 years. There will also be a 5 percent Special Corporate Income Tax Rate (SCIT) based on Gross Income Earned, in lieu of all national and local taxes for 10 years.He said the Board of Investments will formulate the Strategic Investment Priorities Plan (SIPP), which will define the coverage of the sectoral tiers and provide the conditions for qualifying economic activities. This will give premium to projects or activities that have substantial amounts of investments, considerable job generation capacity, and modern technology.
It was also his understanding that COVID-19 coming from members of the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) has also zero duty.
Aside from CREATE, the signing of RCEP among ASEAN member states, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, and China will offer trade and investment opportunities for the Philippine manufacturing sector.
Specifically, he said RCEP will benefit the Philippines in four key areas: cheaper costs, convenience, competitiveness, and complementation.With regard to cheaper cost, it is expected that the RCEP will increase the movement
of goods throughout the region. With regard to Convenience, our MSMEs and exporters can engage in seamless transactions through RCEP for all Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners.
On competitiveness, Lopez said that RCEP presents a more stable and predictable business environment that is expected to attract more investments in the Philippines.With regard to Complementation, RCEP supports MSME development and participation
in global value chains.
For instance, in terms of enhanced market access for goods, many of the country’s local products will enjoy significant tariff concessions to enter China, Japan, and Korea. For instance, within the next 10 to 20 years or less, depending on the product, preserved pineapple and car head lights will enter China at 0% tariff; chocolate products and canned fruit juice can be exported to Japan also at 0%; and fresh papaya, beer, and bicycle products can enter Korea at 0%.
“We look forward to maximizing the opportunities presented by CREATE and RCEP in the years
ahead,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

THE HAGUE/WASHINGTON – Documents related to the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine were illegally accessed during a cyberattack at the EU regulator, the company said Wednesday, as the United States registered more than 3,000 deaths in 24 hours and Germany and other northern hemisphere countries grappled with a winter surge in the pandemic.
(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
The Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) reported the cyberattack as European countries eagerly await a vaccine, including Germany where Chancellor Angela Merkel is pushing for tougher action against a second wave of COVID-19 that is proving deadlier than the first there.
While the EMA did not give details on the attack, Pfizer and BioNTech said documents relating to their vaccine candidate had been accessed, but that ”no systems have been breached in connection with this incident.”The EMA has promised to reach a decision on conditional approval for Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine by December 29, with a ruling on Moderna’s version to follow by January 12.
Those with severe allergy should avoid Pfizer shot
People with a significant history of allergies should not currently receive the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, the UK’s National Health Service said, after two people experienced reactions from the shots.
The warning came a day after the UK became the first western nation to begin a COVID vaccination program, following approval of the shot last week by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Thousands of people received vaccinations on Tuesday, according to the NHS.
“As is common with new vaccines, the MHRA have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination,” Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said in a statement.June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said her team looked at two case reports of allergic reactions on Tuesday evening.
Both of the people, staff members of the NHS, are recovering well.
“We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature, that if we need to strengthen our advice now that we’ve had this experience in the vulnerable populations, we get that advice to the field immediately,” Raine told a panel of lawmakers.Pfizer and BioNTech said they’re supporting the MHRA in its investigation.
The UK agency had already warned in its prescribing information that people who are allergic to any ingredients in the vaccine shouldn’t take it.
Patients with a history of severe adverse reactions to a vaccine or severe allergic reactions to any component of the treatment were excluded from participating in the large study run by the companies before approval.
“In the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial, this vaccine was generally well tolerated with no serious safety concerns reported by the independent data monitoring committee,” the companies said in a statement.
Canada on Wednesday became the latest nation to approve the Pfizer- BioNTech vaccine, a day after Britain gave out the first approved vaccine jabs in the Western world.The United States is expected to follow suit within days, after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel meets on the issue Thursday.
Secretary of Defense Chris Miller and his top generals will be vaccinated for COVID-19 by next week after the expected approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Pentagon officials said Wednesday.
Miller, Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist, Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley and Vice Chairman General John Hyten, and Joint Chiefs Senior Enlisted Advisor Ramon Colon-Lopez will be first in line for vaccinations to protect the US military’s command structure, said Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Thomas McCaffery.
The Pentagon will get an initial 44,000 doses of Pfizer’s treatment, which could gain final approval from the Food and Drug Administration as early as late Thursday, he said.
The final step will be a review scheduled for Sunday by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
”We are confident within 24 to 48 hours from that advisory committee decision, we will actually have shots in arms,” said Lieutenant General Ronald Place, director of the Defense Health Agency.
But a top government scientist said the FDA would probably ask
people with a known history of severe allergies not to take it — after two health care workers in Britain needed treatment for allergic reactions.
The cyberattack comes after Britain accused Kremlin-linked hackers in July of targeting labs researching coronavirus vaccines and after a US newspaper reported that cyber-criminals had tried to attack several pharmaceutical firms developing vaccines.
They included Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, AstraZeneca and South Korean laboratories.
Both Russia and China have already begun inoculation campaigns with domestically produced vaccines.
The Russian space agency said on Wednesday it planned to offer the Sputnik coronavirus vaccine to cosmonauts but insisted it would be on a voluntary basis.
Israel accepted its first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promising to be the first to be injected — although the vaccine has yet to pass regulatory hurdles there.
”What is important to me is that Israeli citizens get vaccinated,” he said. ”I want to serve as an example to them.”
AU Commission chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat meanwhile said Wednesday that Africa must be among the first beneficiaries of the vaccines, adding that ”those who have the (financial) means must not monopolize the vaccines.”
South Africa, the country most affected by the coronavirus on the continent, has entered a second wave of the pandemic, the health minister declared Wednesday.
”This evening we wish to announce that as South Africa we are now experiencing a second wave,” said Zweli Mkhize in a statement as the country registered nearly 7,000 new cases in the last 24-hour cycle.
The virus has now killed more than 1.5 million worldwide since it emerged in China late last year.
900,000-strong petition on COVID patents
The World Trade Organization said Wednesday it had received a 900,000-
signatory petition calling for patents to be lifted on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.
The virtual petition, organized by the global citizen activism group Avaaz, was submitted ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the Council for Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).
WTO member states were set to continue talks on proposals to waive certain TRIPS obligations concerning the prevention, containment or treatment of COVID-19.
”Considerable differences remain between members over this proposal,” the Geneva-based global trade body said.
The petition is addressed to all governments, WTO members and pharmaceutical companies.
“We call on you to urgently ensure access to lifesaving Covid-19 vaccines, treatments and equipment for everyone in the world,” it reads.
”Patents should be lifted, technological knowledge shared freely and openly, and no profiteering allowed during this pandemic.
”Governments, scientists and pharmaceutical companies must cooperate and combine resources to ensure no one is left behind. The pandemic will not be over until it’s over everywhere.”
Change ‘for the better’
In Germany, where the daily death toll hit a new high of 590 on Wednesday, Merkel urged regions to take more drastic action to curb the virus spread, after state leaders agreed to ease what are already comparatively modest social restrictions for the Christmas holidays.
Merkel has been in no mood for celebration, repeatedly urging regional leaders who have responsibility for health policies to clamp down more strongly.
”If we have too many contacts before Christmas and it ends up being the last Christmas with the grandparents, then we’d really have failed,” she said.
Two weeks ago, Germany’s states agreed rules limiting social mixing to five people but agreed to double the limit to 10 for the holiday season —something Merkel argued against.
First doses in NY this weekend
New York is expected to receive its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as this weekend, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday.
Cuomo said he expected the US Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech jab on Thursday, paving the way for delivery.

San Juan City has allocated P50 million for the procurement of vaccines against COVID-19.
The City Council recently passed Ordinance No. 75, Series of 2020 appropriating the funds for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines “and other related activities.”
“One of the biggest game changers in our fight against COVID-19 is the vaccine. Our City Council has passed an ordinance allocating P50 million for it,” Mayor Francis Zamora said.Ordinance opposed
However, the measure was not unanimously approved by the City Council as two councilors, Jannah Ejercito and Franchesco Paul Velasco, opposed the passing of the ordinance.
“Hindi sila bumoto pabor dito. Nakalagay sa actual signed ordinance na they voted against it (They did not vote in favor of it. It is stated in the actual signed ordinance that they voted against it),” said the mayor.
“That means they voted against allocating P50 million for COVID-19 vaccines for San Juaneños—these vaccines will protect our people from COVID-19 and they voted against the P50 million funding for this.”Councilors explain vote
In a phone interview, Ejercito said that she is in favor of purchasing the vaccine. However, she explained that they cannot approve an ordinance allocating funds for procurement of a vaccine that is not yet ready.
“As for the vaccine, we are all for it. The problem is, how can you appropriate funds for something that is not yet ready?,” Ejercito told the Manila Bulletin on Thursday.“Pag ready na po ang vaccine kahit 300 million pa yan ay siempre pipirma kami ni Councilor Chesco kasi para sa tao ‘yun (When the vaccine is ready, even if it is worth P300 million, of course Councilor Chesco and I will sign the measure because it is for the people).”
‘Unspecified’ COVID-related activities questioned
Ejercito also questioned the “other related activities” clause on the measure, noting that such must be specified in order to determine where the allocated funds will go.
“All funds must be clearly specified what it is for. Transparency is very important so that everyone would know how the funds were used. We cannot allocate funds for something that what we do not specifically know where the money goes),” she said in a separate Facebook post.
“You cannot also procure a vaccine before it is approved. So when the vaccine is approved, and a price is identified, then the City Council will still pass an ordinance realigning a portion of the 2021 budget to fund the procurement. So this ordinance is just ‘pa-pogi,’” she added.For his part, Velasco echoed the concerns raised by Ejercito, saying that they cannot approve funds for a vaccine that is still in the testing process and has yet to be approved.
“Lilinawin ko po na base po sa ating batas hindi po tayo pwede mag-approve ng isang budget para sa isang bagay na hindi pa nag-eexist (I will clarify that based on our laws, we cannot approve a budget for something that does not yet exist),” Velasco said in Facebook post.
“Dahil sa panahon na prinopose at in-approve ang budget for COVID-19 vaccine ay kasalukuyan pa lamang pong ginagawa ito at tinitest ng ibat ibang kumpanya at scientists sa buong mundo (The budget for the COVID-19 vaccine was developed and approved while it is still being done and tested by various companies and scientists around the world),” he added.
The ordinance has been approved by the City Council on October 5. During that time, the vaccines developed by various pharmaceutical companies worldwide were still under the final stages of clinical trials. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Malacañang is confident that no drug manufacturer can bribe its way into the Philippines as the country works on acquiring COVID-19 vaccines.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque (OPS / MANILA BULLETIN)
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement after a Washington Post report said court records show that Sinovac, a Chinese firm applying to run COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines, acknowledged a bribery case involving its CEO.
Its CEO was also said to have bribed China’s drug regulator for vaccine approval in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The CEO said he could not refuse the official who demanded money.In his Thursday presser, Roque expressed confidence that Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officer-in-charge Enrique Domingo will not allow such things to happen in the Philippines.
“Buong-buo po ang tiwala ni Presidente kay (President Duterte has full trust in) Dr. Domingo,” he said.
“So pagdating po diyan sa mga allegations on bribery, tingin ko po hindi ‘yan mangyayari sa Pilipinas (when it comes to bribery allegations, I think that will not happen in the Philippines),” he added.
Roque reiterated that the Philippines will only allow safe and effective vaccines in the Philippines.“Consistent po tayo na papayagan lang nating magamit ang mga bakuna na napatunayang ligtas at mabisa laban sa COVID-19 (We are consistent that we will only approve vaccines that are safe and effective against COVID-19 to be used in the country),” he added.
This week, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that his department is aware of the report.
“This will also form part of the work of the vaccine expert panel. They will assess the veracity first and foremost of such a report,” he said in a virtual briefing.Sinovac is one of China’s two COVID-19 vaccine frontrunners. Its clinical testing is in the same final stage as the vaccine developed by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Two COVID-19 vaccine developers have been endorsed to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to conduct clinical trials in the country.
In a “Laging Handa” press briefing Thursday, Department of Science and Technology (DoST) Secretary Fortunato dela Pena revealed that Chinese pharmaceutical companies Sinovac Biotech and Clover Biopharmaceuticals already have vaccine evaluation and ethics approval.
(NOEL CELIS / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)
“Ang sistema kasi diyan basta naiendorse na namin ‘yung mga vaccines na nagdaan na sa vaccine evaluation at saka sa ethics approval, ang FDA na ngayon ang magdedecide kung approved or hindi (The process here is that once we endorse the vaccines that went through the vaccine evaluation and ethics approval, it will be up to FDA to approve or not),” he said.“How long it will take, FDA ang nakakaalam niyan (only FDA knows),” he added.
On the other hand, Jansen and AstraZeneca have ethics clearance and are just waiting for the vaccine evaluation to finish.
Dela Pena is letting the DoH probe Sinovac, following claims of bribery against them.
“As far as the evaluation, we rely on the data that were submitted to us and that will be one of the bases for the decision whether they would be given approval for conducting clinical trials by the FDA,” Dela Pena said.Department of Health (DoH) Secretary Francisco Duque III had earlier said that they will look into the bribery claims against Sinovac, citing a Dec. 4 report from US-based Washington Post, saying that the Chinese pharmaceutical company has a court record that shows “bribing China’s drug regulator for vaccine approvals.”
Dela Pea said the country is prepared and that they are just awaiting the announcement from the World Health Organization on what vaccines will be used during the Solidarity Trials and when it will be released. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sen. Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara assured Thursday that the P70-billion unprogrammed budget for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines that Congress allocated under the proposed P4.5-trillion national budget for 2021 can be considered “solid funding.”
Sen. Sonny Angara (Joseph Vidal/ Senate PRIB)
Angara made this assurance following concerns of other lawmakers that only P2.5-billion of the P72.5-billion allocated for the purchase of the vaccines has immediate funding, while the bulk of the funds will be lodged as standby funds.
“The P70-billion is solid funding also, and just because it’s under the unprogrammed funds doesn’t mean it’s not solid funding,” Angara said in an ANC interview.Angara explained these funds are not dependent just on tax collections.
“In fact, it’s not tax collections. It’s non-tax collections or non-fiscal collections so meaning that’s the fees you collect like at the LTO (Land Transportation Office) and things like that, the fees the treasury collects on interests,” he said.
Angara also said that the country’s economic managers themselves have, likewise, assured that the P70-billion budget is “very reachable.”
But if the government is able to buy a vaccine priced at P600, Angara said an estimated 100 million Filipinos and more can be vaccinated against the coronavirus.That is because, he said, on top of the P72.5-billion for the vaccines under the budget, an additional P10-billion will be funded under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act or Bayanihan 2.
“So if you add that to the P72.5-billion here in the 2021 budget, you are talking about P82.5 billion, and if you are talking about a vaccine that you can obtain at around P600, you are talking about over 100 million persons getting vaccinated,” Angara said.
Such budget, he said, “would seem sufficient,” but certain variables may play in the procurement.“There are questions that you and I cannot decide or solve because we don’t have the available information. What are these pieces of information? How much has been promised to us as supply? When will it arrive? Things like that. Where will it be stored?” he said.
“These are things that are all moving targets because there are so many factors at play. All governments of the world are talking to the vaccine manufacturers, trying to obtain adequate supply,” he said.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. had earlier said that the government hopes to vaccinate 60 to 70 percent of Filipinos against COVID-19. According to Galvez, such percentage is enough to trigger herd immunity within three to five years.
Thus, Angara said the proposed budget for the vaccines could be enough to meet this target.
“If we are looking at the indicative figure of 60 percent – I think that was the figure discussed, 60 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated – then I think there are sufficient funds there,” he noted.Sen. Pia Cayetano, vice chairperson of the Senate Committee on Finance, assured Wednesday that the panel took into consideration the prices of the COVID-19 vaccines the government will procure before they pass the 2021 national budget measure.
“As (it was) correctly pointed out, the vaccines range in prices, anywhere from P610, that is the AstraZeneca brand, for the two doses, that is the cheapest,” Cayetano manifested during the Senate plenary session.
She said the most expensive vaccine is by Sinopharm priced at P8,845 for two doses. Next was Moderna’s at P4,500 each.
“So, let’s just use the P610 one, which is the cheapest. Let me first point out that time and again, the IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force) and also DoH (Department of Health) told us that the objective really is to get from different brands,” Cayetano said.
But the biggest issue, she pointed out, is the country’s access to the vaccines.
“So inasmuch as WHO (World Health Organization) states that 60 to 70 percent of the population should be vaccinated for herd immunity, the question is how soon can we access vaccines to cover the 60-70 percent?”
“And I think the best target that I heard, this may have changed, I agree with everyone that it is fluid. The closest we might be able to get is 25 percent,” Cayetano said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Canada on Wednesday approved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, days after Britain became the first country to greenlight and roll it out.
“At last we have a reason to feel optimistic and excited about returning to the lives we led pre-Covid,” Canadian deputy chief public health officer Howard Njoo told a news conference, adding that Ottawa was “bringing vaccines to Canadians earlier than hoped.”
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a tweet called the announcement good news, but warned: “It doesn’t mean we can let our guards down” against the spread of the Covid-19 illness as a second wave forced several regions to reintroduce restrictions.The government’s chief medical advisor Supriya Sharma said the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot “marks a critical milestone in our efforts to bring Covid-19 under control.”
She said additional vaccines would become available and be rolled out throughout 2021, with three other vaccine candidates — including one developed by US-based Moderna, which could be delivered later this month — currently being evaluated by health authorities.
These, she said, will provide “every Canadian with the opportunity to be immunized.”
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had undergone a fast-tracked review while it was still in clinical trials, which concluded that it met “stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements for use in Canada,” said the country’s health department, Health Canada.The Gulf kingdom of Bahrain has also approved the vaccine.
Marc Berthiaume, director of Health Canada’s bureau of medical science, said its evaluation found “strong evidence that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.”
The regulator advised, however, that it should be used only in people 16 years of age and up, for now.Canada had pre-ordered 20 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine when it was still in development, with an option for 56 million additional doses.
Trudeau said on Monday that as many as 249,000 doses would be received in December.
The first shipments to 14 sites across Canada are scheduled to arrive Monday with people receiving shots a day or two later, according to Major-General Dany Fortin, a war-hardened commander put in charge of coordinating distribution.
Health care workers and vulnerable populations including the elderly are to be the first to receive it.
– 95 percent effective –
The federal government concluded pre-orders with several other pharmaceutical companies — including AstraZeneca, Sanofi and GSK, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson, Medicago and Moderna — for a total of 400 million doses, to ensure it eventually gets what it needs for its population of 38 million.By September 2021, Trudeau said, most Canadians should be inoculated.
Thousands of Britons became the first in the Western world to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Tuesday at the start of the biggest global vaccination drive in more than half a century.
The vaccine — which proved to be 95 percent effective in late-stage clinical trials — is administered in two doses, 21 days apart.
British health officials, however, warned on Wednesday that anyone with a history of significant allergic reactions should not get it right away, after two people suffered allergic reactions and needed treatment.
Canadian authorities also advised people with allergies to the vaccine ingredients specifically to also hold off as they investigate.US giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech called Canada’s interim order for its emergency use “a historic moment in our collective fight against the Covid-19 pandemic” and “a major step towards returning to normalcy in Canada.”
They will continue providing data on its use for ongoing evaluation, said Health Canada.
Fortin said the distribution of the vaccine — which must be stored in extreme sub-zero temperatures — will be a “mobilization effort of massive proportion.”
He and his team have been doing a “dry run” to test the ultra-cold storage delivery chain, flying boxes from Belgium and handing them off to health care workers.
On Friday, a full dress rehearsal is planned to firm up the responsibilities of each person in the chain.
“Never in modern memory have we seen such an unprecedented level of collaboration or cooperation,” Fortin said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“Great to see Matron May Parsons, originally from the Philippines, deliver the world’s first vaccine shot. Our NHS (National Health Service) is proud to have such dedicated health worker,” Nigel Adams, Minister of State for Asia at the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, said in a tweet on Tuesday.In another tweet, British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce described as a “fantastic moment” the historic first anti-COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine injected by Parsons to Margaret Keena, a grandmother of four, during the pilot launch in the United Kingdom.“A fantastic moment! And great to see that the vaccine is administered by Nurse May Parsons from the Philippines – one of the many thousands of Filipino healthcare workers making such an enormous contribution to the NHS (National Health Service),” Pruce said.In a photo released by the British news platform Sky News, Parsons was shown injecting Keenan with Pfizer/BioNTech-made vaccine, the first to be given to someone outside a clinical trial.Parsons told the British media it was a “huge honor” to be the first in the country to deliver the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to a patient.
“The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel,” Parsons was quoted as telling Sky News.It was learned that Parsons has been working in the NHS sector for the last 24 years and connected at the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire since 2003.
Keenan, a grandmother of four, was administered with the vaccine at the city’s University Hospital at 6:31 a.m.
Last month, American drug maker Pfizer, together with its German partner BioNTech SE, released initial data on its vaccine that showed it to have an efficacy of more than 90 percent.It was followed by the British government’s authorization last week for the Pfizer vaccine’s emergency use, with older people getting the first shots of the injection.

“We are organizing early to ensure that the directions set by the national government will be followed, and that those who need the virus most are prioritized,” she added.Belmonte said the city government is now reviewing and finalizing the database of those in the priority list for inoculation.In line with national guidelines, health workers, senior citizens, indigent and vulnerable sectors, frontliners, essential workers, soldiers, policemen, uniformed personnel and business essential workers will be prioritized in the immunization plan.
The task force is also mandated to select and acquire the vaccine or vaccines authorized for use in the Philippines in coordination with the national government, based on effectiveness and practical considerations such as the vaccine’s storage, handling, equipment and training requirements.
It is authorized to secure direct supplies from the national government and will study the possibility of direct procurement under applicable laws, subject to the guidelines and approval of the national government. It may also enter into tripartite agreements among the supplier, the private sector and the City, if allowed by the government.
The task force is also responsible for the development and administration of a system for registering beneficiaries, tracking the distribution of doses and monitoring of any adverse events following immunization (AEFI).

The Senate version of the proposed P4.5 trillion General Appropriations Bill (GAB or national budget) includes an P83 billion allocation for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine.
(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
This was revealed today by Senator Grace Poe during a TV interview as chairmen of the Senate and House of Representatives bicameral conference committee panels are still attempting to iron out the differing provisions of their GAB versions.‘’So there’s quite a bit. Of course we still need more, but there’s P83 billion allotted for that. And then we also added for contact tracers. We put more, let’s say, for PCR testing and then P3 billion for PPEs (personal protective equipment), P4.5 billion for increasing hospital capacity. And then P13.5 billion for risk allowance of health workers,’’ she explained.
Poe said the P83 billion is an accumulation of the Senate’s ability to transfer funds from other departmentsto the vaccine purchase program because of their absorptive capacity problems, among others.
‘’And we need those frontliners, we need the response, we need the vaccine, we need the testing, and the PPEs, etc,’’ she said.
The House had a P5.5 billion appropriation for the purchase of vaccine based on its version of the budget.
Senator Panfilo M. Lacson, an anti-pork barrel advocate, earlier said that there are less than P400 billion ‘’lump sums’’ or re-appropriated sums embedded in the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) budget.Lump sum appropriations had been declared as illegal by the Supreme Court.
Poe also said the Senate also lopped off P49 billion from the proposed 2021 budget of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) of P143 billion based on the National Expenditure Program (NEP).The reason,according to Poe, is that DOTr has had a track record of having difficulty utilizing or absorbing their budget and actually spending it.
‘’We trimmed it down to about P94 billion. That’s how much we took out. And the reason is most of those projects that they lodged in the DOTr was for rail. And seeing the face of what they needed for that, and the demand on other things, like COVID response, we thought that the DOTr won’t be able to spend it anyway next year. All of that, so we moved it,’’ she explained. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

President Duterte is confident that the country’s purchase of COVID-19 vaccines will be free from corruption with vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. in charge.

In his public address Monday night, Duterte said he has full faith and confidence that there will be no kickbacks involved in the process of acquiring the vaccines because there will only be one person who will take care of it.
“They say that we would need about P73 billion to vaccinate the population. Iyan, teritoryo ‘yan ni (That’s the territory of) General Galvez. I have full faith and confidence that walang kickback-kickback ‘yan (that there will be no kickbacks involved),” he said.“Walang makikialam. Siya lang. Ang sinabi ko, siya lang ang kakana niyang vaccine para sa ating mga kababayan (Nobody will interfere. It’s just him. I told him that he’s the only one who will handle the vaccine for everybody),” he added.
Last month, President Duterte revealed that he named Galvez as the vaccine czar to lead the government’s acquisition and distribution of vaccines for COVID-19 after turning down the idea of having committees to deal with the procurement.
He likewise agreed to make advance payments to companies making the vaccine so the Philippines will not be left behind on the road to recovery from the pandemic. Duterte initially slammed western pharmaceutical companies for seeking what he called “reservation fees.”
The Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases had approved the national COVID-19 vaccine roadmap and formed a new cluster to implement the immunization program.
The President likewise allowed the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines in the country.
Two weeks ago, Malacañang assured the public that there will be no politics involved in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines as the government’s vaccination program is set to last a maximum of five years, covering the election year 2022.

(Photo by HANDOUT / INDONESIAN PRESIDENTIAL PALACE / AFP)
The doses arrived in Jakarta late Sunday on a flight from Beijing, with another 1.8 million expected to be sent again next month.
Although Chinese regulators have yet to clear any of country’s vaccines for mass distribution, they have approved some advanced candidates for emergency use.
On Monday, Indonesia’s Covid-19 response team chief Airlangga Hartarto said the first batch of doses will be examined by the food and drug agency, with plans to distribute them to medical workers and other high-risk groups.
The country’s top Muslim clerical body, the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI), will also check the first consignment, officials said — to ensure it meets halal requirements in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation.Late Sunday, President Joko Widodo welcomed the delivery.
“We are grateful that the vaccine is now available and we can immediately prevent the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak,” he said.
“(But) I have to reiterate, first, that all procedures must be followed properly to ensure public health and safety, and the efficacy of the vaccine,” he added.
In August, Indonesia launched human trials of the Sinovac-made jab, with around 1,600 volunteers taking part in the six-month study.
The Indonesian government has paid some 637 billion rupiah ($45 million) for the three million Sinovac doses. Another 100,000 more are set to be delivered by another Chinese firm, CanSino.China has promised to make its vaccines available as a “global public good” as it seeks to counter global criticism for its early handling of the pandemic.
“We expect that multilateral vaccines [from other countries] will also start to arrive gradually in 2021,” Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said Monday.
Indonesia has been in talks with other pharmaceutical firms, including UK-based AstraZeneca.
The country is one of the Asian nations worst hit by the pandemic, with Covid-19 infections topping 575,000, and more than 17,000 deaths.However, the true scale of the crisis is widely believed to be much bigger, as the country has one of the world’s lowest testing rates.

Beijing has largely brought the virus under control, with only 281 active cases still receiving treatment, according to official figures.
But it has promised to make its vaccines available as a “global public good” as it seeks to counter global criticism for its early handling of the pandemic.Sino Biopharmaceutical Limited, a Hong Kong-listed medical research firm, said on Monday that it will invest $515 million for the development and production of CoronaVac, one of Sinovac’s most advanced vaccine candidates.
Sinovac – one of China’s leading vaccine producers – said the funding will be used for the “further development, capacity expansion and manufacturing” of CoronaVac.
It added it hoped to be able to manufacture 600 million doses by the end of the year.
Sino Biopharmaceutical will receive a 15 percent share in a Sinovac subsidiary, Sinovac Life Sciences, under the agreement.
Although regulators have yet to approve China’s vaccines for mass distribution, the country has approved some advanced candidates for emergency use. Since July a range of people from state employees to international students have been given jabs.
CoronaVac is being tested in multiple countries including Brazil, where final-stage clinical trials for the jab have restarted after hitting a setback in November when a volunteer experienced an “adverse incident.”
The vaccine “has reached critical milestones in clinical trials in Asia and Latin America,” Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong said in the statement.
The company had earlier said almost all its employees and their families have voluntarily taken the vaccine.
Sinopharm, another Chinese vaccine maker, said in November that nearly a million people have already taken its experimental COVID-19 vaccine.
Last week Britain became the first Western country to approve a vaccine for general use, piling pressure on other countries to follow suit swiftly. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Around 24.6 million Filipinos, including frontline health workers, will be given priority in the government’s vaccination program to fight the new coronavirus disease, Malacañang announced Monday.
First on the government’s list of eligible groups will be the 1.76 million health workers from both public and private health facilities, according to presidential spokesman Harry Roque.
The list of “sectoral priorities” includes 3.78 million indigent senior citizens, 5.67 million remaining senior citizens, 12.91 million remaining indigent population, and 525,523 uniformed personnel.The total eligible recipients of the COVID-19 vaccine will be 24,668,128 or an estimated 22.8 percent of the country’s population, Roque said.
“Ang ating o-orderin ay mga 30 million good for – well, 30 million individuals or 60 million dosage (We will order vaccines for 30 million individuals or 60 million doses),” he said during a televised press briefing.
“Ang una sa listahan ang ating mga frontline health workers. Obviously kinakailangan na bigyan sila ng bakuna nang magawa nila ang kanilang katungkulan ng walang atubili. Sila ang nangunguna sa ating laban sa COVID-19. Natural lamang na sila ang mabigyan ng proteksyon laban sa virus (Our frontline health workers will be first on the list. Obviously, they should be given vaccines so they can continue their work without hesitation. They are our frontliners in the fight against COVID-19. It is natural they should be given protection against the virus),” he added.
Among the frontline health workers, Roque said, are those working in public and private hospitals and other medical facilities, public health workers and local government unit contact tracers, barangay health workers, and those assigned in national government agencies such as Department of Social Welfare and Development, Department of Education, Department of Interior and Local Government, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, and Bureau of Corrections.
Roque said the country’s senior citizens would be prioritized next since they belong to the group vulnerable to the coronavirus. “Sila ang madaling kapitan ng virus dahil mayroon silang comorbidities. At kapag kinapitan, alam natin na sang-ayon sa datos, marami talaga ang namamatay sa ating mga seniors (They are vulnerable to the virus because they have comorbidities. If infected,we knowbased on data that many senior die),” he said.
He said the country’s poor would also be vaccinated in line with the promise of President Duterte.
Citing information from vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., Roque said places with high coronavirus cases such as Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Davao will be the “geographical priorities” for the vaccination program.
Under the Department of Health’s plan, the government’s vaccination drive aims to reduce the country’s COVID fatality rate and substantially control transmission in the country.
The President had earlier promised to give free vaccines to the country’s poor and vulnerable population once the drugs become available. The government has already identified P73.2 billion in funding sources to bankroll the vaccine acquisition program.
With plans to inoculate 60 percent of the country’s population, Galvez had earlier said the government’s immunization plan may take three to five years depending on the supplies. The government is in talks with some vaccine suppliers to secure the country’s stock of the life-saving medicine. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

President Duterte is eager to take the coronavirus vaccine in the country to help boost public confidence in the immunization drive, Malacañang said today.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque recognized that the President remains the “best communication tool” to promote the government’s safe vaccination drive once local regulatory authorities give an approval of the drug.“Aang Presidente hindi na makaantay (The President can hardly wait),” Roque said during a televised press briefing.“Gusto niyang talagang turukan na siya nang mapakita nga po sa buong bayan na ligtas at epektibo, ito po’y dumaan sa expert panel group nang pinakadalubhasang Pilipino at iyan po ay comes with their highest endorsement na ligtas at epektibo (He wants to be vaccinated to show the entire nation that it is safe and effective, that it passed an expert panel group composed of Filipino experts, and comes with their highest endorsement of safety and efficacy),” he said.
Roque said it might be not necessary to make the President’s vaccination a live event. “Ginawa mo naman spectacle ang Presidente. Huwag naman siguro. Hindi kinakailangan na live ‘yan (You’ll turn the President into a spectacle. It’s not necessary to hold it live),” he said.
Nonetheless, Roque said it is still up to the President to make the decision on the matter, adding he won’t second guess Duterte.
Shortly after Russia announced regulatory approval of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine last August, the President accepted Moscow’s offer to supply the life-saving drug to the country and offered to take the first shot as a gesture of his trust and gratitude. He even expressed willingness to be vaccinated in public to allay any fears about the safety of the drug.Roque said the President’s readiness to take the coronavirus shot still stands.
“The President is the best communication tool. So kung papayagan na po ang FDA, I think mangunguna ang Presidente at nag-volunteer naman siya. In fact, gusting-gusto na niya. (If the FDA gives the approval, I think the President will be the first and he has volunteered. In fact, he really wants to),” he said.
On reports that Vice President Leni Robredo is also willing to be among the first to get the COVID-19 vaccine to show safety, Roque expressed hope that she will keep her word.“Nauna na si Presidente na magsabi na willing siya (The President is the first to say he is willing to be vaccinated). Let’s hope she can be a guinea pig,” he said.
With the recent breakthroughs in vaccine development, the government has already outlined plans for the vaccine acquisition and distribution once available in the market. Around P73 billion will be raised to pay for the vaccination of 60 million Filipinos.Among the priority beneficiaries of the free vaccines will be health frontliners, the poor, and uniformed personnel.
The President has also granted authority to the FDA director general to issue emergency use authorization for coronavirus vaccines and treatments. The emergency approval will accelerate the availability and use of such vaccines in the absence of available alternatives. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The government may reopen the country’s doors to foreign tourists once coronavirus vaccines become widely available, a Palace official said Monday.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said foreign tourists remain barred from entering the country for now.
Roque issued the pronouncement in the wake of persistent appeals from concerned groups to the government to further relax the country’s travel restrictions for foreigners, especially the fiancés of Filipinos seeking to enter the country.“Tapatan po para walang umaasa. Hanggang banned pa po ang tourist visas, I don’t think there can be a way for them to come in (Let’s be frank so there will be no expectations. As long as tourist visas are banned, I don’t think there can be a way for them to come in),” Roque said during a televised Palace press briefing.
Roque, however, asked concerned groups to be patient as he linked the government’s possible easing of travel ban on foreign tourists to the availability of coronavirus vaccines.
“Ang pag-asa na lang po natin ay may bakuna na. So, kapag may bakuna, baka puwede na tayo magbukas ng ating teritoryo muli sa mga turista. Antay na lang tayo. Sandali na lang ‘yan dahil narito na ang bakuna (Our only hope is the vaccine. Once the vaccine is there, maybe we can reopen our territory to tourists. Let’s wait. We’re getting there because the vaccine is here), ” he said.
Late last month, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Infectious Diseases (IATF) allowed foreign spouses of Filipinos and their children to enter the country starting December 7. The task force also gave the green light to the entry of former Filipino citizens, including their spouses and children, regardless of age, who are traveling with them.The government has required the travelers allowed visa-free entry to pre-book a quarantine facility and coronavirus test at an airport laboratory as a precaution against the illness. They will also be subject to the maximum capacity of inbound passengers at the port and date of entry.
Asked if the IATF policy on the entry of foreign spouse can be applied to married same-sex couples, Roque recognized that they should be covered.
“I would like to believe na basta mayroon silang marriage contract (as long as they have a marriage contract), they should be allowed in,” he said.“My professional view is you apply conflicts of law if it is valid, the marriage was valid in a jurisdiction where it was solemnized, then it should be recognized as valid here,” he added.
The government had earlier eased the travel restrictions on foreign businessmen and those employed in multinational companies and export processing zone enterprises in a bid to attract job-generating investments to revitalize the country’s economy. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

BATANG MAYNILA
Mayor Isko Moreno
Good news for all Batang Maynila.
In our own small way and through the help and support of my tireless vice mayor, Honey Lacuna, no Manilan, will spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day on an empty stomach. ‘Walang nganga,’ or so the street jargon goes.All families in Manila numbering about 650,000 will be receiving food packs that they can put atop their tables and share on the special days for us Filipinos.
As of this writing, these food packs may already be ready for distribution in the city’s various districts.
We may not be able to shoulder everything but at the very least, we in the city government would just like Manilans to know and feel that there is a city government at work and concerned about their welfare.
Knowing that all families have something to share and that no stomach will be empty on Christmas Day is enough to make us in the local government happy. If a family does not have any money, they can set aside maybe 70 percent of the food items and use them either on Christmas Eve or Day itself.Another good news that we have for Manilans is that we in the city government have already increased the budget allocation for the purchase of vaccines against COVID-19, the moment it becomes available in the market.
Once the opportunity arrives, these vaccines will be our gift for all Manilans and I thank Vice Mayor Honey and the city councilors for their help. This will be on top of what the national government is planning to do.
From the P200 million we allotted about four or five months ago, the budget is increased to P250 million after we decided to cancel road projects and realign the budget for vaccine purchase instead. Our priority is the health of the city’s population instead of good roads.Fortunately, yours truly happens to have connections with companies making the vaccines so that we were able to communicate with them as early as possible to ensure that we will be able to purchase vaccines as soon as they are certified by proper authorities.
Now, whatever protocols will be dictated by the DOH will be the same that will be used by the Manila Health Department to make sure that the public will not be kept in the dark or misguided. The message of the national government will be the message of the local government and our local barangays as well.
The city government will be creating an ID system and a website where those interested in availing of the vaccine will be given one, but only after a thorough scrutiny and study of his condition.
In order to give Manilans peace of mind and security that the vaccine is safe, I will have myself vaccinated.
Meanwhile, let me also take this opportunity to clarify that there will be no lockdowns anywhere in Manila at least until the end of the year, contrary to what had been coming out on social media.This will only happen if the residents will put their guards down,
become reckless, and cause COVID cases to shoot up and thus necessitate
a lockdown.
I call on the public to avoid believing everything they read on social media. Instead, go to my official social media account and my public announcements where everybody can get the correct information and may be guided properly.
Right now, the occupancy rate in our city’s total COVID beds is only 5 percent and thus, I call on all, particularly Manilans, to remain vigilant and extra cautious to keep the statistics low if not totally eradicate COVID cases in the city.
Truth is, I find it hard to sleep soundly at night for fear that our residents may suddenly let their guard down or become reckless in observing minimum health protocols, especially now that the government is slowly opening up the economy and allowing more people out of their homes.
Right now, all hope is still anchored on the public taking all the necessary precautions and following protocols to the letter at all times.

The country must be prepared to handle the storage of COVID-19 vaccines, House Deputy Speaker Surigao del Sur Rep. Johnny Pimentel said Sunday.
(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Pimentel underscored the need to keep such vaccines at low temperatures during storage or else their efficacy might get compromised.“The vaccination of an initial batch of 35 million Filipinos is bound to call for the mobilization of a wide-range of cold storage assets – from temperature-controlled refrigerated trucking services to ample supplies of dry ice. The logistical challenge is enormous, considering that everybody will need two shots of the vaccine at an interval of 19 to 42 days,” said Pimentel, a COVID-19 survivor.
He noted that the most promising COVID-19 vaccine is reputed to be 95 percent effective, but has to be stored in ultra-low temperature packed in dry ice.American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which jointly developed the vaccine with German biotech firm BioNTech SE, has designed distribution containers that can keep the shots at the required temperature of negative 70 degrees Celsius for 10 days if unopened.The distribution containers can also be used for temporary storage in a vaccination facility, such as a hospital, for up to 30 days as long as they are reloaded with dry ice every five days. Once thawed, the vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator at two to eight degrees Celsius for up to five days.As such, Pimentel said the COVID-19 immunization campaign in country will require the comprehensive listing of all available cold chain logistics solutions that can be marshaled to rapidly deploy the vaccines.“This early, we would expect our Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management ofEmerging Infectious Diseases to make an inventory of all obtainable cold storage provisions, including those held by private firms, that can be harnessed to deliver the vaccines across the country without delay,” he said.“We have to be geared up to cope, if we want to swiftly vaccinate millions of Filipinos, especially the most vulnerable ones such as our healthcare workers, those aged 65-years-old and above and those with underlying ailments,” added the solon, who also serves as Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) spokesman.At present, the Department of Health (DoH) has only one bulk cold storage facility at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa City.While the DoH has a long-term plan to put up regional cold storage warehouses as part of its modern supply chain for temperature-sensitive medical supplies, Pimentel expressed concern that the facilities may not be built in time for the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.“We may have to rely on cold chain solutions that are already available,” he said.The United Kingdom on Dec. 2 became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in a COVID-19 public inoculation program. The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to consider on Dec. 10 the possible approval of the same vaccine for emergency use in America. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Quezon City Rep. Precious Hipolito-Castelo has proposed that the country’s major airline companies be tapped in the transportation and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to the country.(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
The House Assistant Majority Leader said the government could seek the support of Philippine Airlines (PAL) and other domestic air carriers in transporting the vaccines.“I am assuming that we will get the vaccines from where they are being produced. Instead of foreign carriers, let us use local airlines to help them earn more at this time of pandemic so they would keep their employees,” she said in a statement.Noting that it would take more than 50 Boeing 777 freighters to fly 60 million doses to Manila, tapping foreign airlines in the transport of vaccines should also be considered in the event that the country’s air carriers fail to meet the requirements, the House leader said.
She noted that aside from PAL, other major domestic airlines such as AirAsia Philippines and Cebu Pacific could play a big role in the transportation of vaccines to the regions, provinces, cities, and towns.
“The government can help them avoid shedding more manpower if it can engage their services in the delivery of the vaccine,” she said.
Castelo also cited anew the need for the government to start preparing cold storage facilities for storing and safekeeping of COVID-19 vaccines in anticipation of their arrival and mass distribution to the Filipino people.She had earlier filed House Bill No. 8000 or the proposed “Vaccine-Ready Philippines Act of 2020” urging the government to amply prepare cold storage facilities for the vaccines.“Considering that our country is a populous nation and is an archipelago, a safe and effective mass distribution of the vaccine requires ample planning and preparation,” she said.
HB No. 8000 tasks the Department of Health (DoH) to determine the specifications of the cold storage facility necessary for the anticipated COVID-19 vaccines.
“DoH shall urgently prepare for the provision of cold storage facilities in accordance with the specifications that are suitable for safekeeping of the anticipated COVID-19 vaccines,” the measure provides.Citing some accounts, Castelo said vaccines can be stable for 30 days at temperatures ranging from two degrees to eight degrees Celsius.
“Establishing or finding safe storage facilities with such specification and standard in Metro Manila, the regions, and in provinces, cities, and towns will be a big challenge for the DoH,” she said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II will receive the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine within weeks, after UK regulators granted emergency approval and the world’s first roll-out begins next week, reports late Saturday said.

The monarch, 94, and her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip are in line to get the jab early due to their age and will not receive preferential treatment, the Mail on Sunday reported.
The newspaper said Britain’s most senior royals would reveal they have been given the inoculation “to encourage more people to take up the vital jab”, amid fears so-called anti-vaxxers could dent enthusiasm for it.Britain on Wednesday gave emergency approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, with health officials set to use criteria based on age and vulnerability to decide the order of people to receive it.
Elderly care home residents and their carers will be the very first to get inoculated, followed by those aged 80 and over and frontline health and care staff.
Other elderly people and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be next, with the rest of the population then prioritised by age.
Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Daily Mirror also reported a string of high-profile figures in Britain had committed publicly to getting the vaccine in a bid to boost take-up.
They include Monty Python star Michael Palin and Bob Geldof, the tabloid said.
Britain has pre-ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine in total, and is set to receive an initial batch of 800,000 to begin next week’s rollout.Regulators were forced to defend their world-first approval on Wednesday of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, insisting it met all safety standards after US and European officials queried the rapid process.
Meanwhile, plans are reportedly being stepped up to ensure any complications arising from the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31 do not impact its roll-out.
The vaccine will be manufactured at Pfizer’s plant in Puurs, Belgium, and needs to be transported in temperature-controlled thermal shippers that use dry ice.
The Observer reported late Saturday that ministers have drawn up contingency plans to fly millions of doses into Britain on military aircraft in the event of Brexit-related disruption at UK ports.
“We will do this if necessary,” a health department spokesperson told the newspaper.Talks to finalise a UK-EU free trade deal and avoid potential chaos in January are currently gridlocked, with just days left to seal an agreement. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Automaker Ford has ordered its own freezers while meat processing giant Smithfield said it is ready to put the cold room at its abattoirs at the disposal of vaccine roll-out operations.
Companies specializing in insulating containers have been on a war footing for weeks after Pfizer and BioNTech said the vaccine they had jointly developed needs to be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit (-70 Celsius).US logistics giant UPS is already producing 1100 lbs (500 kilos) of dry ice an hour in its depots and has developed portable freezers capable of storing the vaccines at temperatures of between -4 to -112 Fahrenheit.
But companies not directly linked to the manufacture, storage or transport of vaccines are also stepping up.
“We have assessed our ultra-low freezer capabilities and capacity and are ready and willing to assist health agencies if storage capacity becomes constrained,” said meat giant Smithfield’s chief administrative director, Keira Lombardo.
The meatpacker, which suffered a large number of cases of Covid-19 in some of its US slaughterhouses, said it now stands ready to help authorities distribute the vaccine, particularly to workers in the agricultural and food-supply sector, Lombardo said.For its part, Ford has ordered a dozen ultra-cold freezers in anticipation of the arrival of vaccines, to offer them to employees who want them when they are available.
When the virus began to spread in the spring in the United States, the company had to temporarily close its factories. The group has since resumed its activities but with strict health precautions.
“The health and safety of our workforce is our top priority,” a spokesman told AFP.
General Motors has not gone as far as procuring freezers but said it was in contact with US government agencies and health officials to “coordinate as needed when the distribution plans are made available.”
Meanwhile, US refrigerator manufacturer So-Low reported a “tremendous surge” in orders for its freezers that can maintain temperatures as low as -120 Fahrenheit.
The company, which supplies industry and research centers, was deluged with orders beginning in late September, sales manager Danny Hensler told AFP.
It has also seen a jump in demand for its freezers that get down to -22 Fahrenheit, suitable for storing the vaccine made by Moderna.
“We now have a backlog of orders to produce,” Hensler said. “Our employees are working overtime five days a week and we added Saturday to the production schedule.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan
(AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)
The WHO warned against complacency and what it said was an erroneous belief that because vaccines are on the near-horizon, the crisis is over.
“Vaccines do not equal zero Covid,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual news conference.“Vaccines and vaccination will add a major, major, powerful tool to the tool kit that we have. But by themselves, they will not do the job.”
Britain on Wednesday became the first Western country to approve a vaccine for general use, piling pressure on other countries to follow suit swiftly.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that progress on vaccines “gives us all a lift and we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
“However, WHO is concerned that there is a growing perception that the pandemic is over.“Many places are witnessing very high transmission of the virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers.”
Global coronavirus infections passed 65 million on Friday.
The novel coronavirus has killed at least 1.5 million people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.
‘Life and death’“The pandemic still has a long a way to run and decisions made by leaders and citizens in the coming days will determine both the course of the virus in the short term and when this pandemic will ultimately end,” said Tedros.
Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead, added that these decisions “can mean life and death for us, life and death for our family”.
According to the WHO’s overview of candidate vaccines, 51 are currently being tested on humans, 13 of which have reached final-stage mass testing.
A further 163 candidate vaccines are being developed in laboratories with a view to eventual human trials.
“I have seen vaccines transform the world and change the course of epidemics, and I fully expect that these vaccines and the ones that are to come will do that,” Ryan said.
But he warned that people needed to recognise that the vaccine “will not be with everyone early next year”.
Health workers, the elderly and people with underlying conditions will get priority — a choice that “will take a lot of the sorrow out of this pandemic. But it will not, by itself, end transmission,” said Ryan.
Tedros said he was happy to be vaccinated on camera to help promote public confidence, but would not jump the queue to do so.
“I would be happy to do it” but “I have to make sure it’s my turn”, he said.
Poor at risk of getting trampled
Meanwhile, Tedros warned Friday that the poor risk being “trampled” as wealthy nations roll out Covid-19 vaccines, which he said should be a public good.
Speaking at a virtual UN summit on the pandemic, Tedros said the world was seeing “light at the end of the tunnel” in the nearly year-long COVID crisis.
“But let me be clear. We simply cannot accept a world in which the poor and marginalized are trampled by the rich and powerful in the stampede for vaccines,” Tedros said.
“This is a global crisis and the solutions must be shared equitably as global public goods. Not as private commodities that widen inequalities and become yet another reason some people are left behind,” he said.
He also warned that the world has plenty of other challenges, saying: “There is no vaccine for poverty, no vaccine for hunger. There is no vaccine for inequality. There is no vaccine for climate change.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed news that US president-elect Joe Biden, and former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have said they will volunteer to get an approved vaccine on camera.
“It’s a good idea… I think it’s very good that they already have shown their commitment. They can influence,” he told reporters.“They are influencers.”
Asked if he would do the likewise, Tedros said: “I would be happy to do the same thing. I would be happy to do it.”
He stressed though that he would not want to jump the line and receive a jab needed by someone else, underlining the WHO’s call for vaccines to be distributed equitably.
“I need to make sure it’s my turn. I don’t want to take anybody’s vaccine,” he said.
Britain on Wednesday became the first Western country to approve a vaccine, from Pfizer-BioNTech, for general use, piling pressure on other countries to follow suit swiftly.
But experts have voiced concern over growing signs of vaccine hesitancy, with misinformation and mistrust colouring people’s acceptance of scientific advances on the vaccines.
A WHO report published Friday highlighted that “harnessing social influences”, by profiling people who are “particularly trusted” and willing to take a jab could help promote acceptance and uptake of Covid-19 vaccines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“So we hope that by December meron na pasimula (We hope by December there will be clinical trials),” said De la Pena during an interview over CNN Philippines.
The DoST Secretary cited that the pharmaceutical companies which have applied to conduct clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines include Sinovac of China, Gamaleya of Russia, AstraZeneca of Britain, and Janssen of the United States.“We are not spending for that,” De la Pena assured.
“But they are the ones who hire the contracted research organization who will implement the clinical trial,” he added.
The Science and Technology Secretary pointed out this is different from the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Solidarity Trials in which the government prepared funds and picked those who will implement the clinical trials.
De la Pena backed the declaration of Food and Drug Authority (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo that vaccines could be available in the Philippines by March once the government grants emergency use authorization (EUA) to pharmaceutical companies.“There are vaccines actually that may not have to go through clinical trials,” De la Pena said.“If the FDA in the country involved and the FDA in the Philippines will agree then they can be introduced even without doing the clinical trials here for as long as the data in the clinical trials abroad will be evaluated and found to be acceptable here in the Philippines.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Marcos pointed out that the government, local corporate donors, and AstraZeneca signed a purchase agreement to acquire 2.6 million doses of the vaccine for about P600 million, or about $5 per dose.Marcos added that subsequent purchases of the same vaccine should cost less because the Philippines is also among the 92 low and lower-middle income countries that will benefit from international donor-funded vaccines under the global initiative known as the COVAX Advance Market Commitment facility.
The COVAX AMC aims to keep vaccine prices at not more than $3 per dose, through the efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi Vaccine Alliance, and vaccine-manufacturing countries, so that poorer nations can gain affordable and fair access to Covid-19 vaccines.
“With a budget of P600 million, the government should be able to buy not just 2.6 million doses but at least five million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. At $5, every Filipino vaccinated should be able to complete the two prescribed doses, not just half,” Marcos said.
Marcos cited Oxford’s statement issued last week, which partly reads: “A key element of Oxford’s partnership with AstraZeneca is the joint commitment to provide the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic across the world, and in perpetuity to low- and middle-income countries.”Marcos added that AstraZeneca has a local presence and has several manufacturing sites in China which would lower the cost of shipping the firm’s vaccines to the Philippines.
The cold chain storage cost of the vaccine would also be minimal since refrigeration at only two to eight degrees centigrade is needed, Marcos also said SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

This after President Duterte signed yesterday Executive Order 121 which allows the Director-General of the Food and Drug Administration to issue Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the COVID-19 drugs and vaccines,
With the EUA, the process of approving the use of COVID-19 vaccines from abroad would be expedited, Go explained.“Napirmahan na po ni Pangulong Duterte ‘yung (EO allowing the issue of) Emergency Use Authorization, so ngayon, mas mabilis na ang proseso. Mas mabilis makakagalaw ang FDA. Ito ang inaantay ng FDA kasi merong vaccine na dumaan na sa clinical trial sa ibang bansa at gusto nila magbenta dito sa atin. Ito ay papayagan thru EUA,’’ he said. (President Duterte has already signed the (EO allowing the issue of) Emergency Use Authorization, the process is now faster. The FDA could move faster. The FDA has been waiting for this after a vaccine underwent clinical trial in other countries and they want to sale it to us here. This would be allowed thru EUA.)
“Sisiguraduhin po ng FDA na safe po ang vaccine at ‘yung efficacy ng vaccine na ito dahil hindi po basta basta papayag ang taumbayan na turukan ng vaccine kung di sila sigurado na safe sila,’’ he added. (The FDA would ensure that the vaccine is safe and effective because the people would not easily want to be inoculated unless they are sure that they are safe.)
Go said that it does not matter where the vaccine would come from as long as it is safe and effective.
In addition, Go had discussed with Carlito G. Galvez Jr., the chief implementer of the National Action Plan Against COVID-19 (NAP), that the acquisition of the vaccines from international companies, such as Gamaleya, Moderna and Pfizer, would be done by phases.
“So ang tanging isyu dito ay dapat maging safe muna bago nila ibigay, walang papayag na magpa-inject kung di sigurado na safe. Buhay ng bawat Pilipino ang nakataya dito, di natin makukumbinsi ang mga Pilipino kung di tayo siguradong safe ang vaccine na ituturok sa kanila,’’ he said. (So, the only issue here is the safety of the vaccine before using it, nobody wants to be injected with it if there is no assurance that it is safe. The lives of the Filipinos are at stake here, we cannot convince the Filipinos to have it if we are not sure that the vaccine to be injected to them is safe.)
“Ito ang napag-usapan namin ni DOH Secretary (Francisco) Duque (III) and Secretary Galvez na kapag nadeklara na itong safe ng FDA, uunahin natin ang mahihirap, uunahin natin ang mga vulnerable,’’ he stressed. (This is what I have discussed with DOH Secretary Duque and Sec. Galvez that once this is declared as safe by the FDA, we will prioritize the poor and the vulnerable sectors.)
“Uunahin rin natin ang mga frontliners, mga nagtatrabaho sa panahong ito tulad ng mga medical workers, militar at PNP. And, of course mga guro, kasi kung magbubukas na tayo ng klase sa susunod na taon, sila ang kailangan na safe po dahil haharap sila sa mga estudyante,’’ he added. (We would also prioritize the frontliners, the medical workers, military and PNP. And of course the teachers, because if we would open the classes next year, they have to be safe because they would face the students.)
As for the budget, Go said that sufficient funds should be allocated for the procurement, storage and distribution of the vaccines.
He reminded concerned officials to ensure that public funds are used properly and the right processes are followed.
“Kailangan natin meron tayong pondo dahil magrereserba po tayo nito. At ipinaalala po ni Pangulong Duterte sa finance managers natin na siguraduhing magkaroon ng due diligence. Bago bayaran, siguraduhing makakadeliver sila. Bago bigyan ng downpayment, siguraduhing ito po ang timetable at makakarating at mauuna sa mahihirap nating kababayan,’’ he added. (We need to have funds because we would be making reservations. President Duterte has reminded our finance managers to ensure that there would be due diligence. Before paying, there should be an assurancethat they could deliver. Before giving the downpayment, be sure that it would be delivered on or before the agreed timetable.) SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Obama, in an interview with SiriusXM radio, said he would be inoculated if top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci signs off on a Covid-19 vaccine.
“If Anthony Fauci tells me this vaccine is safe, and can vaccinate, you know, immunize you from getting Covid, absolutely, I’m going to take it,” Obama said.“I promise you that when it’s been made for people who are less at risk, I will be taking it,” he said.
“I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science, and what I don’t trust is getting Covid,” Obama said.
Freddy Ford, Bush’s chief of staff, told CNN the former president also wanted to help promote vaccination.
“First, the vaccines need to be deemed safe and administered to the priority populations,” Ford told CNN.“Then, president Bush will get in line for his, and will gladly do so on camera.”
Angel Urena, Clinton’s press secretary, told CNN the former president would also be up for getting a vaccine in public on television.
Later in the day, Biden told CNN in an interview that he, too, would be willing to be vaccinated in public after government approval of vaccines, specifically saying he would rely on Fauci to say it was safe.“It’s important to communicate to the American people it’s safe,” the 78-year-old said. “It’s safe to do this.”
He also lauded the three former presidents for their commitment, saying they had “set the model as to what should be done.”
Vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna-NIH are expected to be approved by US authorities shortly.
A top science official said Wednesday the United States hopes to have immunized 100 million people by the end of February. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Duterte stated this when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) for the second time this year at its 31st Special Session in Response to the COVID-19.
In his pre-recorded message aired past midnight Friday (Manila time), President Duterte amplified the Philippines’ call for greater solidarity and enhanced cooperation to address the challenges brought about by the pandemic.He reiterated his push for universal access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and technologies.
“Life-saving services and products must be made accessible to the most vulnerable. The most to the least,” he said.
According to the President, leaving a nation behind in the road to postpandemic recovery will discredit the values of the UN.
“If any country is excluded by reason of poverty or strategic unimportance, this gross injustice will haunt the world for a long time,” Duterte said.“It will completely discredit the values upon which the United Nations was founded,” he added.
“We cannot let this happen. No one is safe unless everyone is safe,” he continued. In his speech, President Duterte likewise expressed strong support for the global medical and scientific initiatives forged at the World Health Organization (WHO) like the COVID19 Vaccines Global Access or COVAX Facility.
The COVAX Facility, which the Philippines joined, is a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.Duterte reaffirmed the Philippines’ commitment to contributing to the pooling of global resources and helping other countries without preconditions.
“Our collective initiatives in the UN and other multilateral frameworks are our best chance to defeat COVID-19,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that a vaccine for COVID-19 may become available in the Philippines by March 2021.
(Daniel Schludi / UNSPLASH / MANILA BULLETIN)
FDA Director-General Rolando Enrique Domingo said that this is a possibility amid the recent developments in the United Kingdom, United States of America, and other countries. Previously, the government said that COVID-19 vaccines may reach the Philippines by the second quarter of next year.
He also added that the process of approving a vaccine will be shortened—from six months to 21-28 days—after President Duterte issued an executive order allowing the FDA to grant an emergency use authorization (EUA) to possible COVID-19 vaccines that will enter the country.The United Kingdom has approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 candidate vaccine for emergency use. Meanwhile, Pfizer and Moderna are now also in the process of securing an EUA from US health regulators, said Domingo.
Domingo said that pharmaceutical companies may apply for an EUA in the Philippines after they secure an EUA from their respective governments.
“Kapag nag-apply po sila dito sa atin, then maaring by first few weeks of January ay meron na rin po tayong maibigay na emergency use authorization at baka mapaaga ng kaunti or baka magkaroon ng chance na baka mga March ay magkaroon na ng bakuna dito sa Pilipinas [If they apply to us, then maybe by the first few weeks of January we will also be able to provide them an emergency use authorization. Also, there may be a chance that by March we will have a vaccine here in the Philippines],” said Domingo during the Malacanang press briefing.
The FDA chief said that those who already secured an EUA from the other countries would likely apply in the Philippines.“Ang mauuna siguro yung mga mayroon nang EUA [from other countries] katulad ng Pfizer, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Moderna, AstraZeneca. Ito po ay mga nag-apply na. Kapag nag-apply na po sila sa atin, within 21 to 28 days ay mabibigyan po natin ng desisyon kung approved or disapproved ang kanilang application [Those who already have EUA [from other countries] like Pfizer, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Moderna, AstraZeneca will probably come first. These are the ones who have already applied. When they apply to us, within 21 to 28 days we can give a decision if their application is approved or disapproved],” said Domingo.
Domingo said it “will be up to the decision of the program implementers” on who should be prioritized to receive the vaccines once already available.
He also added that the Department of Health (DOH) is now gearing to come up with an educational campaign about the potential risk and benefits of vaccines, noting that vaccination is not mandatory.“Hindi po kayo pwedeng pilitin, hindi pwedeng sapilitan. Kapag tayo ay nagpabakuna kailangan naiintidihan natin kumpleto kung ano ang benepsiyo nito at kung ano ang posibleng adverse events or side effects [You cannot force a person to be vaccinated. Before vaccination, we need to fully understand the benefits as well as the possible adverse events or side effects],” Domingo in a separate press briefing.
“Ang gagawin po talaga ng DOH at pinaplano na nila, ay talagang education campaign for people to be able to understand what vaccination is, what it is for, what are the risks and benefits, so that people can make an informed decision. Wala pong pwedeng pilitin na magpabakuna [What the DOH is really going to do and they are already planning, is really an education campaign for people to be able to understand what vaccination is, what it is for, what are the risks and benefits, so that people can make an informed decision.

The country could secure coronavirus vaccines by March 2021 once the government grants approval of such life-saving drugs for emergency use, Food and Drug Authority (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo said Thursday.
(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
According to Domingo, the coronavirus vaccines like those developed by Pfizer, Moderna, Sinovac, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca could apply for emergency use authorization (EUA) in the Philippines after they secure an equivalent EUA from concerned government and health authorities abroad.
The issuance of EUA will hasten the processing period for approving the coronavirus vaccine to 21 to 28 days from six months, according to Domingo.The health official made the remarks after citing that the United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) may authorize the emergency use of coronavirus vaccines developed Pfizer and Moderna within one to two weeks. The United Kingdom became the first Western nation to grant emergency approval to the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech and will reportedly roll out the first batch of doses next week.
“Ang ibig sabihin nito, itong mga kompanyang ito kapag sila na-approve nasa America or sa UK, maaaring naghahanda na sila sa pag-aapply sa iba’t-ibang bansa tulad ng Pilipinas. kapag nag-apply sila dito sa atin, then maaring by first few weeks of January mayroon na tayong maibgay na EUA (This means that once these companies secure an approval in the United States or United Kingdom, they are likely preparing to apply in other countries like the Philippines. If they apply in the country, then we can give EUA in the first few weeks of January),” Domingo said during a virtual Palace press briefing.
“At baka mapaaga na kaunti, baka magkaroon ng chance ng mga March ay magkaroon ng bauna dito sa Pilipinas (It may arrive earlier, there might be a chance the Philippines can have the vaccines by March),” he said.
Prior to Domingo’s remarks, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said President Duterte wanted the government’s COVID immunization program to begin earlier than the projected second quarter of 2021. Roque asked Domingo if the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine would be possible in the first quarter of 2021.Asked by Roque if the vaccines can be made available as early as January, Domingo agreed that this was possible. The FDA official however made clear that the country’s vaccine supply will depend on the amount of drug production by the foreign pharmaceutical firms.
“Magiging depende na lang ito sa production, kung mayroon mailalalaan na supply para sa Pilipinas atmaide-deliver agad sa atin para ma-distribute natin (It will now depend on the production, if they can set aside a supply for the Philippines, deliver them to us so we can distribute them),” Domingo said.Asked about the possible vaccines that may be given EUA in the country, Domingo said these drugs must already have an equivalent emergency use authority from its origin country, a stringent regulatory authority or the World Health Organization. He said this will be the government’s primary requirement for vaccines applying for EUA in the country.President Duterte earlier granted authority to the FDA director general to issue EUA for coronavirus vaccines and treatments. The latest move aims to accelerate the the availability and use of such vaccines in the absence of available alternatives.
In evaluating EUA applications, the FDA director general is authorized to implement reliance and recognition process for the emergency use of drugs and vaccines.The FDA can also convene a panel of experts to conduct a review of data on the safety and efficacy of a COVID-19 drug or vaccine applying for an EUA.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered “large-scale” vaccinations to start next week with the country’s Sputnik V vaccine (AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN)
The news came as the UN convenes a special two-day summit on the pandemic Thursday, with European leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to speak virtually on their countries’ response to the global health crisis.
Notably absent will be populist heads of state like US President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, as well as Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country was ground zero as the virus began its deadly crawl across the globe late last year.Meanwhile US hospitalizations of COVID patients topped 100,000 for the first time Wednesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project, while daily deaths topped 2,700, the highest fatality rate since April.
The United States, which has suffered the highest virus toll with more than 270,000 deaths, reported that it hopes to have immunized 100 million people against COVID-19 by the end of February.
The UK’s independent medicines regulator gave a green light to the BioNTech-Pfizer drug in doublequick time but insisted safety had come first.
“Everybody can be confident that no corners whatsoever have been cut,” said Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) chief executive June Raine.“The public deserve nothing less.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the move heralded a vaccination program “that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.”
His government said some 800,000 doses would be administered starting as soon as next week.
With over 59,000 deaths from 1.6 million cases, Britain’s outbreak remains the deadliest in Europe.The EU’s medicines regulator insisted Wednesday it has the ”most appropriate” method to approve a coronavirus vaccine, after British ministers claimed that leaving the bloc, and its rules, had allowed them to adopt the jab ahead of their European neighbors.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it will hold a special meeting by December 29 at the latest to decide on whether to grant conditional approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
Global tolls climb
Meanwhile Mexico said it signed an agreement Wednesday with Pfizer to buy 34.4 million doses of vaccine, with a first batch due to arrive this month.
The cumulative total of COVID19 cases surged by nearly 30 percent across the Americas in just one month, the Pan American Health Organization warned, releasing figures for November.
Canada is seeing worrying surges along with Brazil and Cuba. Japan and Italy decided that vaccines, when approved, will be provided free to all residents.As in Britain, Italy plans for medical staff and people in elderly care homes to be among the first vaccinated.
Merkel announced that cultural and sporting facilities in Germany as well as restaurants and bars will remain shut until January 10, extending shutdown measures to curb transmission of the coronavirus.
In Spain, Health Minister Salvador Illa announced that people will exceptionally be able to travel to visit family over Christmas but that such get-togethers must be restricted to 10 people at the most.
Close to 1.5 million people globally had died from the coronavirus as of 0200 GMT Thursday, according to an AFP count based on official sources, while more than 64 million have been infected.
‘Science will win’
Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla declared the UK certification a “historic moment in the fight against COVID-19.”
“This authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win,” he said.
US giant Pfizer and German newcomer BioNTech added that they expected further regulatory decisions from other countries in the coming days and weeks.
Other vaccines expected to come on stream soon include ones from Moderna and AstraZeneca/Oxford University, which has strong backing from the UK government.
Many poorer countries are pinning their hopes on the AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate, which can be kept in regular refrigerators and is being offered at cost price.
But it is undergoing further data analysis after questions were raised over the effectiveness of its dosage regime.
With effectiveness around 95 percent, both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are based on new mRNA technology, which hacks into human cells to effectively turn them into vaccinemaking factories.
Large-scale Russia vaccinations On Wednesday Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will not attend the UN summit either, ordered ”large-scale” vaccinations to start next week with the country’s Sputnik V vaccine.
Over 100,000 people have already been vaccinated with Sputnik V, currently in the final stage of clinical trials involving some 40,000 volunteers.
Beyond the hoped-for jabs, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and biotech firm Regeneron are working on a nasal spray that is designed to stop infection from the virus, initially testing the gene therapy on animals. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

He has issued Executive Order No. 121 granting authority to the FDA director general to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for drugs and vaccines that may prevent, diagnose, or treat coronavirus but with certain conditions.
The regulatory practice of EUA issuance aims to hasten the availability and use of coronavirus drugs and vaccines in the absence of available approved and adequate alternatives.“It is a priority of the State to ensure that the lives of the Filipino people, especially the underprivileged, poor, and marginalized, our frontliners, healthcare providers, police officers and soldiers, and those in the essential services shall be protected from COVID-19 by ensuing accessibility and adequacy of supply of related drugs and vaccines,” Duterte said in the order.
The Health department had earlier asked the President to allow the FDA to grant EUA for coronavirus vaccines and drugs that will shorten the approval process to 21 days from usual six months. The emergency use authorization was sought following the recent breakthroughs in the vaccine development by foreign drug manufacturers.
Under the EO, the President set the following conditions for the issuance of EUA:
1. Based on the totality of evidence available, including data from adequate and well-known controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the drug or vaccine may be effective to prevent, diagnose, or treat COVID-19;2. The known and potential benefits of the drug or vaccine when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat COVID-19 outweighs the known and potential risks of the drug or vaccine, if any; and;
3. There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the drug or vaccine for COVID-19.
“Outside clinical trials and except in cases where a Compassionate Special Permit is issued, no unregistered COVID-19 drug and vaccine may be manufactured, sold, imported, exported, distributed, or transferred without an EUA,” Duterte said.EO 121 also stated any application for EU must comply with “good manufacturing practices” and accompanied by an underlying by the manufacturer to complete the development of the drug and vaccine.
In evaluating EUA applications, the FDA director general will have the power to implement reliance and recognition process for the emergency use of drugs and vaccines.
“For this purpose, the FDA director general may accept the regulatory decision of the WHO (World Health Organization), US-CDC (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), or other internationally recognized and established regulatory authorities,” Duterte said.
The President also allowed the FDA to convene a panel to conduct a review of data on the safety and efficacy of a COVID-19 drug or vaccine applied for an EUA. The panel will be composed of excerpts on drug and vaccine development.
“After the review, the panel shall submit to the FDA Director General its report and recommendations on the application for EUA.”
Any issuance of EUA will be valid only within the duration of the declared public health emergency due to the coronavirus. The FDA director general may revisit or revoke the EUA as appropriate to protect public health and safety.
The order also allowed the FDA to conduct “post-authorization monitoring” to track product deployment, additional relevant information, and the status from the manufacturer on the product’s life cycle.
“The holder of an EUA shall be required to complete specific pharmacovigilance obligations, with a view to providing comprehensive data confirming a positive benefit-risk balance.”
The FDA is also directed to submit to the President a monthly report on the implementation of the latest EO.
The order, signed by the President on Dec.1, takes effect upon publication in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The bill, which says the government will cover all vaccine costs for Japan’s 126 million residents, was approved by the upper house of parliament, having cleared the powerful lower house.
The country has secured Covid-19 vaccines for 60 million people from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and for a further 25 million people from biotech firm Moderna.It has also confirmed it will receive 120 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine.
Pfizer and Moderna are already seeking emergency-use approval in the United States and Europe, after clinical tests showed their jabs were effective.
The bill’s passage comes two weeks after Japan’s prime minister said the country was on “maximum alert” over the virus, and as medics warn hospitals are on the brink of collapse.
Japan has seen a comparatively small Covid-19 outbreak overall, with around 2,100 deaths and 150,000 cases, and has not imposed the strict lockdowns seen elsewhere.But it is now facing a third wave of the disease, reporting record numbers of daily infections nationwide in recent weeks.
Tokyo’s governor has urged residents to avoid non-essential outings and asked businesses serving alcohol to shut early, although there is no enforcement mechanism for these recommendations.

The President said he trusted a group of honest officials on the government’s pandemic response, particularly in the acquisition of the vaccines.
“Medisina well ito, malaki ‘to (On the medicine, it will be huge) but it’s being handled by a competent group of men whose integrity,” Duterte said during a televised address Monday night. “So your money is in safe hands,” he added.The government earlier identified P73.2 billion in funds to acquire potential vaccines to protect Filipinos from the new coronavirus disease. The funds for the vaccine purchase will come from multilateral agencies, domestic and bilateral sources.
The country’s vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government plans to buy vaccine supply for 60 to 70 million Filipinos in the next three to five years. Inoculating such population number would be enough to attain herd immunity and curb the spread of the coronavirus, according to health authorities. The government is already in talks with some foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers to secure the country’s supply of the life-saving drugs.
As the world awaits for the vaccine production, the President has urged anew the public to continue to observe health measures to avoid getting infected. He said people should stay at home if they have nothing essential to do outside.
Duterte also rejected allegations of critics that the government was mishandling the pandemic response. He explained that the government has relaxed the movement restrictions so people can go back to work so they can take care of their families.
“Stay safe,” Duterte reminded the public.“Halos kinukulong mo na ang lahat nagugutom naman. So luwagan mo (If you keep them at home, they might go hungry so better relax the restrictions) because they have to eat, they have to survive,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

https://mb.com.ph/2020/12/02/which-americans-will-get-the-covid-vaccine-first/,Which Americans will get the Covid vaccine first?,by Agence France-Presse,"Published December 2, 2020, 6:31 AM","
The Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines could be approved in a matter of weeks, but who in the United States will get them first?The Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine could be available to millions of Americans within weeks
Though nothing has yet been decided, US experts may differ from other countries in prioritizing “critical workers” who keep society running — potentially even before people at highest risk.
To be clear, there won’t be one single set of rules for the whole nation.
At the risk of creating confusion, which was the case during the vaccine campaign against the H1N1 flu in 2009, the federal government only makes recommendations to states, who decide for themselves how to distribute the doses and who gets priority.Panels of top experts have already delivered their opinions, which diverge in certain key respects and reveal the tension at the center of the debate: vaccines should both protect the most vulnerable and help facilitate a return to normal.It’s on the question of jumpstarting the economy as quickly as possible that the US may set itself apart.
France’s top health authority recommended starting with retirement home residents and employees who work there, followed by the elderly and health care workers, then the over-50s, people whose jobs put them at risk, medically high-risk people, the poor, and finally the rest of the population.That’s the approach recommended by the World Health Organization and adopted by a number of rich countries, Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told AFP.
In the US, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) compiled a more than 200-page report suggesting frontline health care workers are given the vaccine first, then first responders such as paramedics, police and firefighters.
Next would come people with two or more underlying conditions (including the likes of cancer, obesity and diabetes), whatever their age, then the two million people in nursing homes.
– Keeping the country running –
For the next phase, NASEM emphasizes less age and more profession, prioritizing “critical” workers who keep the country running.
These include teachers, workers from slaughterhouses to the supermarkets who keep Americans fed, and those who drive buses and trains, sell them their medicine, maintain order, or deliver mail and parcels.
People in these jobs are often minority Hispanics or Black, and have been hit disproportionately by the pandemic.
After these tens of millions of workers, the next on the list could be people who have one underlying condition, the homeless, prisoners, and people over 65 without comorbidities.
Younger adults and students, who are at lower risk of severe disease but have been major spreaders of the virus, would come next, ahead of the rest of the population.
This is only a proposal. The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) are awaiting the opinion of their own expert committee, which will vote on Tuesday.This committee has previously suggested that it could prioritize health care personnel and critical workers, because immunizing them will provide a “multiplier effect”: not only are they essential cogs in the health response and the economy, but they are in contact with a lot of people. In practice, these ethical, epidemiological and economic considerations may be ignored in the initial rush on doses.Problems remain to be solved: though it may be easy to target retirement homes and hospitals, how are pharmacists and doctors supposed to confirm that a person is indeed an essential worker, or that they have two underlying conditions? In addition, the Trump administration has said it will not be bound by the advice of its scientists and that retirement homes will receive Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines as early as mid-December in the event of a regulatory green light.

The country’s vaccine czar said “equitable access” to the COVID-19 vaccine might only be achieved in the Philippines by 2022.
(Daniel Schludi / UNSPLASH / MANILA BULLETIN)
“Only maybe in 2022 that we will have equitable access to the [vaccine],” National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. told ANC in an interview Monday.
Galvez said the government might allow the commercialization of COVID-19 vaccines by 2022 if the country has enough supply by then.According to Galvez, even the World Health Organization (WHO) and the vaccine makers will not indulge in vaccine commercialization by next year.
‘Vaccination rollout’
Galvez said the government will be implementing a science-based, geographical, and sectoral approach to its COVID-19 vaccination program.
“By geographical, we have to vaccinate people in those areas who are affected by the virus, particularly in the National Capital Region, Davao, Cagayan de Oro, and in Cebu,” Galvez said.
Galvez said the priority for the vaccination program will be the health workers, followed by the poor and vulnerable societies.“Really, the priority is the poor people. The President has spoken that the access should be equitable to the poor initially, and then after, for the upper bracket,” he added.
“Our stand is really to impose that regimen, that we will impose our priority based on the DOH guidelines,” he said.
Essential workers, including members of the Departments of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and Education (DepEd) and other agencies will also be prioritized, according to Galvez.Policemen, servicemen, and soldiers serving in the frontlines are likewise included in the priority list.
After vaccinating those on the priority list, Galvez said next in line will be essential workers from businesses.
‘Continuous talks’
Galvez said the government has been continuously negotiating with different vaccine manufacturers and developers to procure enough vaccines needed to achieve its target of vaccinating at least 75 to 80 percent of the population.
“We have very encouraging results of negation right now. This week we will be negotiating with Serum Institute of India (SII). We are trying to meet also with Pfizer, Sinovac, and also Johnson & Johnson and maybe Moderna…and Novavax,” he said.
Galvez said based on the estimates, the Philippines can get around 10 to 15 million, even 20 million vaccines from each of the vaccine makers the government is planning to have talks with. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

https://mb.com.ph/2020/12/01/welcome-covid-vaccine-developments-around-the-world/,Welcome COVID vaccine developments around the world,by Manila Bulletin,"Published December 1, 2020, 5:51 AM","In the face of the bad news from Europe and the United States (US), where a second wave of COVID-19 infections is sweeping many communities, it is reassuring to know that vaccines are now being mass-produced and many countries are drawing up agreements with the vaccine producers.
Two US vaccines have reported 95 percent efficacy in their final trials and should get the approval of the US Federal Drug Administration any time soon. The first to announce the success of its final mass testing was US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer with its partner BioNTech, followed a few days later by Moderna.
AstraZeneca of the United Kingdom (UK) and its partner Oxford University then announced they would soon seek regulatory approval in Europe, after its vaccine recorded 90 percent effectiveness. Tests are continuing and will be known next month, said the Oxford Vaccine Group.
Russia had earlier announced interim results of its Sputnik V vaccine tests. It also reported a 95 percent effectivity, but has yet to complete its final Phase 3 tests as required by the World Health Organization. Russia announced that Indian drug make Hetero will produce over 100 million doses a year.
But the earliest vaccine program is that of China where COVID-19 first emerged in December, 2019. As early as February, 2020, China was testing a vaccine developed by Chinese military scientists and has since conducted efficacy trials in Brazil, Turkey, and Indonesia.
Last Friday, the Philippine government signed a tripartite agreement with the UK’s AstraZeneca and a Philippine group of 0 private sector representatives. The agreement is for 2.6 million doses of the UK vaccine. Half will be set aside for government frontliners in the anti-COVID effort and half for private sector employees. The vaccines are expected to arrive by May or June, 2021.
These are the latest developments on the vaccine front. We are fortunate COVID-19 cases appear to be under control in the Philippines, although cases are under close watch in three regions of the country – Metro Manila, Central Luzon, and Calabarzon.
In contrast, cases are rising in the US, Germany and other European countries, as well as in India, Brazil, and Russia.
The world is now pinning its best hopes on the vaccines that are now in their final stages of testing and approval. As vaccinations start around the world, developing “herd immunity” will deprive the virus of new victims and it should slowly die down.
We will have our initial share of these vaccines around May. But that is still months away, so each one of us must continue to maintain our personal precautions against COVID-19 infection. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Duterte administration is hard put at choosing which agency or office would handle the vaccine procurement from foreign sources, Senator Imee R. Marcos said today.

‘’The Department of Health (DOH) and PhilHealth (Philippine Health Insurance Corporation) are surrounded by corruption scandals,’’ she pointed out.
“The performance in previous procurements by the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC), which is the government’s trading arm, has been short of stellar,’’ she added.The PITC is being asked to transfer to the Bureau of Treasury about P33 billion of funds from government agencies, including the Philippine Army, entrusted to it for years for the purchase of equipment and supplies from abroad.
“Once the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the vaccine, government protocols on procurement should already be in place,’’ Marcos said.
Marcos emphasized that mass distribution of vaccines is just as important a concern as their procurement.
‘’We have to make certain that the DoH and local government units (LGUs) distribute the procured vaccines to our highly vulnerable, high-risk groups,’’ she said.“The first order of business of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement signed this month should be the universal and equitable provision of the vaccine, prioritizing the most vulnerable and high-risk nations and sectors.

The COVID-19 candidate vaccine of British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca would still undergo the country’s regulatory process before it can be used in the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) said.
Department of Health (DOH) (MANILA BULLETIN)
On Nov. 27, the government and private companies signed a supply agreement with AstraZeneca involving at least three million doses of its vaccine.
DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the deal with the British firm is an “advance commitment.”“It’s just like they are having this advance commitment para makasigurado na merong allocation na ganito kadami (to make sure there is an allocation of this quantity),” she said.
“Ito ay mga negosasyon palang na ginagawa sa ngayon. If the private sector…. para bang nagkaroon na sila ng paunang mga agreements with these companies, hindi naman po iyan mangyayari hanggang hindi nakakapasa po ang mga bakunang iyan dito sa regulatory process natin,” she said.
(These are just negotiations that are being done right now. If the
private sector had initial agreements with these companies, it would not push through if these vaccines will not pass our regulatory process.)
Vergeire said that any candidate vaccine that will enter the Philippines should undergo the evaluation of health authorities such as the country’s vaccine experts panel and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).“There is regulatory oversight. Ang gobyerno natin hindi papayagan na makapasok sa ating merkado kung wala pang rehistro o authority from FDA kasi hindi natin masisiguro kung ito ay ligtas o epektibo [Our government has a regulatory oversight [panel],” she said.

A Mindanao lawmaker stressed Friday the importance of being able to produce and store vaccines for COVID-19 within the Philippines.
“Vaccines need specialized, temperature-controlled containers for proper transport. Our country must have enough of these cold storage containers and facilities so that the COVID-19 vaccines can be properly and safely shipped,” Misamis Oriental Rep. Juliette Uy said in a statement.
The Department of Health (DoH) bared a few weeks ago that clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines would start as early as this December.“If we do not yet have these vaccines and means of cold storage, the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) should find ways to manufacture the vaccines and cold containers on a massive scale, along with the production of tens of millions of syringes and other supplies needed,” said Uy, a vice chairperson of the Committee on Appropriations.
“Some of the COVID-19 vaccines could be produced in the industrial estates like PHIVIDEC under license from the original manufacturers,” she noted. PHIVIDEC is located in Misamis Oriental.
Uy said the country would also need areas where enough vaccines and supplies can be stored on standby for future needs.
“We must anticipate vaccination of migrant balikbayans; returning OFWs (overseas Filipino workers); foreign tourists; crews of international airlines, passenger ships, and cargo ships; personnel of foreign embassies, international regional headquarters; and visiting foreign troops,” she said.

Carlito Galvez, chief implementer of the Philippines’s Declared National Policy Against COVID-19, and Lotis Ramin, president of AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines Inc. in a virtual ceremony at JoeCon Hall in RFM Corporate Center.
Concepcion explained that the vaccines will be donated to the Department of Health, who will handle the deployment. Half of the donations will be set aside for government frontliners, while the other 50% will cover employees in the private sector – both regular and contractual.Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion is leading private
sector efforts to procure 2.5 million to 3 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine from British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca in an effort to augment the national government’s separate procurement initiatives.“We’re targeting 2.5 million to 3 million doses which will help 1.5 million people in the upper end of the range since the vaccine requires two doses. We want to ensure that the Philippines will not be left behind when the vaccines come out in 2021,” Concepcion said, adding that the deal has an estimated value of P600 million-P700 million.
Go Negosyo will purchase 70,000 doses of the vaccine for MSMEs which will cover 35,000 people when the vaccines are made available by next year.The vaccine from AstraZeneca is expected to cost around P500 ($10) for two doses, which is cheaper than regular testing methods.
The private sector is working closely with vaccine czar Galvez who is leading separate government-led discussions with pharma companies, including AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca has a zero-profit program for 2021, which means the vaccines are priced as low as possible.

The vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University in the UK can reportedly protect up to 90 percent of people from getting the coronavirus based on recent clinical trials. The AstraZeneca vaccine is reportedly substantially cheaper compared to its rivals.
The latest vaccine is the third to produce efficacy results, following the experimental drugs made by US-based Pfizer and Moderna. Both Western-developed vaccines reportedly showed more than 90 percent efficiency.
The Philippine government recently identified P73.2 billion in funds to secure coronavirus vaccines for 60 million Filipinos. Talks with Pfizer and China’s Sinovac have been initiated for possible supply arrangements.Once the vaccines arrive in the country, the priority beneficiaries of the government’s free vaccines are the country’s health workers, soldiers, cops, essential workers, and the country’s poor and vulnerable citizens.
According to Galvez, the government aims to attain “herd immunity” by vaccinating around 75 percent of the country’s population to effectively contain the outbreak. He noted that the government plans to acquire 25 million to 35 million vaccines every year until the herd immunity target is achieved.
Asked why the government’s vaccination program might take two to three years, Galvez explained that there are some challenges related to vaccine supply and demand. Under the “best case scenario,” Galvez said the coronavirus vaccines may be rolled out in the country by the second quarter of 2021.Also, Galvez admitted that the country has limited cold storage facilities needed for the shipment of coronavirus vaccines.

MOSCOW — Russia said Tuesday its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine is 95 percent effective and would be cheaper and easier to store than some alternatives, as the global race heats up to develop a jab.
The announcement was the latest in a flurry of breakthroughs as several vaccine makers worldwide published preliminary data showing efficacy rates of 90 percent and higher.
This handout picture taken on August 6, 2020 and provided by the Russian Direct Investment Fund shows the vaccine against the coronavirus disease, developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.

Countries are hoping to begin inoculating their populations by year’s end or in early 2021 to stop a pandemic that has claimed the lives of nearly 1.4 million people.Russia was one of the first to announce the development of a vaccine in August – dubbed Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite – but before the start of final clinical trials.
In statement on Tuesday, the vaccine’s developers said preliminary data after trials involving thousands of volunteers showed “an efficacy of the vaccine above 95 percent” after a second dose.
Russia’s health ministry, the state-run Gamaleya research centre and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said in the statement they expected the vaccine to record an even higher effectiveness after the next analysis.
“No unexpected adverse events were identified as part of the research,” it said, though some of those vaccinated suffered short term effects including fever, weakness, fatigue, and headache.Less than $10 per dose The two-dose vaccine will be available on international markets for less than $10 (8.40 euros) per dose, they said, and will be free for Russian citizens.
It can be stored at between two and eight degrees Celsius (between 35.6 and 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit), they said, instead of the temperatures far below freezing required for some other vaccines.
Pharma giants Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their virus vaccine is 95 percent effective, while US company Moderna said last week early results showed its candidate was 94.5 percent effective.Western experts have in the past expressed concern over Russia’s vaccine, fearing that its development could be rushed. Several welcomed Tuesday’s announcement though they said more data was needed.
“This is yet more good news demonstrating a high interim vaccine efficacy,” said Azra Ghani, an infectious diseases specialist at Imperial College London.
“The lack of any serious adverse events in approximately 20,000 trial participants is also very encouraging,” she said.
Russia has applied to the World Health Organization for accelerated registration and pre-qualification of the Sputnik V vaccine.
President Vladimir Putin last week said that Russia had manufacturing agreements in place with China and India and encouraged Brazil and South Africa to also mass produce Russian-developed vaccines.The head of the RDIF, Kirill Dmitriev, said Tuesday that European Union member Hungary would also manufacture the Sputnik V vaccine.
Russia in recent weeks has registered a steep increase in new coronavirus infections but has stopped short of introducing strict measures like some European countries.
‘Alarming’ rise in Russia cases
The country’s total infections on Tuesday stood at 2.14 million, the fifth-highest caseload in the world.
But at 37,031, virus deaths are significantly lower than other badly hit countries, raising concerns that the authorities are downplaying the pandemic’s severity.
Data published by Russia’s federal statistics service earlier this month indicated excess deaths of more than 117,000 year-on-year between March and September, suggesting that virus fatalities could be much higher.
While Moscow remains the epicentre of Russia’s outbreak, the country’s poorly funded regions are taking the brunt of the second wave.
Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova on Tuesday said that in six of Russia’s 85 regions, over 90 percent of hospital beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients were occupied.
Russia hopes to avoid a second nationwide lockdown by accelerating the production of vaccines. Putin has dismissed talk of another lockdown and emphasized last week that vaccines are on their way despite voicing concern over the country’s “alarming” case totals and fatality rate.
He last month announced that Russia had registered a second coronavirus vaccine, EpiVacCorona.

https://mb.com.ph/2020/11/26/covid-vaccines-why-the-safety-process-reassures-experts/,Covid vaccines: Why the safety process reassures experts,by Agence France-Presse,"Published November 26, 2020, 6:12 AM","
Covid-19 vaccine emergency approvals are around the corner, makers are preparing to ship millions of doses — and experts are trying to reassure the public that the record-breaking speed of development hasn’t compromised safety.
One statistic that is key to these persuasive efforts is that almost all side effects from vaccines occur in the six weeks following immunization.
Participants in the huge trials for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna-National Institutes for Health jabs, the two frontrunners expected to be greenlit in December, were monitored for two months after the second dose — a requirement of the US Food and Drug Administration.“There is a difference between fast and too fast,” Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health told AFP.
Two months in fact covers the “overwhelming majority” of what are referred to as “adverse events,” he said.
In ordinary times, the FDA requires six months of follow up.But if nothing is revealed in the first two months, it’s very rare to see anything in the next four — and the gravity of the public health crisis has altered the risk-benefit calculations.“At this point where we are in the pandemic, we have to think about not waiting for the perfect data, although I want the perfect data,” said Grace Lee, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford who is a member of an advisory committee on vaccines for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The most reassuring thing about the current trials is their size: 44,000 volunteers for Pfizer, while Moderna has 30,000.
Around half of the volunteers have so far been studied for at least two months.
The FDA will therefore have safety data on tens of thousands of people, which is far more than the average of 6,700 people for other vaccines authorized in the past decade.
– ‘Severe’ but not ‘serious’ –
Both makers said that after two months of receiving their second dose, there were no “serious” side effects — those which put a patient’s life in danger, require hospitalization, or cause permanent disability.
This category includes dangerous allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock), neurological problems, and of course death.
What they did observe was fatigue, headaches, body aches, joint pain, redness and pain site of the jab, especially after the second dose.
These “Level 3” or “severe” events, in medical jargon — resolved without hospitalization, occurred in only a few percent of people and are deemed acceptable.The FDA will nevertheless be studying much more detailed safety data than was communicated by the two makers in their press releases.
Experts have so far been reassured by the apparent absence of “vaccine enhanced disease,” that is to say signs that the medicine made things worse not better, as was observed with a vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus in the 1960s.
– Ongoing monitoring –
After the possible authorizations, monitoring or “pharmacovigilance” efforts will continue for years.Well-established systems exist in the United States and in Europe to statistically detect any increase in serious medical events in the vaccinated population, and to confirm cause and effect.For influenza vaccines, for example, the CDC has detected a possible tiny increase in the number of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (where the immune system attacks the nervous system).
And even among those rare cases, all happened within six weeks of inoculation, said Edward Belongia, a scientist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute who’s been researching flu vaccines for the CDC for 15 years.
Post-authorization surveillance led to the withdrawal in 1999 of the first rotavirus vaccine in the United States, nine months after its authorization.Rare cases of bowel obstruction had been observed in young children two weeks after vaccination.
In general, though monitoring leads to use restrictions on certain groups, rather than withdrawal, said Omer.
Skepticism varies by country. In China, 88 percent of people polled by the journal Nature in June were ready to be vaccinated, compared to 59 percent in France and 55 percent in Russia.This summer, as suspicions arose that President Donald Trump was pressuring the FDA to approve a vaccine faster, some Americans became more hesitant.The trend has passed since he lost the election, according to an Ipsos poll conducted this month.

The government may remove the 5,000 cap on the deployment of health workers abroad if the coronavirus vaccine is available in the market, a Palace official said Tuesday.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque explained that the government placed a limit on the number of health workers allowed to work overseas mainly due to the pandemic.
The government wanted to make sure the country will still have enough medical workers to attend to the needs of Filipinos, he added.“‘Yung 5,000, iyan po ay initial. Kung iyan po ay maubos in the second quarter at mayroon na namang bakuna, baka tanggalin na iyan altogether (The 5,000 (cap) is just initial. If it runs out in the second quarter and we already have a vaccine, it may be removed altogether),” he said during a Palace press briefing Tuesday.
“Sinisiguro lang natin na hindi naman tayo mauubusan ng mga nurses, nursing assistants, at nursing aides na mayroong clinical experience dahil kung mawala iyong may clinical experience, sinong mag-aalaga sa atin kung tayo ay magkakasakit? (We are trying to ensure that we won’t run out of nurses, nursing assistants, and nursing aides with clinical experience because if we run out of those with clinical experience, who would take care of us if we get sick?),” he said.
President Duterte recently allowed the overseas deployment of nurses and other health workers abroad starting January, 2021, but with a limit of 5,000 each year. The recommendation was made by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).
The Palace explained that the President agreed to lift the deployment ban of health workers due to the decreasing coronavirus cases and the prospect of a coronavirus vaccine, among others. The President also recognized it was time to let the health care workers pursue a job that will help improve their lives.The deployment ban was imposed back in April to ensure the protection of the health workers as well as augment the country’s frontliners in the battle against the pandemic. The government later relaxed the restrictions, allowing health workers with complete documents as of March 8, and then adjusted the date to August 28, to leave the country.

The US plans to distribute 6.4 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in the first week after it is cleared for emergency use, which is likely next month, officials said Tuesday.
A committee of the Food and Drug Administration meets on December 10 to decide on whether to green light the medicine.General Gustave Perna, chief operations officer for the government’s Operation Warp Speed, told reporters some 40 million doses of vaccine would be available by the end of December.That figure includes another vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institutes for Health, which announced some preliminary efficacy results last week and is also close to applying for emergency approval.
The Pfizer vaccine has ultra-cold long-term storage requirements of -70 degrees Celsius, and the company has developed special containers with dry ice to keep it cool for up to 15 days.
Perna said that 64 jurisdictions across the US — including the 50 states, territories like the capital Washington and Puerto Rico and Indian reservations — received their allocation numbers on Friday.
The amount they receive will be proportionate to their population size.The federal government will issue recommendations for who should be prioritized — likely the elderly, high-risk, and frontline workers — but local authorities will make the final decision for themselves.
Vaccinations will begin in retirement homes within 48 hours of the emergency approval, health secretary Alex Azar said. The government has partnered with CVS Health for the retirement home program. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto on Tuesday welcomed President Duterte’s decision for the government to pay in advance the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, but maintained that the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) should not be the one tasked for its procurement.
Senator Ralph Recto (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
In statement, Recto said Duterte was “correct” in approving the prepayment of the coronavirus vaccines as “vaccines are not COD (cash-on-delivery) goods you can order from Lazada.”
“They are not postpaid items, but prepaid. More so when there is a race among nations to acquire them, with the first batches already pledged to rich nations who have bankrolled their development,” he added.Recto said, however, that he hopes that the administration’s urgency to purchase the vaccines will be conveyed to the officials of the PITC “whose stint in office has so far been unblemished with success.”
“Kung nahihirapan ngang bumili ng suka, bakuna pa kaya (If they are having a hard time buying vinegar, what more if they are asked to purchase vaccines)?” he said.
Senators had said that the PITC should not be trusted for the purchase of the COVID-19 vaccines for the delays in its procurement, which make it appear that government agencies have been disbursing their allocations under the national budget.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said P33.4 billion in funds from various years have been “sleeping” in the Department of Trade and Industry-attached corporation.Meanwhile, Recto said he hopes that the government will also pursue its vaccine supply deal with AstraZeneca “as their vaccine matches our wallet, reportedly the cheapest at $10 per person, and our weather, can be stored at home refrigerators.”“That will cut huge expenses for a cold chain, which the Pfizer vaccine would need as they have to be stored at -80 degrees Celcius —the infrastructure for which this tropical archipelago does not have,” he said.
Recto earlier pushed for additional funding to cover the government’s expenses for storage, delivery and post-vaccination surveillance, as well as the increased coverage of the immunization.“Let us go for universal immunization. We cannot emerge out of this pandemic and recoup what we have lost if our society is divided between the Haves (may bakuna) and the Have Nots (at wala). ‘Sana all’ should be our fighting slogan,” he said.

France is expected to loosen its coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday as the boss of a major airline said proof of vaccination will likely become the only way people can fly in a post-pandemic world.

Hopes over Covid-19 vaccines have given a boost to virus-weary citizens across the globe, but the disease remains rampant and world leaders are urging people to be patient.French President Emmanuel Macron will address the country — currently under lockdown — to announce a reworking of the rules following a drop in nationwide infections.Macron’s televised speech comes a day after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said thanks to a major vaccine breakthrough, “the escape route is in sight” from the coronavirus crisis.
Johnson said that although the “scientific cavalry” was arriving, he warned “Christmas cannot be normal and there’s a long road to spring”.
The world is still engulfed in the unprecedented health crisis which has shattered economies, infected almost 58.9 million people and left nearly 1.4 million dead.
AstraZeneca and Oxford University on Monday said their drug had proved on average 70 percent effective at stopping the virus after trying it on 23,000 people, days after tests of two other drugs suggested they were more than 90 percent effective.While World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed the latest batch of results as light at the end of the “long dark tunnel”, he cautioned the world had to ensure drugs were distributed fairly.
“Every government rightly wants to do everything it can to protect its people,” Tedros said. “But there is now a real risk that the poorest and most vulnerable will be trampled in the stampede for vaccines.”
– Qantas vaccine rule –
Australia’s Qantas announced that international travellers will need to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to fly, becoming the first airline to suggest such rules could become common across the industry.CEO Alan Joyce said the Australian flag carrier would implement the measure once a vaccine was made available to the public.
“Whether you need that domestically, we will have to see what happens with Covid-19 in the market but certainly, for international visitors coming out (to Australia) and people leaving the country, we think that is a necessity.” he told Channel Nine.
Joyce predicted the rule would likely become standard practice around the world as governments and airlines consider the introduction of electronic vaccination passports.
Meanwhile, Australia’s Victoria state announced Tuesday its last coronavirus patient had been cleared of Covid-19 — a major milestone for what had been the epicentre of the country’s second wave.
An outbreak in Melbourne, Victoria’s capital, sent Australia’s second-biggest city into a strict months-long lockdown, with residents subject to a curfew and mandatory mask rules.Authorities have now reversed the toughest of the restrictions and other states have begun reopening their borders to Victoria, with New South Wales the first to do so Monday.
– ‘Selfish deaf ears’ –
The United States — by far the worst-hit nation — celebrates Thanksgiving on Thursday, and many Americans plan to spend the holiday with extended family despite authorities warning they risk exacerbating the disease raging across the country.
Nearly 258,000 people have died nationwide and the caseload is edging towards 12.4 million, according to Johns Hopkins University.Stopping short of issuing an outright ban, the US government’s health protection agency has for the first time called on Americans not to travel for the annual holiday, which sees families get together over turkey, yams and cranberry sauce.
Last weekend was the busiest since the start of the pandemic with more than three million people passing through US airports, according to the Transportation Security Administration, which is responsible for security checks.
“Our pleas for help have fallen on selfish deaf ears,” tweeted Cleavon Gilman, an emergency doctor in Arizona, where he said hospitals were “overwhelmed” with Covid patients.
– Sporting cheer –
Football fans in England can look forward to cheering on their Premier League teams from next month, but only a highly limited number of supporters will get through the turnstiles.A maximum of 4,000 people will be allowed to watch games in areas of the country under the least stringent rules.
“Clubs, leagues and the Sports Ground Safety Authority have worked hard to put in procedures to make stadiums safe places and we hope this is the first step on the road back to normality,” said the Football Supporters’ Association. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Secretary Carlito Galvez, chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 and the country’s vaccine czar, said the government is in talks with British vaccine-maker Astrazeneca, China’s Sinovac, and the tandem of US-based biotechnology companies Pfizer and Germany-based BioNTech.
“Nag-ne-negotiate na po tayo sa apat na malalaking kompanya kasama na po ang Sinovac from China, ‘yung AstraZeneca, at saka po ‘yung Pfizer (We are currently negotiating with big companies including Sinovac from China, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer),” Galvez told President Duterte in a televised Cabinet meeting aired on Monday night.According to Galvez, the vaccine deal with AstraZeneca is the closest to completion. He said an advance commitment could be made by November 30 for the supply of 20 million doses of their product.Once AstraZeneca’s vaccine becomes available in the market, the delivery of the country’s supply is set to commence in the second quarter of 2021.
“Nakita natin ang AstraZeneca po, maganda po dahil non-profit at saka pinakamababa po ang kanyang presyo, more or less five dollars lang (We have seen that the AstraZeneca [vaccine] is really good because it is non-profit and they have the lowest price, costing more or less five dollars [per dose]),” he said.
On the other hand, the negotiation with China’s Sinovac is being expedited through the intervention of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Inc.
Galvez said the deal could be achieved through a G2G [government-to-government] financing.
Meanwhile, the deal with Pfizer and BioNTech is also ongoing with local officials in talks with the country representatives of the two international companies.
“Just in case makuha po natin ito, makakabuo po tayo ng 60 million next year (Just in case we secure these [deals], we will come up with 60 million [doses] next year),” Galvez said.Currently, the government’s vaccine expert panel (VEP) is analyzing 17 potential vaccines, of which, nine were already in the Phase 3 trial.Phase 3 trial involves the inoculation of a wide number of people to test the vaccine’s efficacy.Of the nine vaccines that are in the advanced stages of trial, five are expected to conduct clinical trials here in the Philippines, Galvez said.
These are Sinovac, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson’s Hansen, Russia-based Gamaleya, and China’s CanSino.The race for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine is heating up as companies start to release the results of their trials.
In the Philippine setting, a vaccine should be approved first by the Department of Health and the Food and Drug Administration before it could be rolled out into the market. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Department of Finance (DOF) has identified three sources of funds for the procurement of the coronavirus vaccines that will be given to priority sectors.
In a report to President Duterte, Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said the government would source the P73.2 billion COVID-19 vaccine fund from development banks, state-owned financial companies and partner countries.
According to Dominguez, the government can obtain around P40 billion through “low-cost, long-term loans” from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank.Dominguez also said the government can tap another P20 billion from Land Bank of the Philippines, Development Bank of the Philippines and government-owned and controlled corporations.The remaining P13.2 billion will be sourced from bilateral negotiations with countries from where the vaccines would originate, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, the finance chief said.
Dominguez added that the P73.2 billion vaccine fund will enable the government to inoculate 60 million Filipinos against the coronavirus based on an average vaccine cost of P1,200 per person.
“Some [vaccine prices] are lower, some are higher so we don’t know exactly how much is the cost. But let say, $25 or P1,200, P73.2 billion is good for 60 million people to be vaccinated,” he said.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that inoculating 60 million Filipinos may enable the country to reach “herd immunity,” based on pronouncements from the World Health Organization (WHO).
“Herd immunity” is a vaccination term in which a population becomes protected from a particular virus after reaching a threshold or certain number of vaccinated people.
Duque said that according to WHO, herd immunity can be acquired if 60 to 70 percent of the population is vaccinated, which means that with 60 million inoculated Filipinos the country would “pretty much arrest the spread” of the virus.
President Duterte said the country’s poorest population, and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) will be among those to be given priority in the would-be government’s COVID-19 immunization drive. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

UNICEF said it is working with major global airlines including the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and more than 350 logistic partners for the transportation of the vaccines as soon as they become available.
“This invaluable collaboration will go a long way to ensure that enough transport capacity is in place for this historic and mammoth operation,” Director of UNICEF’s Supply Division Etleva Kadilli said in a statement.“We need all hands on deck as we get ready to deliver COVID-19 vaccine doses, syringes, and more personal protective equipment to protect front line workers around the globe. By protecting these workers, we are ultimately protecting the millions of children who depend on their critical services,” Kadili added.
In collaboration with Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), UNICEF said it will coordinate the purchase and delivery for 92 low and lower middle-income economies as quickly and securely as possible.
The agency underscored that it will continue to coordinate closely with logistics operators to minimize disruptions of delivery around the world.
“The support of governments, partners, and private sector will be paramount to transport vaccines for deadly diseases such as measles, diphtheria, and tetanus, as well as for COVID-19, as efficiently as possible,” Kadilli said.UNICEF had earlier begun to stockpile more than one billion syringes to guarantee initial supply and preposition in advance the COVID-19 vaccines.

In a meeting with President Duterte and Cabinet members Monday, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said the government has three sources of funding for the life-saving medicine, such as multilateral agencies, domestic sources, and bilateral arrangements.
Of the P73.2 billion in financial sources, Dominguez said the government could tap P40 billion in “low-cost, long-term” loans from multilateral agencies like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.On the domestic sources of financing, the country’s finance chief said an estimated P20 billion could be obtained from the Land Bank of the Philippines, Development Bank of the Philippines, and other government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCC).
The government can also negotiate with bilateral sources on vaccine purchase such as the United States and United Kingdom at around P13.2 billion, according to Dominguez.
“Ang total niyan is around P73.2 billion in financing. It’s pretty much, almost fixed. Most of it is already fixed. ‘Yung P13.2 billion hindi pa completely negotiated,” he said in a report to the President.
Dominguez said they estimated the average cost of coronavirus vaccine at around $25 or P1,200 per person. “Some are lower, some are higher so we don’t know exactly how much is the cost. But let say, $25 or P1,200. P73.2 billion is good for 60 million people to be vaccinated,” he said.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said a country may reach “herd immunity” when 60 to 70 percent of the population are vaccinated according to the World Health Organization.
“If we are able to reach that we’re going to pretty much arrest the spread of this. Mawawal ang COVID-19 sa ating lipunan,” Duque said in the same meeting with the President. “We will have herd immunity, that’s our goal mga 60 to 70 percent,” he added.
With Duque’s pronouncement, Dominguez assured that the government has the funds for the vaccine purchase.The President, in his remarks, maintained that the country’s poor must be given priority in the government’s immunization drive. He said soldiers and policemen must also be given the vaccine because he needed them “healthy” to serve in the frontlines.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the government has actually identified the recipients of its massive immunization drive as soon as the coronavirus vaccines became available even before Robredo made the suggestion to ready such list.
“We don’t have to adopt the suggestion dahil mayroon na po kaming listahan (because we already have a list),” he said during a virtual press briefing.“Thank you very much again but again po a bit too late kasi si (it’s a bit too late because) Presidente Duterte po 10 steps ahead,” he added.
Robredo recently suggested to the government to identify the beneficiaries of the potential coronavirus vaccine ahead of the distribution. She said it was important to prepare early for the vaccine distribution to avoid a repeat of lapses that marred the social amelioration program.
She also found it important for the government to ready the budget for the cold storage facilities for the vaccines. She noted that the proposed 2021 national budget included allocation for the vaccine acquisition but not for the related logistics and storage requirements.
Roque maintained that the government has made preparations for the acquisition and distribution of the coronavirus vaccines. Chief implementer of the national plan against the coronavirus Carlito Galvez Jr. has been designated by the President as vaccine czar to oversee such concern, he added.Under the government’s distribution plan, the priority recipients of the vaccines will be the health frontliners, soldiers, cops, essential workers, and the country’s poor.
“Eto nanaman tayo. ‘Pag sinabi po ng Presidente 4Ps (Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program) beneficiary, ma’am Vice President, mayroon na pong listahan ‘yan (Here we go again. When the President 4Ps beneficiary, ma’am Vice President, we already have a list),” Roque said in a sarcastic tone about the Vice President’s latest suggestion.“Maraming salamat po sa suhestiyon pero as usual, nagawa na po ng gobyerno ‘yan kasi may listahan na tayo ng 4Ps, may listahan na tayo ng kapulisan, may listahan na tayo ng kasundaluhan (Thank you for the suggestion but as usual, the government already took action because we have a list of 4Ps beneficiaries, we have a list of policemen, and we have a list of our soldiers),” he said.As to the health frontliners, Roque said the Department of Health (DoH) is also aware of the medical personnel serving in the battle against the pandemic.
Last week, the President agreed to make early payment to the suppliers of coronavirus vaccines to ensure the country’s supply.Galvez has been allowed to forge advance market commitments with the vaccine manufacturers. The vaccine purchase can be made through options such as a multilateral arrangement with World Bank and Asian Development Bank as the finance manager as well as Private-Public Tripartite Agreement.
Government officials are reportedly in talks with China, United Kingdom, and the United States for possible supply deals. Galvez said the country could be assured of 30 to 50 million coronavirus vaccines by next year. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Vice President Leni Robredo has suggested that the list of the first recipients and the budget for the storage of the expected vaccine against the coronavirus disease be prepared ahead of its distribution.
Vice President Leni Robredo (OVP / MANILA BULLETIN)
Robredo, in her weekly radio show, cited her previous briefing with health officials regarding the disposition of vaccine where she suggested that the names of those to be prioritized like the indigents and health workers must be listed down.“Iyong naalala ko, uunahin iyong mga healthcare workers, tapos iyong mga indigents. Basta lima yata o anim na prioritization, okay iyon. Pero iyong sabi ko, ang suggestion ko, pangalanan na (From what I remember, health workers will be prioritized, then the indigents. As long as the prioritization is on five or six sectors, that’s okay. But I’ve said, my suggestion is they should already be named),” she said.
“Halimbawa, health workers, dapat alam na natin, ilan ba sila? Ilan ba sila, sino sila, para kapag dumating, mayroong nang recipient, hindi gagawin natin iyong listahan kapag nandiyan na iyong vaccine (For example, for health workers, we should know how many they are, who they are, so that when the vaccine comes, we already have a list of recipients, not only when the vaccine is already available),” she added.According to President Duterte, the beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) and those who received the government’s cash aid during the pandemic will be on top of the priority list for the COVID-19 vaccination.

The vice president underscored the importance of preparing early for the vaccine distribution to prevent a repeat of the lapses in the implementation of the social amelioration program.
“Sana, habang naghihintay tayo, halimbawa dumating siya 2nd quarter of 2021, ngayon pa lang, ready na iyong listahan (I hope while we are waiting, for example if it arrives in the 2nd quarter of 2021, the list is already ready as early as now),” she said.
Robredo also pressed the need for the government to prepare the budget for proper vaccine storage given that these vaccines need to be kept in colder facilities than others.“Iyong nakabudget sa (2021) GAA (General Appropriations Act) for vaccines lang talaga, pero iyong for logistics, storage, hindi pa doon kasali. So ang suggestion ko, bakit hindi na natin i-request na magkaroon ng budget for that (The budget for 2021 is only for vaccines but the logistics, storage, are not included, so my suggestion is that why don’t we request a budget for that?),” she said.

Senator Imelda “Imee” Marcos on Sunday, Nov. 22, said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should use its clout to prod world leaders to come up with a global price ceiling for COVID-19 vaccines.

Marcos, chair of the Senate committee on economic affairs, said less developed countries remain at the mercy of global pharmaceutical firms that hold patents and dictate the prices of vaccines.
Therefore, she said, it is imperative that world leaders must agree to put a cap on the price of COVID-19, even a waiver on patents for vaccines, to ensure that less developed nations can gain access to immunization against COVID.The senator said the ASEAN, of which the Philippines is part of, should use its influence to start a new way of doing business in the manufacture, patenting, pricing and distribution of vaccines for COVID-19 and future pandemics.
She noted that the 10-member ASEAN gained more influence as a trade bloc after signing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement last week with five other non-member states including Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea.
The ASEAN can initiate a “new normal” for patents and copyrights, a world order of fairness, compassion and commitment to the common good, according to the lawmaker.
“The RCEP represents about a third of the world’s population and global [gross domestic product]. We need a global accord on COVID-19 vaccines, a standard ceiling on vaccine prices, diversified manufacturing, and supply in all world regions,” Marcos said in a statement.She also said the ASEAN must hold the group comprising the European Union (EU) and 19 member states to its official statement in March to “spare no effort, both individually and collectively, to protect lives and safeguard people’s jobs and incomes.”
Marcos also said a World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement—Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)—can be invoked to moderate vaccine patents during a global public health emergency.
“Pharmaceutical firms must not forget the priceless role of human participation in vaccine trials. No vaccine could be created without it, so it’s about time they give back to the people of the world,” she stressed.Five pharmaceutical firms are now racing to complete the four-phase trials for COVID-19 vaccine. American firm Pfizer is leading the pack. Others include US firm Moderna, UK-based Oxford/Astra-Zeneca, China’s Sinovac Biotech, and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute.
“Pfizer already made a killing on Viagra. Let’s hope the race to come up with a vaccine is guided mainly by the concern to save as many lives rather than to make as much profit as possible,” she said.
The COVID-19 Vaccine Cluster, headed by Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr. earlier said the country’s COVID-19 vaccination could begin by May 2021, barring any unforeseen issues.
According to Galvez, the government is targeting to procure an initial 24 million vaccines as President Duterte has expressed his desire to make COVID-19 vaccines accessible to the poor.
The Senate, according to Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri, is also pouring more funds for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines under the proposed P4.506-trillion national budget.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Quezon City 2nd District Rep. Precious Hipolito Castelo has urged the government to start preparing cold storage facilities for storing and safekeeping of COVID-19 vaccines in anticipation of their arrival and mass distribution to the Filipino people.
(PIXABAY / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
The House Assistant Majority Leader filed House Bill No. 8000 or the proposed “Vaccine-Ready Philippines Act of 2020” urging the government to amply prepare cold storage facilities for the vaccines.“This pandemic has taught us many things, one of which is the importance of preparation. While this pandemic is something that caught many countries and governments off guard, this is not sufficient excuse not to prepare,” she said in her bill’s explanatory note.She said the Food and Drug Administration had noted that there is a specific temperature that should be maintained in order for a vaccine not to lose its efficacy.“Countries around the world, such as India, the second most populous nation, have been preparing to ramp up its cold chain facilities for effective delivery of the vaccines when they become available,” Castelo said.“It is thus the intent of this bill to provide sufficient and appropriate cold storage equipment for storage and safekeeping of the much-anticipated COVID-19 vaccines prior to their arrival in the country. Considering that the Philippines is also a relatively populous nation, a safe and effective mass distribution of the vaccines require ample planning and preparation.”HB No. 8000 tasks the Department of Health (DOH) to determine the specifications of the cold storage facility necessary for the anticipated COVID-19 vaccines.“DOH shall urgently prepare for the provision of cold storage facilities in accordance with the specifications that are suitable for safekeeping of the anticipated COVID-19 vaccines,” the measure provides.Castelo’s bill provides that the DOH, in coordination with theInter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), shall promulgate the necessary rules and regulations to effectively implement the provisions of the proposed Act within 30 days from its effectivity.

Malacañang is hoping to see an increase in the number of Filipinos willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine once it arrives in the country, saying it is a priority program of the government.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque (RESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement after a recent Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey showed that 66 percent of Filipinos are willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine if it was available now.
Thenational mobile phone survey was conducted from Sept. 17 to 20 and covered 1,249 adult Filipinos across the country.In a statement, Roque said that the Palace was pleased with the result of the survey because it shows that many people trust the government.
“We are pleased with the results of the SWS National Mobile Phone Survey showing 66 percent of adult Filipinos are willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine,” he said.
“We view this as a positive development as this means that more Filipinos trust the current government’s vaccination program,” he added.
However, Roque said the Palace is hoping that the rest of the country would change their mind and opt to get the vaccine against COVID-19.
“We, however, hope there will be a significant increase in the number of Filipinos willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine as President Duterte wants all Filipinos to get vaccines, with priority given to the poor, indigents and other vulnerable sectors,” he said.Based on the SWS survey, 32 percent of Filipinos said they will definitely get the vaccine while 34 percent said they would probably get it.
Meanwhile, 31 percent are not willing to get the vaccine; 14 percent of which said they would probably not get it, and 17 percent remain unsure.
Malacañangannounced Thursday that President Duterte has finally agreed to make advance payments to companies making the vaccine after initially slamming Western pharmaceutical companies for seeking what he called “reservation fees.”
“Alam ko po noong una ayaw ni Presidente ‘yan pero noong nakuha po niya yung listahan ng mga bansang nag-a-advance payment, hindi naman tayo magpapahuli (I know the President was against it at first but when he saw the list of countries who are giving advance payments, we cannot allow that we will go last),” Roque said.

Of ten COVID-19 candidate vaccines in their final human trials, two reported highly promising initial results of their final Phase 3 human trials early this month.
American drugmaker Pfizer, in partnership with Germany’s BioNTech¸ announced on November 9 that tests showed that its vaccine was more than 90 percent effective in tests involving 43,000 volunteers. Pfizer CEO Albert Bouria said this may be the greatest medical advance in the last 100 years.
A week later, on November 16, Moderna, Inc., a biotechnology firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced that its vaccine was 94.5 percent effective in protecting people from infection. “These are obviously very exciting results,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. “94.5 percent is truly outstanding.”Both companies announced their findings in press releases, not in peer-reviewed journals with detailed data that outside experts could evaluate. Moderna already has a $1,5-billion contract with the US government to provide the US with 100 million doses of its vaccine under President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed.
In Geneva, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Athanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the news about the two vaccines. But the WHO right now is extremely concerned about the surge in cases, especially in Europe and the US, he said.
WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminahan said the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines appear to have high efficacy, “but there are many, many questions still remaining about the duration of protection, the impact on several diseases, the impact on different subpopulations, especially the elderly, as well as adverse events beyond a certain period of time.” Clinical trials must continue, she said, and “we are looking at least the first half of the year as being a period with very limited doses.”
In other words, there is yet no reason to believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is over and the world’s billions of people can now feel safe from getting infected because of the very positive results vaccine tests.
Tests continue for at least 42 candidate vaccines identified by the WHO. It is thus best for people to maintain at best as it can the precautionary moves that can help stop the spread of the virus.These include the wearing of face masks and face shields, maintaining one’s distance from another person, avoiding mass gatherings, avoiding touching possible carriers of infection such as door knobs and light switches, and frequent hand-washing.
We may have to keep taking these precautionary measures until at least the middle of next year, we hope we will have the vaccines ready and in quantities enough for the world’s billions of people. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

This developed as the House Committee on Peoples Participation chaired by San Jose del Monte Rep. Florida Robes lauded government movesin addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that such efforts have been commended by other countries.Dr. Aleli Annie Grace Sudiacal, representing the Department of Health’s Bureau of International Health Cooperation, disclosed that President Duterte has already approved the use of P2.5 billion in order to vaccinate some 22 million Filipinos for COVID-19 should one be made available.Appearing during the recent virtual committee meeting of the people participation panel, Sudiacal said that the President has already given his approval to use the P2.5 billion allotted for the purchase of COVID-19 under the proposed 2021 General Appropriations Act through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility.The House panel has been conducting meetings in a bid to coordinate and facilitate efforts in the development of vaccine for COVID-19.Sudiacal explained that COVAX facility, organized by the World Health Organization,is a global sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of vaccines once they are licensed and approved. It is expected to provide vaccination for 3 to 20 percent of the population or 3.2 million to 22 million Filipinos.According to her the COVAX facility pools together the world’s philanthropists, international non-governmental organizations and other groups to be able to talk to manufacturers to produce vaccines based on the need of a country, regardless of their economic standing. “This way we will be assured that manufacturers will produce the amount needed to vaccinate this eligible population,” she said.She added that the Philippines is eligible under the COVAX system because it is a low middle income country which signified its intention to be part of the system. However, the country needs to pay US$1.6 to US$2 per dose to be able to be take part in it.“As you all know we have RA 9184 or the Procurement Act which prohibits advance payment for something that is still not there. That is why we had to seek the intervention of the President and it’s very good news that the President has approved the use of the P2.5 billion allotted for the purchase of vaccines for the Philippines to have access to the COVAX facility,” she told the committee.With the President’s approval, the country may get access for around 20 percent of the population once a vaccine or several vaccines become available. She said funding will come from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.In the same hearing, Department of Science and Technology Assistant Secretary Leah Buendia said her department is currently studying the application of three vaccines for phase 3 of clinical trials, namely Sinovac from China, Sputnik V from Russia, and Johnson and Johnson from the United States.Buendia clarified that the Philippines has yet to evaluate the vaccine developed by Pfizer because the company has not submitted its application to the department.Robes for her part expressed elation over the latest vaccine development saying that it gives hope to the Filipino people who have long been hoping and praying for a vaccine for COVID-19.
“We would like to commend the tireless efforts of the President and the IATF to help our countrymen and find a vaccine. We are almost there I think. With these new developments, we will be able to go back to normal very soon,” Robes said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Nearly a million people have taken an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by Chinese company Sinopharm, the firm said, although it has not yet provided any clear clinical evidence of efficacy.

(Photo by WANG Zhao / AFP)
China has been giving experimental Covid-19 vaccines to people including state employees, international students and essential workersheading abroad since July.
Sinopharm’s chairman told media this week that nearly a million peoplehave now received their vaccine for emergency use, though he did not provide a specific figure.“We have not received a single report of severe adverse reaction, and only a few had some mild symptoms,” Liu Jingzhen said in an interview re-published by the state-owned firm on Wednesday.
China has been bullish about the development of its vaccine for the new virus — which first emerged in the centre of the country late last year — with four vaccines now in late-stage testing.
Many of the trials are taking place overseas, as China has largely brought the virus under control within its borders.
Sinopharm is testing two vaccines in late-stage trials in countries including the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina.The company claimed this week to be “leading the world in all aspects” of vaccine development, although it did not offer clinical evidence from ongoing trials.
Instead it cited anecdotal experiences from those who have been inoculated, including “construction personnel, diplomats, and overseas students” who it said have gone on to visit more than 150 countries after vaccination without being infected.
President Xi Jinping has declared that any Chinese vaccine would be a “global public good”, after the country came under criticism, particularly from the US, for its early handling of the outbreak.Many who have been inoculated in China are not formal participants in drugmakers’ trials and are said to have done so voluntarily.
Competition has intensified among pharmaceutical companies racing to develop a Covid-19 shot, with two vaccines — one by US company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and another by US firm Moderna — publishing large-scale trial data this month that showed their jabs were around 95 percent effective against Covid-19.

Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto is pushing for increased funding for the purchase and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines under the 2021 national budget.
Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto
Recto said the P18-billion proposed allocation being pushed in Senate for next year’s budget could cover only 1 in 5 Filipinos, or 20 percent of the population, even if the government purchases the cheapest vaccine available in the market.
During the Senate’s plenary debates on the Department of Health’s (DOH) proposed 2020 budget Wednesday, Senator Pia Cayetano noted that World Health Organization recommended a herd immunity of 60 percent to finally break the transmission of the disease.Cayetano said that based on the costing of the DOH, the cheapest vaccine, the one developed by AztraZeneca, will cost about P610 per person and the most expensive is the one from Chinese Sinopharm, at around P17,690 per person for two doses.
The AstraZeneca vaccine would cost the government some P15 billion to cover 24 million, or 20 percent of the population, she said.
Further, the two senators observed that there was no budget for the expenses on the storage, distribution and inoculation of the vaccine.
Cayetano said the government would need P7 billion more to cover expenses for supply chain and protective equipment for health workers, as well as post vaccination-surveillance, among others.In the initial budget proposal of the Senate, P10 billion of the P18-billion vaccine fund are placed under the unprogrammed appropriations, or those that are available when government revenue collection exceed targets or when additional grants or foreign funds are generated.
Recto proposed to appropriate as unprogrammed funds at least P20 billion and another P20 billion for the delivery of the vaccines.
“The cost of this pandemic to our economy this year will roughly be P1.9 trillion, the contraction of the economy. The lost opportunity is roughly another P1.9 trillion and here we are haggling with what? P50 billion?” he said.
“The distribution probably will be more expensive than the vaccine itself,” he said.
Cayetano shared Recto’ s view, calling on her colleagues support for more allocation for the vaccines.
Recto said on Thursday that he is optimistic that the government will be able to address the possible challenges that the COVID-19 immunization would pose. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

TheCOVID-19 candidate vaccines of Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm from China and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute have been given EUAs by their governments.
Domingo noted that EUAs from other countries cannot be used for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines here.“Maga-apply din po siya dito ng EUA although titingnan natin probably ‘yung same evidence na ano ’yung pinakita nila doon sa bansa na kung saan sila nakakuha ng unang authority (They also need to apply for EUA here, although we will probably look at the same evidence they submitted to countries where they first got an EUA),” said Domingo.

Concepcion said that he is already coordinating with the country’s vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. and the president of the “aforementioned pharmaceutical company.”
He said that the idea came from BDO Chairman Tessie Sy-Coson “who was already in discussion with the pharmaceutical company.”
“A portion of this donation will be allotted to the frontliners and vulnerable workers in the business sector following the guidelines set on the priority sector by the government,” said Concepcion.Concepcion stressed that it is important that the Philippines will not be left behind when it comes to vaccine supply, which is expected to become available by next year.“This is very important as it giveshope to our Filipino people, especially our MSMEs (micro, small, and medium enterprises), to hang on and that government and the private sector is working together to make it happen,” said Concepcion.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the announcement following reports that the vaccine being developed by Pfizer is 95 percent effective against COVID-19.
Pfizer vaccinePfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday a completed analysis of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine found it protected 95 percent of people against the disease and announced they were applying for US emergency approval “within days.”
The news from the US pharmaceutical company and its German partner brought further hope to a world upended by the coronavirus pandemic, and follows an announcement last week in which they said a preliminary analysis showed the product was 90 percent effective.
Adding to the encouraging data was that the efficacy was found to be consistent across all age-groups – a primary concern for a disease that hits the elderly the hardest – as well as genders and ethnicities.
“The study results mark an important step in this historic eight-month journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end this devastating pandemic,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.
Moderna vaccine
On Monday, US biotech firm Moderna said the two-dose vaccine it developed with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) was 94.5 percent effective, according to a preliminary analysis.
Both vaccines use mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology to deliver genetic material to the body that makes human cells create a protein from the virus. This trains the immune system to be ready to attack if it encounters SARS-CoV-2.
“These achievements highlight the potential of mRNA as a new drug class,” BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said.There are important differences between the two vaccines. Pfizer’s needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (- 94 degrees Fahrenheit) while Moderna’s only needs -20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit), more akin to a regular freezer.
Duterte EO out soon
In his Thursday presser, Roque said that President Duterte will soon issue an executive order (EO), through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that will authorize the emergency use of vaccines as long as these were already approved by the FDA in their respective countries of origin.
“Hindi pa po naglalabas ni Presidente ang Executive Order (The President has not issued the EO yet),” he said.
“‘Pag nilabas na po ‘yan ni Presidente mapapabilis po yung proseso ng paggamit ng mga bakuna na meron na ring authorization sa mga FDAs ng mga bansa kung saan na-develop ang mga vaccine (When the EO comes out, the process before one can get the vaccine will be faster as long as these vaccines are already approved by their respective FDAs),” he added.
According to Roque, with the EO, it will take only 21 days before a person can get the vaccine.“Kung mapipirmahan po itong Executive Order na ito, 21 araw na lang po magagamit na rin natin sa Pilipinas (Once the EO is signed, we’ll only have to wait for 21 days before the vaccine can be used here in the Philippines),” he said.
“Dati-rati po, bago magamit ang isang bakuna dito na approved na ng US o Chinese FDA, kinakailangan muna ng anim na buwan ng pagsusuri (Back then, before we can use a vaccine that is already approved by the US or Chinese FDA, we need to wait for six months of testing),” he added.
In the same press briefing, Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said that the country is looking at 17 possible vaccines to bring into the country.
“Marami na tayong kinakausap na vaccine companies at saka maganda ang ating (We’ve been talking to many vaccine companies and we have good) relationship with different countries,” he said.
“Iyong companies na sponsored nila ay may naka-allocate na quota sa atin (The companies that these countries have sponsored have allocated a quota for us),” he added.
However, Galvez said that they are recommending that there should still be a clinical trial of the said vaccines in the Philippines.
Modes of procurement
Meanwhile, Roque enumerated the different methods of how the Philippines can procure COVID-19 vaccines. He said one is direct procurement through the Government Procurement Reform Act or the Bayanihan To Recover As One Act.
He said the country can also enter into multilateral loans like the Asian Development Bank-World Bank Project Loan for Vaccine. Another way is through bilateral loans.
Roque likewise hailed the private sector for committing to pay for 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine where 50-80 percent will go to the government and the rest will be given to their employees.
Arriving soon
According to Galvez, the country can get hold of Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine called Sputnik V by the first quarter of 2021.
He said that the government is targeting to vaccinate 25 million Filipinos next year and this is possible because the Philippines has good diplomatic relationships with both China and the US which is giving the country “a lot of allocations.”
Galvez added that the government is targeting to get 30 million to 50 million doses from the said firms that they are in contact with.
Meanwhile, Roque reminded the public that while COVID-19 vaccines are arriving in the country soon, they should still follow quarantine and health protocols to avoid catching the disease.
“So konting tulog na lang mga kaibigan, mga kababayan. Pero habang wala pang bakuna, mask, hugas, iwas (We don’t have to wait that long. But while we’re waiting, wear your mask, wash your hands, and practice physical distancing),” he said.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the announcement following reports that the vaccine being developed by Pfizer has been ascertained to be 95 percent effective against the infectious disease.
In his Thursday presser, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said President Duterte did not want the country to be left behind.“Medyo pumayag na po tayo na magkakaroon po tayo ng advance (He finally allowed advance payments),” he said.
“Kasi ‘pag hindi po tayo pumayag, eh baka mangulelat tayo sa mga bansa na makakakuha ng vaccine (If we didn’t agree to this, we might be left behind compared to other countries who will be getting the vaccines),” he added.
According to Roque, the President changed his mind about rejecting companies that seek advance payments after seeing the list of countries that paid in advance.
“Alam ko po noong una ayaw ni Presidente ‘yan pero noong nakuha po niya yung listahan ng mga bansang nag-a-advance payment, hindi naman tayo magpapahuli (I know the President was against it at first but when he saw the list of countries who are giving advance payments, we cannot allow that we will go last),” he said.The Palace official reiterated that the government will make the advance payments as long as there are funds for it because the country needs the vaccine.
“Basta meron naman tayong pondo, kung kinakailangan ibenta ang mga ari-arian ng gobyerno, gagawin niya ‘yan (As long as we have the funds. If we have to sell government assets, then so be it),” Roque said.
“Pero dahil nga importanteng masiguro na meron tayong bakuna, pumayag na po siya noong mga tinatawag na advance payments (But since it is important to ensure that we have the vaccine, he agreed to make the advance payment),” he added.
Last September, President Duterte said he will not spend a single peso to pay a “reservation fee” to pharmaceutical companies that have yet to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, saying it is against the country’s procurement laws. President Duterte said such companies are not welcome in the Philippines because they are just looking for someone who will finance their research and development activities.
“Kita’y mugasto sa ilang pag-imbento ug pagtrabaho sa ilang vaccine. Mupalit unya ko sa ila, itusok nako ang vaccine sa ilang utok kay mga gago ang mga buang (They want us to finance their experiment and development of their vaccine. I will buy the vaccine from them and inject it into their brains because they are crazy),” he said.
“Better get out of this country, we don’t need you,” Duterte said at that time. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The country has no existing ultra high cold chain storage for vaccines against the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), said a vaccine expert of the Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday (Nov. 19).

“Actually, in the Philippines, we have available only for positive eight degrees vaccines and also the negative 20 degrees vaccines,” Luzviminda Garcia of the DOH Disease Prevention and Control Bureau.
“But in terms of the negative 70 and 40 we don’t have,” she admitted.Vaccine experts warned that if vaccines won’t be potent if these are not stored under the required temperature.
Despite this, Garcia assured that the bureau has already talked to logistics companies concerning their ultra cold chain capacities.
“From a negative 20, according to them, they can convert it to a negative 70 but it will take them two months to convert these equipment,” she disclosed.
Once the vaccines become available, Garcia said those who want to get vaccinated will have to go the hospitals.“We cannot transport the vaccine if it requires negative 70 to the health centers,” she explained.
“So we will request all our target eligible population to go to the hospital to receive the vaccine because of the problem of transporting it,” Garcia added.
Garcia said that a P3 billion budget will be required to vaccinate a population of 25 million Filipinos and this already includes costs for the purchase of the vaccine, ultra high cold storage, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the disposal. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Pia Cayetano on Wednesday stressed the need for Congress to appropriate sufficient funding for the health sector so the government can procure COVID-19 vaccines, sustain the cold chain, buy syringes and other equipment as soon as the vaccines for the coronavirus is already available in the market.
Sen. Pia Cayetano
Cayetano, vice chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and who is tasked to defend the Department of Health (DOH) and its attached agencies’ proposed budget for 2021, said it is imperative that the DOH is able to cover the identified priority groups of around 24 million vulnerable Filipinos which make up around 20 percent of the country’s population.Since the Philippines is now part of the COVAX facility, Cayetano said the government has the assurance of getting vaccines for three to 20 percent of the population.“So how much do we have to allocate to cover these priority groups? Based on the costing of DOH, we need to allocate at least P15-billion, if we purchase Aztrazeneca vaccine, which is the cheapest at around P610 per person,” Cayetano said during the Senate plenary debates on the proposed P4.506-trillion national budget for 2021.She said the government also has another option of buying vaccine from Sinopharm, which is the highest priced at around P17,690 per person for two doses. The government has to allocate P436.3-billion for China’s Sinopharm vaccines. Prices of other potential COVID-19 vaccines fall in between.“Experts recommend that we purchase from various suppliers. Why? Well, given that there may be possible side effects, we would rather spread out our risk throughout the population and minimize the chances that we are all exposed to one particular vaccine and any particular side effects they have,” she said.“It cannot be overemphasized that these amounts only cover the cost of vaccines and do not include consumables and other logistics that go into delivering the vaccine to the individual that needs it,” the senator stressed.Besides the acquisition of COVID-19 vaccines, the government has to consider other expenses particularly the cold/supply chain to ensure that the vaccines are in tightly controlled temperatures before it is administered to a person.She also said the government has to fund the training and personal protective equipment (PPEs) for the vaccinators, needles, syringes and other critical equipment.“These are things that have to be purchased in advance, considering that the entire world is also trying to get hold of them during this global crisis,” she pointed out.Considering that the DOH may not be also equipped to handle the supply chain requirements for COVID-19 vaccines, she said the government should be outsourcing, discussing, negotiating with private companies that are already equipped to handle such vaccines.“Wala hong masama na magtulong-tulong tayo. Whole-of-society, whole-of-nation dapat ang approach natin,” Cayetano said.According to Cayetano, the DOH and its attached agencies, including the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) has a proposed budget of P212.7-billion for next year.The Senate minority bloc earlier urged other members of the Upper Chamber to realign some funds lodged in the government’s anti-insurgency program to fund the government’s COVID-19 efforts.

Students are the 12th and last in the list of priorities as soon as a COVID-19 vaccine is approved and made available to the country, the Department of Health (DOH) disclosed Wednesday.

In a briefing given to the House Committee on People’s Participation by government agencies involved in the COVID-19 vaccination, DOH representative, Dr. Aleli Annie Grace Sudiacal, made it clear that the prioritization of sectors lining up for vaccine protection will only be carried out based on the availability of supply.
“We hope people will not misconstrue that they are not priority,” Sudiacal, director of the Bureau of International Health Cooperation, stressed.
San Jose del Monte Rep. Rida Robes, chairperson of the people’s participation panel, said the prioritization list is clearly based on close analysis of the COVID-19 situation, adding that vaccine czar and national task force on COVID -19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez is for swiftly addressing the prioritization issue.“IATF’s handling of the anti-pandemic program has also been cited by other countries as successful.We found solutions to the worst problems faced by the country,” Robes said.
The priority eligible groups as presented by Sudiacal:First priority:Frontline health workers numbering about 1,762,994 from both public and private sector;Second priority: Indigent senior citizens estimated at around 3,789,874 in numberThird priority; Remaining 5,678,544 senior citizensFourth Priority – Remaining indigent population estimated at 12,911,193Fifth priority – Uniformed personnel, 525,5236th Priority – Teachers and school workers in both private and public institutions7th Priority – All government workers from national agencies and local government units8th Priority – Essential workers in agriculture, food industry, transportation, and tourism9th Priority –Sociodemographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigent populations such as persons deprived of liberty; persons with disabilities, and Filipinos living in high density areas;10th Priority – Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs)11th Priority – Other remaining work force12th Priority – Students
Sudiacal said that a prioritization list has become imperative because “we do not know yet the kind of vaccine to be approved and when it will come out.”She noted countries grappling with the dangers of the COVID-19 pandemic are also lining up to access the first available vaccine that will be manufactured.
“We really have to prioritize based on the available supply,” the DOH official explained.Nevertheless, Sudiacal assured lawmakers that the Philippines has a good “fighting chance” of accessing the first available and effective anti-COVID 19 vaccine thru the COVAX facility of the World Health Organization.
“We will not rely on one source. Maraming bansa nag-aagawan nangunit tayo naman ay kumakausapthrough bilateral discussion and exploratory discussions directly to manufacturers (There are many countries competing but we have started discussions)” said Sudiacal.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Department of Health (DOH) reiterated its assurance that all potential COVID-19 vaccines —- that will enter the Philippines — will undergo a strict regulatory process to ensure its efficacy and safety.
(PIXABAY / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“As I’ve said, all of the vaccines that will come into the country should be able to undertake itong regulatory process na meron tayo dito [this regulatory process that we have here],” said DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in an online forum Wednesday.Vergeire asked the public to trust the government’s process when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines.
“The population or our Filipino public should just trust na ang proseso ng gobyerno ay sisiguraduhin na ligtasat saka magiging epektibo ang mga bakunang papapasukin natin dito sa ating bansa [The population or our Filipino public should just trust that the government’s process will ensure that the vaccines we will bring into our country are safe and effective],” she added.Update on potential independent clinical trials
The Health official said that the American Biotech company Moderna is not keen in conducting a clinical trial in the Philippines for its COVID-19 candidate vaccine.“Ang Moderna, nakausap na sila ng Department of Science and Technology about a month ago and ang kanilang intent is not to have a clinical trial in the Philippines but they would want na doon na sila papasok sa vaccine procurement [Moderna already talked to the Department of Science and Technology about a month ago and their intent is not to have a clinical trial in the Philippines but they would want to enter (a negotiations) for vaccine procurement],” said Vergeire.Vergeire said that they would have wanted for the American firm to conduct clinical trials in the Philippines to test the efficacy of their candidate vaccine.“Ang objective ng Pilipinas ay magkaroon ng clinical trials dito ang mga manufacturers so that we can see the effect of these vaccines among our population kasi sabi nga natin iba-iba ang epekto ng bakuna sa bawa’t race, so mas maganda makikita natin [The objective of the Philippines is for manufacturers to have clinical trials here so that we can see the effects of these vaccines among our population because it can have different effects to every race. It would be ideal if we can see its effects in our population],” she said.Not having conductedclinical trials here, Vergeire said, would not prevent the Philippines from procuring proven and approved vaccines from their manufacturers.“If the manufacturer will not conduct a clinical trial here in the country, hindi po iyan makakaapekto sa pagpili natin. Although of course, that is the ideal…but if they do not intend, hindi po naman iyan makakapag stop sa gobyerno para mag procure tayo as long as they would go through the regulatory process [If the manufacturer will not conduct a clinical trial here in the country, that will not affect our selection process. Although of course, that is the ideal… but if they do not intend, that will not stop the government in procuring as long as they would go through the regulatory process],” she said.
Moderna recently announced that its candidate vaccine posted 94.5 percent efficacy based on the preliminary results of their clinical trials.Meanwhile, the application ofChina’s Sinovac Biotech for holding clinical trials in the Philippines is still being reviewed by the health authorities, said Vergeire.“They are just completing some documentary requirements for our Ethics Review Board while the Food and Drug Administration is already conducting an initial evaluation,” said Vergeire.Sinovac already passed the evaluation of the vaccine experts panel of the Department of Science and Technology.Indian vaccine maker
Serum Institute of India (SII) has committed to make its COVID-19 candidate vaccine available to the Philippines once it is already developed.
Faberco Life Sciences Inc,a local pharmaceutical distributor, said it was authorized by SII to “represent it in the Philippines for the supply of the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Novovax.”
“The President himself has expressed doubts if the Philippines will get vaccines being developed in the West. If and when the vaccine becomes available, SII and Faberco hope to bring a pleasant surprise,” Faberco Life Sciences medical director Dr. Luningning Villa said in a statement.The vaccine being developed by SII and Novovax is set to start the phase three trials in the United States this month.“SII has become a supplier of choice for those looking for high quality vaccines and India has a good track record and enjoys a high level of trust,” said Villa.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III has proposed the emergency use of coronavirus vaccines once they arrive in the country to hasten the processing of their regulatory approval.
President Rodrigo Roa Duterte presides over a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) core members prior to his talk to the people at the Malacañang Golf (Malago) Clubhouse in Malacañang Park, Manila on November 17, 2020. (ALFRED FRIAS/ PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
In a meeting on the government’s pandemic response Tuesday night, Duque asked President Duterte to allow the Food And Drug Administration (FDA) to issue the emergency use authorization (EUA) for vaccines, medicines, and technologies to fight the spread of the new coronavirus disease.
EUAs are applied to justify the use of certain medical products during a public health emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent life-threatening disease or condition.“We are respectfully requesting that you consider the issuance of an executive order for FDA to grant an Emergency Use Authorization for the various vaccines that will enter the country and for which applications are to be filed,” Duque said in a report to the President.
“Para mabilis po ito, it will cut the processing time from six months to about 21 days, Mr. President. So it will cut the red tape and, again, that is for your consideration,” he added.
Duque said the EUA will facilitate the approval of medical products and technologies during the pandemic through the process of “reliance and recognition.”
He said reliance refers to the FDA’s trust in the evaluation made by other national regulatory authorities abroad in deciding on a medical product’s application in the country. Recognition, on the other hand, is FDA’s routine acceptance of the regulatory decision of the other regulatory authorities or trusted institutions.Duque explained that EUA is used when there is a medical health emergency, a serious or life-threatening disease, proof that the product may be effective to prevent, diagnose, or treat a disease, positive risk/benefit balance, and when there is no adequate or approved alternative available.
“Ang FDA ay mariin na magsasagawa po ng post-marketing surveillance activities at ang EUA maaaring i-revise or i-revoke ng FDA kung kinakailangan upang maprotektahan ang kalusugan (The FDA will conduct post-marketing surveillance activities and may revise or revoke the EUA if needed to protect public health),” he said.
In the same meeting with the President, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. backed Duque’s proposal for the issuance of the emergency use of coronavirus vaccines in the country.Galvez, chief implementer of the government’s action plan to combat the pandemic, said the country could be assured of 30 million to 50 million doses by next year. “Pagka nag-roll out po ang ibang bansa (Once other countries roll out the vaccines), we can also have our rollout here,” he told the President.
He said the country has 17 possible sources of coronavirus vaccines abroad. Of the 17 potential vaccines, Galvez said nine products are undergoing phase three clinical trials. On the last stage of clinical studies, three potential vaccines will undergo trials in the country this December and January.
Galvez also recommended that the government should take the “advance market commitment” by the end of the year through the multilateral arrangement with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank as finance managers.
“At the same time, we also have to have various modes of financing including Private-Public Tripartite Agreement without the cost with the government,” he said.
Galvez said the private sector also intends to buy supplies directly from the vaccine company but subject to the regulation of the health department. “The DOH will be the one who will know, who will decide where the vaccine will be given,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senate leaders aired on Tuesday their reservations on the Philippine International Trading Corporation’s (PITC) ability to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for the country once supplies are available.
Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said the Department of Trade and Industry-attached corporation might not be able to deliver on time the vaccines that the government would ask it to procure.
During the chamber’s plenary debates on the proposed budget of the Department of Interior and Local Government and its attached agencies, he cited the delays in the PITC’s procurements on behalf of government agencies like the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, among others, whose funds for such purchases were made available since 2016.“In fact, their (PITC) track record doesn’t seem to be good. As I have pointed out, dito sa (here in the) PNP, it took them four years, and then ngayon, pangakong ide-deliver. Eh paano na ‘pag vaccine ‘yan, baka apat na taon hindi pa rin dumating (What if these are vaccines, it might take four years and still not arrive)?” Recto said.
Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara giggled at Recto’s comparison, saying: “Obsolete na ‘yong vaccine (The vaccines will be obsolete)…by that time.”
“Wala kang inoculate, namatay na lahat (You failed to inoculate, everyone already died of COVID-19),” Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon followed.
President Duterte had tasked the PITC to facilitate the purchase COVID-19 vaccines from abroad. Under his initial plan, the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines will provide a P20-billion loan to PITC, which will then sell the vaccines to the Department of Health for distribution to poor beneficiaries.Lawmakers, on the other hand, set aside P8 billion for vaccine purchase in the 2021 General Appropriations Bill, and another P10 billion in unprogrammed funds to be released once government resources are available.Drilon supported Recto’s earlier proposal that the PITC waive its four-percent commission not only for procuring the vaccines, but also for other projects that its services were tapped.
“I don’t want to think that it is this commission which influences the various government offices from availing of the services of PITC…That is why we are supporting, and probably if we can move that part of the special provisions is a provision which will prohibit the payment of commission to PITC, not only in COVID[-19] but in all other cases, as Senator Recto said,” he said.
The senators said the fondness of agencies to outsource their procurements through the PITC should be stopped.Recto, who called the practice as “pasa-buy”, said this also gives Congress a false sense of security that the agencies have already disbursed and obligated the funds that were appropriated to them, and in turn will shortchange the public since the needed government services were not delivered to them.
“It is a way to make it appear that an agency has obligated its budget. And in truth and in fact, it is just another layer, and there has not been a significant process made in terms of procurement or actual disbursement of budget, your honor,” Angara agreed.
“Yes, it’s a practice, it can be deceptive at times,” he continued. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque mentioned the country’s potential vaccine supply from the United States after another biotech company announced a breakthrough in vaccine development.
“We have firm commitments from the United States, relayed to (Foreign Affairs) Secretary (Teodoro) Locsin (Jr.) by no less than (US State) Secretary (Mike) Pompeo, that we will have access to COVID vaccines that may be developed in the United States,” Roque said during a televised press conference.Roque has welcomed the announcement of Moderna, Inc. that its experimental vaccine against the coronavirus appeared highly effective, saying this was “good news.”
The efficacy of the Moderna vaccine came a week after the promising results from Pfizer about its vaccine in reducing the risk of coronavirus infection. Both companies reportedly used the same technology to make their vaccines.“Punta muna po tayo sa ating mga balita, mabuting balita naman po ito: Inanunsiyo po ng Moderna na ang kanilang bakuna laban sa COVID-19 ay 94.5% effective base sa resulta ng kanilang clinical trial (Let’s to other news, this is good news: Moderna announced that their COVID-19 vaccine is 94.5 percent effected based on the results of their clinical trial),” Roque said.
“Kung inyong matatandaan, noong isang linggo lamang, inanunsiyo naman ng Pfizer na ang kanilang vaccine ay more than 90% effective. Anong ibig sabihin nito? Well, palapit na palapit na po ang pagkakaroon ng bakuna laban sa COVID-19 (If you remember, just last week, Pfizer announced its vaccine is more than 90 percent effective. What does this mean? Well, our vaccine against COVID-19 is forthcoming),” he said.Pfizer earlier announced its potential vaccine was more than 90 percent effective in preventing the disease.
Apart from the US commitment, Roque said the country has secured an assurance from China about a potential coronavirus vaccine supply. He said Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised President Duterte about supplying Chinese-made vaccines to the Philippines.
Roque said the United Kingdom has also committed to the World Health Organization about giving access to vaccines to poor countries.Earlier, Russia has offered to supply coronavirus vaccines to the Philippines, which President Duterte has accepted.
Pending the COVID-19 vaccine production, Roque appealed anew to the public to continue to observe health protocols such as wearing of mask, frequent washing of hands and observing safe distancing from others.
Malacañang, meantime, is also thankful for the reported drop in thecoronavirus positivity rate in Metro Manila. He credited the public for cooperating with the government in curbng the spread of the disease.
“We are now back to the acceptable range as set by the WHO (World Health Organization) na ang positivity rate should be less than 5 percent. At 4 percent, patunay po iyan na ang mga taga-Metro Manila ay nais po talagang pangalagaan ang kanilang kalusugan para sila po ay makapaghanapbuhay na (At 4 percent, it proves Metro Manila residents want to protect their health so they can get back to work),” he said.

Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto on Tuesday called on the government not to abandon its contact tracing efforts while the country waits for a vaccine against COVID-19.
(JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)
No funds were allocated for the contact tracing program under the P4.506-trillion 2021 government spending plan, said Senator Juan Edgardo Angara during the plenary debates on the Department of Interior and Local Government’s (DILG) P244-billion proposed budget.
“Unlike what we put in Bayanihan 2, there is no similar item [in the 2021 budget]. There is none, your honor, yes,” Angara told Recto.The DILG was given a P5-billion fund under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act to hire and train 50,000 contact tracers and augment the personnel employed by the government to track down close contacts of COVID-19 patients. It said it so far hired 46,338.
For their 2021 budget, however, Angara said the DILG did not request for continued appropriation for the program.
Speaking for DILG Secretary Eduardo Año who was in the Senate plenary, Angara said the agency does not intend to totally abandon it and will continue to supervise the contact tracing activities of the local government units (LGUs), the police, and the Bureau of Fire Protection.
He also said that the DILG hopes that the additional contact tracers it hired under the Bayanihan 2 would be absorbed by LGUs so they can continue to do their work.
But Recto doubted that LGUs will still have funds to pay for the services of the contact tracers, saying that they have already spent a significant amount for their constituents during the pandemic, and the calamities that hit their areas this year.
“Let’s say, the province of Batangas, kasi tinamaan din ng Taal Volcano ‘yan (which was affected by eruption of the Taal Volcano), so their local government revenues next year will be less tha this year, including local revenues because of the pandemic. Babagsak ang revenues (Their revenues will decline) similar to the national government,” he pointed out.
“Kung walang budget (If there is no budget) for contact tracing, it would appear to me that we are abandong it. Walang pondo rin ang LGU (LGUs also do not have the funds) for that,” Recto said.
Recto further said: “My worry is that if we abandon [it] — because of the P4.5 trillion budget for next year, there is no amount of money for contact tracing — I don’t know if that’s wise if we abandon contact tracing immediately.”
“Mabuti na ‘yong naninigurado tayo at marami namang walang trabaho ngayon, eh ‘di mabuti nagbibigay din naman tayo ng trabaho (It’s better that we are proactive and since many lost their jobs, it’s good that we are providing jobs for them). And with the mission of ensuring, habang wala pa ‘yong (while we are waiting for the) vaccine, that we continue what we are doing,” he added.
Angara agreed with Recto’s view and said he would ask the DILG to submit an estimate on how many LGUs to absorb the 50,000 contact tracers hired under Bayanihan 2.
There are over 257,000 contact tracers across the country to date, the DILG said in its update to senators. Around 55 percent of LGUs in the country were capacitated to conduct contact tracing.
Contact tracing is part of the T3 or “Test, Trace, Treat” approach being followed by the national government to address the COVID-19 outbreak in the Philippines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said it will extend technical assistance to developing countries, like the Philippines, to help them secure access to a coronavirus vaccine as well as in their distribution.
In a statement, the Manila-based multilateral institution said it earmarked $20.3 million in technical assistance to  help its developing members access vaccines for COVID-19 and establish system s to enable equitable and efficient distribution.
The funds will support vaccine-related health system assessments and the development of country readiness plans to strengthen the capacity to access, introduce, deploy, deliver, and monitor vaccines safely and effectively, ADB said.
The bank also added the funds will help members assess and strengthen vaccine cold chain and logistics, infection control, supply and skills of health workers, risk communications, and real-time data capturing and monitoring.Lastly, ADB said the technical assistance will support the identification and promotion of innovative cold chain and vaccine tracking technologies.While the Asia and the Pacific region has largely done well in COVID-19 response, Woochong Um, ADB director general for sustainable development and climate Change, noted that ensuring access to a safe, effective, and equitable vaccine is the next frontier in the fight against the virus.
“With these additional grant resources, ADB can immediately support our developing members to undertake urgent actions, including vaccine system assessments and vaccine deployment strategies, to ensure vaccines are delivered efficiently and fairly,” Um said.
ADB expects to implement the technical assistance with its partners UNICEF and the World Health Organization, in coordination with COVAX, Gavi, the World Bank, bilateral agencies, among others.
The funds comprise $20 million from ADB’stechnical assistance special fund (TASF) and $300,000 from the High-Level Technology Fund financed by the Government of Japan.ADB already approved a $20 billion expanded assistance package in April to support its developing members’ COVID-19 response.Earlier, President Duterte said his government can borrow $300 million to purchase the coronavirus vaccines for distribution to Filipinos.
As soon as more vaccine supply becomes available, Duterte committed that the government would give priority to the country’s poor in the distribution of the life-saving drug SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Abadilla,"Published November 17, 2020, 9:28 AM","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) last night (Nov 16) released its guidance to ensure that the air cargo industry can support the large-scale handling, transport and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine.IATA’s Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution provides recommendations for governments and the logistics supply chain in preparation for what will be the largest and most complex global logistics operation ever undertaken. “Delivering billions of doses of a vaccine that must be transported and stored in a deep-frozen state to the entire world efficiently will involve hugely complex logistical challenges across the supply chain,” stressed IATA’s Director General and CEO, Alexandre de Juniac.
“While the immediate challenge is the implementation of COVID-19 testing measures to re-open borders without quarantine, we must be prepared for when a vaccine is ready,” he added.‘This guidance material is an important part of those preparations.”Key challenges addressed in IATA’s Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution include the availability of temperature-controlled storage facilities and contingencies when such facilities are not availableThr roles and responsibilities of parties involved in the distribution of vaccines, particularly government authorities and NGOs, should also be defined.Industry preparedness for vaccine distribution includes capacity and connectivity: The global route network has been reduced dramatically from the pre-COVID 22,000 city pairs.Governments need to re-establish air connectivity to ensure adequate capacity is available for vaccine distribution.Facilities and infrastructure ste vital.
The first vaccine manufacturer to apply for regulatory approval requires the vaccine to be shipped and stored in a deep-frozen state, making ultra-cold chain facilities across the supply chain essential.Some types of refrigerants are classified as a dangerous goods and volumes are regulated which adds an additional layer of complexity. Considerations include availability of temperature-controlled facilities and equipment and staff trained to handle time- and temperature-sensitive vaccines.Timely regulatory approvals and storage and clearance by customs and health authorities will be essential.Priorities for border processes include introducing fast-track procedures for overflight and landing permits for operations carrying the COVID-19 vaccine and potential tariff relief to facilitate the movement of the vaccine.Vaccines are highly valuable commodities. Arrangements must be in place to ensure that shipments remain secure from tampering and theft.Processes are in place already, but the huge volume of vaccine shipments will require early planning to ensure that they are scalable.Reflecting the complexity of the challenge, the Guidance was produced with the support of a broad range of partners, includingthe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA),International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) , UK Civil Aviation Authority, World Bank,World Customs Organization (WCO) andWorld Trade Organization (WTO).The guidance includes a repository of international standards and guidelines related to the transport of vaccines and will be updated regularly as information is made available to the industry.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

GENEVA – Reported breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccine research are “encouraging,” World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday, but voiced concern about surging cases and warned against complacency.

“We continue to receive encouraging news about COVID-19 vaccines,” Tedros told a virtual press briefing.
Tedros, who has just spent more than two weeks in quarantine after coming in contact with someone with COVID-19, said he was “cautiously optimistic” that new tools would start to arrive in the coming months.But he added: ”This is no time for complacency.”
His comments came as hopes of trials of a second candidate vaccine suggested it was nearly 95 percent effective against the virus.
“The idea that we have a 94.5 percent effective vaccine is stunningly impressive. It is really a spectacular result that I don’t think anybody had anticipated it would be this good,” said United States’ top infectious disease scientist Anthony Fauci on Monday.
Fauci leads the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which began co-developing the vaccine with the US biotech company in January, shortly after China shared the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus.
It is based on a relatively new technology that uses a synthetic version of a molecule called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine making factories.
No vaccine based on this platform has ever been approved.
‘The data speak for themselves’
The news from US biotech firm Moderna follows a similarly impressive result from American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech last week, who reported an efficacy of 90 percent for their vaccine.
Asked whether it was too early to say if mRNA technology had now been proven, Fauci – who is usually known for his cautious statements – said the jury was definitely in.
“I think when you have two vaccines like this, that have proven to be greater than 90 percent effective, I think that mRNA is here, it’s established itself, it doesn’t need to prove anything anymore.
“The data speak for themselves; it isn’t me, it isn’t my opinion – look at the data,” Fauci said.
Traditional virus vaccines use actual viruses that have to be grown in chicken eggs or fetal cell lines and then weakened so they don’t harm people – a process that can take many months.
By contrast, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines deliver the genetic information needed to create a protein that lies on the surface of the virus – called the spike protein – directly to cells in the human body, which then grow it.
This primes the immune system to make antibodies to the actual virus, and has the major advantage of shortening vaccine development time to a matter of weeks, once scientists have the genetic sequence of the protein they want to create.
‘Playing with fire’
But WHO has warned that widespread availability of any vaccine remains a long way off, and COVID-19 cases and deaths are surging in many parts of the world.
”Those countries that are letting the virus run unchecked are playing with fire,” Tedros said.
He voiced particular alarm about the situation in Europe and the Americas, where he said health workers and systems were being pushed to breaking point.
”A laissez-faire attitude to the virus … leads to death, suffering and hurts livelihoods and economies,” he said.
”The quickest way to open up economies is to defeat the virus.”
The UN agency’s headquarters is experiencing its own outbreak of coronavirus, with Tedros spending 17 days in quarantine – though he said he had not developed any symptoms.
Five new cases within the same WHO team have been registered in the past week, WHO official Maria Van Kerkhove said.
”We don’t know if there is an actual cluster,” she said, adding that experts were trying to work out if transmission had happened on the premises.
WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan stressed that the Geneva region is experiencing ”some of the most intense transmission in the world right now”.
”We are human beings and we live within a society,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

US biotech firm Moderna on Monday announced its experimental vaccine against Covid-19 was almost 95 percent effective, marking a second major breakthrough in the quest to end the pandemic.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are based on a new technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories
Moderna released early results from a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants, after American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech last week said their vaccine was 90 percent effective.Both frontrunners are based on new technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.“This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease, including severe disease,” said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel.
“Today’s news of a second vaccine is further reason to feel hopeful,” tweeted President-elect Joe Biden, but he cautioned that its widespread distribution was months away.
“Until then, Americans need to continue to practice social-distancing and mask-wearing to get the virus under control,” he said.
Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval around the world within weeks, and says it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.
The company, which has received $2 billion from the US government under “Operation Warp Speed,” added it is on track to manufacture between 500 million to a billion doses globally in 2021.
Global infections from Covid-19 have soared past 54 million with more than 1.3 million deaths since the virus emerged in China late last year.
President Donald Trump also weighed in on Twitter, to take credit. “Please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!”– Beginning of the end? –
The Moderna vaccine, which was co-developed by the US National Institutes of Health, is given in two doses 28 days apart, and the preliminary results are based on the 95 of the 30,000 volunteers who fell ill with Covid-19.
Of the 95, 90 had been in the trial’s placebo group, and five in the group that received the drug, called mRNA-1273, translating to an efficacy rate of 94.5 percent.
There were 11 people who fell severely ill, all of whom were in the placebo group.
A small fraction of people experienced severe symptoms such as fatigue, muscle and joint pains, or redness at the injection site, but these side-effects were short lasting.
“The light at the end of the tunnel just got even brighter,” tweeted Atul Gawande, a member of Biden’s coronavirus advisory board and a surgeon at a Harvard-affiliated hospital.
Crucially, Moderna also announced that its vaccine can remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 days.
The company added it could be kept in long-term storage at standard freezer temperatures of -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) for up to six months.
Pfizer’s vaccine, on the other hand, needs to be stored in deep-freezer conditions of -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) which could complicate supply chain logistics, particularly in less developed countries.
On the downside, Moderna’s vaccine has about three times more genetic material per dose than its Pfizer counterpart, Zoltan Kis, a research associate at Imperial College’s Future Vaccine Manufacturing Hub, said.This would raise production costs and make it harder to scale-up.
– Questions remain –
The promising results of both vaccines are seen as a validation for mRNA technology, which has never before been brought to regulatory approval.
It works by providing human cells with the genetic instructions to make a surface protein of the coronavirus, which trains the immune system to recognize the real virus.
Making a traditional vaccine is a longer process that normally involves developing a weakened form of a pathogen.It is not yet clear how long lasting the protection will be from either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, nor how well they work for the elderly, the age-group at highest risk from Covid-19.
Another open question is whether they stop people who are exposed to the virus from transmitting it on to the other people, even though they may be themselves protected from the disease. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON (AFP) – The United States could be the first country to launch one of the most ambitious vaccine operations in history: distributing and administering up to 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine in just a few months.
Massive vaccine campaigns are nothing new — they have been carried out for decades in the fight against the measles and flu, for example.
But stamping out the coronavirus is a distinctly new challenge due to three factors: the short time frame for inoculating a huge number of people, the fact that most vaccines will require two doses, and the very low temperature at which some of the vaccines must be stored.The vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech, on track to be the first authorized for use in the United States, must be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit (-70 degrees Celsius), whereas the flu vaccine can be kept in a normal refrigerator.
Pfizer vaccines distributed in the US will come from its largest manufacturing plant located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Their ship-out will include a precise, clockwork-like dance of containers, trucks and planes.
Thermal shipping containers will each be filled with dry ice and 975 vials of the vaccine which each contain five doses, for a total of 4,875 doses.
Every day six trucks will take the doses to air carriers such as FedEx, UPS or DHL, which will deliver them across the United States in one to two days and across the globe in three, Pfizer told AFP.The company expects an average of 20 daily cargo flights worldwide.
FedEx had to obtain special permission from civil aviation authorities to transport so much dry ice, which could pose a danger to the crew should it accidentally undergo ”sublimation” and pass from a solid to a gas, the company told AFP.
Once the boxes have reached their final destination, they can be opened only briefly just two times a day.”To run a large mass vaccination clinic, it’s fine,” said Julie Swann, a pandemic response expert at North Carolina State University.
But the vaccine would not be suitable for distribution at doctors’ offices or pharmacies, which are too small, she warned.
At least in the beginning Americans will have to go to hospitals or maybe even large distribution centers set up in parking lots much like Covid test sites, she said.
The vaccines can remain in their boxes for two weeks meaning hospitals will not need a special freezer.
”We’re not recommending at this time that hospitals or clinics purchase ultra cold equipment,” said Janell Routh of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
US biotech giant Moderna is also manufacturing a vaccine, which can be stored at -4 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a normal freezer.
The US government is organizing a free distribution of this vaccine to US states and territories, with each jurisdiction to decide how to distribute the doses to hospitals, pharmacies, doctors or even universities and companies will distribute the doses, in a decentralized system much like what was used for the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009.
”The federal government does not intend, with very, very few exceptions, to touch a single dose of vaccine before it goes into the arm of Americans,” said Paul Mango, an Operation Warp Speed official, during a briefing.
The objective is to offer vaccines to the most vulnerable populations before the end of December, to healthcare workers before the end of January and all Americans by the beginning of April.
Pfizer expects to produce 50 million doses this year and 1.3 billion in 2021: The United States has already ordered 100 million total including 20-30 million for delivery before the end of December. The European Union meanwhile has ordered 200 million, Japan 120 million, Britain 30 million and Canada 20 million.
Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi and others are hoping their own vaccines will also prove safe and effective, and their global rollout will follow suit.
Carrier DHL estimates that 15 million cooling boxes would need to be delivered over the next two years, with approximately 15,000 flights needed worldwide.
Poorer countries that lack storage capacity for large quantities of vaccines that need super-cold storage have little hope of benefiting from the first doses, said Prashant Yadav, an expert in global health supply chains at the Center for Global Development.
Ultracold freezers that can reach temperatures of -112 degrees Fahrenheit cost five times more than standard freezers and are only made to order, he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The head of the World Health Organization hailed the rapid progress towards a Covid-19 vaccine but insisted Friday that every country must reap the benefits.

“A vaccine will be a vital tool for controlling the pandemic, and we’re encouraged by the preliminary results of clinical trials released this week,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, in closing the WHO’s annual assembly.
US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their candidate vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in ongoing final phase trials involving more than 40,000 people, less than a year after the novel coronavirus emerged in China.“Never in history has vaccine research progressed so quickly. We must apply the same urgency and innovation to ensuring that all countries benefit from this scientific achievement,” said Tedros.
The coronavirus has killed nearly 1.3 million people worldwide while more than 52.7 million cases have been registered, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.
However, the tallies probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases.
– Shared pathogens lab plan –
Tedros said the pandemic had shown there was an urgent need for “a globally-agreed system for sharing pathogen materials and clinical samples”, to facilitate the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics as “global public goods”.He said the system could not wait for bilateral agreements that could take years to negotiate.
“We are proposing a new approach that would include a repository for materials housed by WHO in a secure Swiss facility; an agreement that sharing materials into this repository is voluntary; that WHO can facilitate the transfer and use of the materials; and a set of criteria under which WHO would distribute them,” said Tedros.
The UN health agency’s director-general thanked Thailand and Italy for offering to provide materials and pioneer the new approach, and Switzerland for offering a laboratory.WHO member states on Friday approved a resolution on strengthening preparedness for health emergencies.
The resolution calls on countries “to prioritise at the highest political level the improvement of, and coordination for, health emergency preparedness.”
It also urges countries to continue developing their capacities for detecting infectious diseases, in compliance with the International Health Regulations.
– Sounding the alarm –
The regulations on global health security, approved in 2005 and entering into force two years later, notably regulate how a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) is declared.
They also include specific measures to be implemented at ports, airports and border posts in order to limit the spread of risk.
Several voices were raised questioning the effectiveness of this process in attempting to prevent or rein in the Covid-19 pandemic.
Washington accused Tedros of being too slow to declare a PHEIC over the new coronavirus. The WHO chief himself has been critical of its binary on-or-off nature, with no levels of alert in between.
The resolution adopted on Friday asks Tedros to seek possible “complementary mechanisms” that could be used to alert member states “about the severity and/or magnitude of a public health emergency in order to mobilise necessary support and to facilitate international coordination”.
He is expected to deliver his ideas at the next WHO annual meeting.
Besides discussing the pandemic, the WHO assembly agreed on a new plan to defeat meningitis by 2030; increased action on epilepsy and other neurological disorders; and a strategy to speed up the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines play an “outsized role” on social media, driven in part by a lack of reliable information which could threaten their efficacy, an NGO specializing in misinformation warned Thursday.

“When people can’t easily access reliable information around vaccines and when mistrust in actors and institutions related to vaccines is high, misinformation narratives rush in to fill the vacuum,” First Draft said in a report.
“We have reached a pivotal and hypersensitive crossroads where increasing rates of vaccine skepticism may not only jeopardize the effectiveness of a potential Covid-19 vaccine but that of vaccines more broadly.”The group collected millions of posts from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook that included the words “vaccine” or “vaccination” in English, Spanish and French for three months from mid-June.
Researchers then whittled those down to 1,200 of the most viral posts.
Two topics were dominant — those that referred to the “political and economic motives” behind vaccines and those that referred to their safety and necessity.
“Conspiracy theories about vaccines in general and the Covid-19 vaccine specifically play an outsized role on social media, particularly in Francophone spaces,” concluded the group, which was founded in 2015 and is considered an authority on misinformation.
Many posts linked vaccines to conspiracy theories such as the belief that a future Covid-19 shot will be used to microchip individuals and develop mass population-tracking systems.
Conspiracy theories were also fuelled by a lack of information about vaccine ingredients, for instance, or new technologies such as “messenger RNA” (mRNA) behind the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, which announced this week it was 90 percent effective.
This innovative technique is being used by other vaccine developers such as US biotech company Moderna.
“Certain posts claimed Moderna’s new potential Covid-19 vaccine will change people’s DNA, and some posts presented the mRNA vaccine as the definitive future Covid-19 vaccine or discredited any future Covid-19 vaccine altogether,” First Draft said.
“Others even linked Moderna’s vaccine and mRNA vaccines generally to targeted depopulation efforts or malign human engineering programs.”
The NGO noted that vaccine concerns brought together a wide range of different communities including libertarians, anti-vaxxers, New Age groups and QAnon adherents.
It recommended reliable news sources, social media monitoring and research organisations collaborate to identify and address any lack of data, but also avoid oversupply of information on a given topic, which “often leads to confusion and ultimately news avoidance.”
“We need to find a way to acknowledge people’s uncertainties and fears, rather than dismiss them, and build bridges between health experts and the vaccine-hesitant,” it added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Final phase 3 trials of the plant-derived vaccine candidate will begin by year’s end and will be tested on 30,000 volunteers in North America, Latin America and Europe, according to a joint statement.
Phase 2 trials will be conducted in multiple locations across Canada and, upon government approval, in the United States.
A global scramble has been underway to develop and test vaccines against the coronavirus, which has sickened tens of millons of people worldwide and deeply wounded the global economy.
On Tuesday, Medicago reported that its vaccine candidate resulted in “100 percent” protection in 180 healthy people who participated in its phase 1 clinical trials.
The company’s executive vice president of scientific and medical affairs Nathalie Landry said those results were “very encouraging and fully support further clinical evaluation.”
GSK’s chief medical officer Thomas Breuer said GSK was “confident (about) delivering an efficacious vaccine with an acceptable safety profile in collaboration with Medicago.”
“This is the first of several GSK Covid-19 vaccine candidate collaborations to start Phase 2/3 clinical testing and an important step forward in our contribution to the global fight against the pandemic,” he said.
The studies will look to confirm that the formulation along with dosing — given 21 days apart — is safe and triggers the body’s immune response in healthy adults aged 18-64 years and in elderly subjects aged 65 and over.
The Canadian government in October pledged up to Can$173 million (US$132 million) to help develop the vaccine, and placed a tentative order for 76 million doses. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement as Duterte virtually participated in the 37th ASEAN Summit and Related Summits hosted by Vietnam Thursday.
In a statement, Roque said that the President welcomed China’s promise to make ASEAN countries to be among the first to receive the vaccine.“The President said ASEAN encourages close cooperation, collaboration with China in the development and equitable distribution of safe, effective, affordable vaccines, diagnostics, and medicines,” he said.
“[He] welcomed China’s pledge to make the COVID-19 vaccine a global public good which China has promised ASEAN to be the first, will be among the first to benefit,” he added.
According to Roque, Duterte, who serves as ASEAN’s country coordinator for China, expressed the regional bloc’s appreciation to the latter’s willingness to assist in the response to the pandemic.
“The President expressed ASEAN’s appreciation to China for its pledge to contribute to the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund, another cooperation, initiatives for Public Health Emergencies and its support to ASEAN’s Regional Reserve of Medical Supplies and provisions for assistance to ASEAN member-states,” he said.
“PRRD added that ASEAN looks forward to China for support and for a Comprehensive Recovery Framework and its implementation plan to allow for ASEAN’s robust recovery, resiliency, and sustainability,” he added.
Duterte likewise reaffirmed ASEAN’s commitment to the full and effective implementation of the 2002 Declaration of the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in its entirety.
According to Roque, the President likewise reiterated that ASEAN will work towards the conclusion and adoption and effective substantive Code of Conduct in the South China Sea consistent with international law including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
The Palace official said that the ASEAN welcomed the designation of 2021 as the ASEAN-China Year of Sustainable Development Cooperation, where ASEAN encourages cooperation with China in areas such as poverty eradication, food security, environment protection, and climate change.

“We must work together to ensure that all nations – rich or poor – will have access to safe vaccines. No one is safe until all of us are safe,” the President said during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plenary session.Duterte made the appeal following reports of imminent breakthrough in vaccine development to protect people from the deadly virus.United States-based Pfizer recently announced that its potential vaccine has shown 90 percent efficacy based on clinical trials.
Addressing fellow ASEAN leaders, the President called on the Southeast Asian bloc to further enhance healthcare systems and “build back better” from the adverse impact of the pandemic.
He noted that the pandemic has become the “defining challenge of our generation” as governments moved to balance efforts in saving lives and keeping economies afloat.
“We are now confronted with the complexity and enormity of the recovery process. We aim for a comprehensive recovery to build back better, healthier, and more prosperous societies,” he said.“The path we must take is clear – it is that of deeper engagement on vital issues that bind us together as one ASEAN Community,” he added.
He said health security must be the immediate priority of the regional bloc.“We have to strengthen our health systems by ensuring the unimpeded supply of medical supplies and technologies, and by enhancing early warning systems for health emergencies,” he said.
He also called for the swift implementation of the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund, the ASEAN Regional Reserve of Medical Supplies, and the ASEAN Center for Public Health Emergencies and Emerging Diseases.At present, Indonesia has the most number of coronavirus infections in the region with more than 448,000.

WASHINGTON, United States — The United States on Tuesday registered a record 200,000 new COVID-19 cases in one day, highlighting the desperate need for a vaccine after results from one medical trial fuelled optimism around the world.

The vaccine news brought some relief from an otherwise grim picture, with tighter restrictions imposed in Europe and the Middle East, and a surge in the US claiming 1,535 lives in 24 hours.
Stocks in some industries hit hardest by travel curbs, social distancing and lockdowns rebounded on hopes that the world may return to normal, after pharma giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their vaccine candidate was 90 percent effective.A vaccine is seen as the best chance to break the cycle of deadly virus surges and severe restrictions across much of the world since COVID-19 first emerged in China late last year and ballooned into a pandemic.
Pfizer and BioNTech said they could supply up to 50 million doses of the vaccine globally this year and up to 1.3 billion next year if it receives approval.
The scientific community reacted positively overall — although the trial is still ongoing and the vaccine candidate would need to be stored in specialist deep freezers, creating huge supply chain complications.
The vaccine candidate is one of more than 40, but no other developer has yet made similar claims about effectiveness.There was also promising news from Brussels, where the EU parliament and member states struck a deal to pass the bloc’s multi-annual budget, unblocking 750 billion euros ($886 billion) in coronavirus recovery funds.
Dacian Ciolos, head of the parliament’s centrist Renew Europe Group, called the agreement “a game-changer” for Europeans facing adversity from the pandemic.
‘A very dark winter’
The novel coronavirus has infected close to 51 million people worldwide, with more than 1.2 million deaths.On Tuesday, 6,867 new deaths were recorded worldwide, with the highest daily tolls in France, Spain and the United States.
The US remains the hardest hit nation at more than 10 million cases and nearly 240,000 deaths, with shocking new data now including a record 60,000 current hospitalizations.
The pandemic was one of the top issues for voters in last week’s presidential election.
Joe Biden, who had slammed President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis, spared no time in announcing a COVID-19 taskforce on Monday after being declared president-elect.
“We’re still facing a very dark winter,” Biden said.Trump had clashed repeatedly with his own government experts, often refusing to back restrictions or even wear a mask in public.
After the Pfizer announcement, he claimed — without evidence — that the news was delayed until after the election to damage him.
There was a separate breakthrough when the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted emergency approval to a synthetic antibody treatment developed by the pharma company Eli Lilly.
Bamlanivimab, which was shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and emergency room visits, is the first major drug to be approved that was designed specifically for the coronavirus.
‘Stage of critical danger’
Despite encouraging news on the medical front, rising infection and death rates have left many governments struggling to cope.
Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro — who has downplayed the virus even as it has killed 163,000 people in his country — lashed out with a homophobic rant.
“I regret the deaths. I really do. But we’re all going to die someday. There’s no use fleeing reality. We have to stop being a country of fags,” he said in a speech.
“We have to face up to it and fight. I hate this faggot stuff.”
In Italy, virus restrictions were increased in five of the country’s 20 regions on Tuesday.
Hungary, one of the hardest-hit countries in terms of deaths in proportion to the population, has also announced new measures to come into force on Wednesday.
Elsewhere on the continent, Albania imposed a night-time curfew and Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid went into self-isolation after coming into contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.
In Greece, the government stopped supermarkets from selling “non-essential goods” in order to avoid unfair competition against smaller shops that have been forced to close, following a similar move in France.
In the Middle East, Lebanon on Tuesday announced a fresh two-week lockdown despite a grinding economic crisis that has already battered businesses.
“We’ve reached a stage of critical danger as private and public hospitals don’t have the capacity to receive severe cases,” the country’s caretaker prime minister, Hassan Diab, said in a televised address.
The region also mourned the death from coronavirus complications of veteran Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat — a long-time architect of plans to end the conflict with Israel through the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas called the passing of “a brother and friend… a great loss for Palestine and our people.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Offering a glimpse of hope amid the pandemic, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the designated vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19, expressed optimism Wednesday on the discovery and availability of a possible cure against the viral disease that has taken the world by surprise.

However, Galvez said that while the potential vaccine is just around the corner, Filipinos should still observe the minimum health standards to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
“Sa ngayon nakita natin malaki ang prospects natin na talagang magkakaroon na tayo ng vaccine pero sinasabi natin na habang wala pa ang vaccine ay patuloy pa rin natin na (sundin) ang minimum health standard, social distancing at pagwear ng mask, at pag-iwas sa matataong lugar (Right now, we have very high prospects that we will really have a vaccine but while it isn’t here yet, we should still [follow] the minum health standard, [observe] social distancing, wearing of mask, and avoiding crowded areas),” he said in a virtual media forum.Recently, Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical giant, announced that the vaccine that it is currently developing in partnership with BioNTech, a German biotechnology company, yielded more than 90 percent efficiency in preventing COVID-19 among its volunteers.
But Galvez said that the government is currently prioritizing the candidate vaccines being offered in the Covax Facility, where a solidarity trial participated in by hundreds of countries and initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO) is currently happening.
“Sa Covax mayroon na po tayong tinatawag na 20 percent guaranteed access. Meaning, more or less 25 to 20 million Filipinos can access equitably doon sa Covax,” he said.
Galvez noted that bilateral and multilateral engagements with other countries are being done so that the Philippines’ access to the Covax Facility can be increased to enable the inoculation of 25 to 30 million Filipinos.Earlier, Galvez said that the “best case scenario” for the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines is that it could take place in the second quarter of 2021.
Priority
Meanwhile, Galvez turned to the directive of President Duterte back in September to prioritize the vaccines being developed by China and Russia.Department of Health spokesperson Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire has said that the country is already in “advanced talks” with China and Russia to secure a supply of the vaccines that they are developing, which are Sinovac and Gamaleya respectively.The vaccine czar met with the ambassador of China on Wednesday to discuss the development of its clinical trials in the Philippines for the Sinovac vaccine.
“We are very thankful that they have committed na bibigyan tayo ng access. The prime minister of China has given an order that the Philippines will be given a priority access and they will even donate some of the vaccines for us,” he said.
China is currently on the Phase 3 clinical trials of its candidate vaccine, Sinovac.But its development took a snag when a “serious adverse event” led to the stoppage of its clinical trials in Brazil, foreign news reports said Wednesday. No other information was immediately provided as to what kind of event took place.
“Sa issue ng Brazil, tignan muna natin ang evdence na lumabas. Minsan ‘yung mga balita na lumalabas mga kontrobersyal, minsan para magpeak ‘yung isang brand or maging maganda ‘yung media releases ng ibang brands. Hintayin natin ang comment ng company so our evaluation will be evidence-based,” Galvez said.Brazil’s Butantan biomedical institute, however, was quoted as saying that the serious adverse event “was not related to the vaccine trial itself,” according to a report from CNN.
Meanwhile, Gamaleya already submitted the results of their Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to the Department of Health (DOH).
The government is now awaiting for Gamaleya’s contract research organization (CRO) which will serve as their partner team in the Philippines before they can conduct their Phase 3 clinical trial, or the vaccination of a large number of people who are conisdered as test subjects, here in the country.
With the government’s target of getting vaccine shots for 75 to 80 million Filipinos, Galvez said the COVID-19 vaccination program may last up to three to five years.
“Realistically, you can only vaccinate so much. Ang target natin is 75 to 80 million of our population, then we will do this in three to five years time. Iyon po ang reality,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

President Duterte said that the respiratory disease is not as frightening because of the encouraging developments in the candidate vaccines of China and the United States.
American drug-maker Pfizer and its partner BionNtech recently announced that the COVID-19 vaccine that they are jointly developing was 90 percent effective in preventing the disease as shown in the early results of the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.“Napaka-encouraging po itong lumabas na artikulo about Pfizer. But of course,we have to temper our expectations. Kailangan grounded pa rin tayo doon sa realidad natin na nandyan pa rin ‘yung virus at kailangan ginagawa pa rin natin yung mga preventive measures (This article about Pfizer is very encouraging. But of course, we have to temper our expectations. We still need to be grounded in the reality that we still have the virus and we still need to take preventive measures),” said Vergeire in an online forum.
“Hindi tayo kailangan matakot, kung ginagawa po natin ang minimum health standards natin at saka sumusunod sa mga health protocols. Lalo na, lumalakas ang loob natin lahat dahil alam natin padating na ang mga bakuna at mukhang maganda ang indikasyon na pinapakita doon sa mga trials na isinasagawa (We don’t need to be afraid if we are following our minimum health standards and health protocols. More so, we are all encouraged because it looks like there are good indications in the vaccine trials that are being conducted),” she added.
It is still too early to conclude if the candidate vaccine of Pfizer and BioNtech is effective against COVID-19, although it is considered as “exciting news,” said Dr. Anna Lisa Ong-Lim, a pediatric infectious specialist and a member of the DoH Technical Advisory group.
“Siguro one thing we have to understand, unang-una ito ay press release galing ng kumpanya. Ang talagang basehan natin para suriin ng maigi ang resulta ng isang trial (First, it is a press release from the company. Our real basis for carefully examining the results of a trial) is usually the scientific journal report,” said Lim.“’Yung inirelease po ng kumpanya is what they would call their interim data analysis. So parang very early results…para lang tayo mabigyan ng indication kung saan na patungo ‘yung trial reports (What the company had released is what they would call their interim data analysis. So, these are very early results … just to give us an indication of where the trial reports are going),” she added.
The DoH is also looking at the possibility of securing an exemption in the country’s procurement law in the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.
Republic Act 9184 or the Procurement Law only allows payments to be made after the items have been delivered to the Philippines.
“We have sought the assistance of the Office of the President para magkaroon ng mas malinaw na direksyon kung puwedeng magkaroon ng special na exemption (if we can have special exemption) from this specific provision of the law that we cannot pay until the orders are here,” said Vergeire.
“As we know, many of the manufacturers, partners, we are negotiating with…they are requiring this advance payment. So pinag-uusapan yan ngayon at ginagawan ng pag-aaral kung maaari magkaroon ng (we are discussing about that now and we are studying if we can have a) special exemption because of this pandemic,” she added.

Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto on Wednesday urged the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) to waive its service fee in buying the vaccines for COVID-19.
Senate Ralph Recto (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
“This is not the time to reap a pandemic windfall. When private corporations are waiving fees and writing off interests, a state agency should avoid being accused of disaster profiteering,” Recto said in a statement.
The PITC had been tasked by President Duterte to purchase COVID-19 vaccines from abroad. Under proposed 2021 national budget, lawmakers set aside P8 billion for vaccine purchase, and another P10 billion in unprogrammed funds to be made available if government resources already available.According to Recto, the Department of Trade and Industry-attached agency charges a commission of four percent for projects with a total contract price (TCP) of P25 million and below; and one percent for projects with a TCP of P700 million and above.
Recto said that if such charges are waived, “our cash-strapped, debt-assisted government will be able to save money which can be used to save lives and livelihood.”
“Saan aabot, halimbawa, ang P100 million na service fee? Libo-libong PPE para sa ospital, milyon-milyong modules para sa mga paaralan (What could, for instance, a P100-million service fee afford? It could be used to buy thousands of personal protective equipment for hospitals, or millions of modules for our schools),” he pointed out.
“The expectation that a government-to-government transaction will save money won’t happen if the government agency on the Philippine side will be entitled to an add-on,” he added.“If citizens and corporations alike are volunteering their services, equipment and facilities for free, a government corporation should do no less, and has no choice but to follow the bayanihan example,” he continued.
Recto believed that the PITC and secretaries of concerned agencies will agree to his proposal, saying “they are good people.”
The Senate leader said such a “no-commission” rule could also be included as a special provision in the 2021 budget bill, “which I am sure will pass muster in the Senate, concurred by the House, and risks no veto from the President.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Many Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs) are not likely to resume business unless a vaccine for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) becomes available and the tax rates are reduced, Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) officials disclosed.
(MANILA BULLETIN)
They said only about 15 POGOs are still operating from the previous total of 63 due to low revenues.
The workforce was also cut by about 70 percent to comply with the government’s pandemic protocol.BIR sources said many Chinese workers were not allowed to return to the Philippines after celebrating their new year in China in February due to the health crisis.
The growth of the industry is dampened by the recent BIRregulations revisingthe tax rates, described by POGO lawyers as “unreasonable.” Revenue Regulations 30-2020 required online gaming operators to remit to the BIR five percent of the gross bets as franchise tax, or the minimum guarantee fee, whichever is higher.
The regulations also prescribed the remittance of two percent of the gross winnings to the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation as license fee.In addition, they are alsomandated to withhold and remit to the BIR 15 percent of the salaries of their foreign workers as income tax.
POGOs are also subject to pay income and value-added taxes onnon-gaming activities like sale of goods and services.
The regulations stated that income from this source will be exclusively used to contain the virus. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Pfizer, the New York-based pharmaceutical company announced Monday that its drug has shown 90 percent effectiveness in protecting people against the deadly virus. The drug being developed jointly with German firm BioNTech, is one of more than 40 candidate vaccines.
The companies said they could pass the final hurdles for a US rolloutlater this month, and could supply up to 50 milliondoses globally this year and up to 1.3 billion next year.
However, safety data still needs to be verified before it gets authorization.“Muli nating ipinaalam sa kanila ang kahandaan ng Pamahalaang Panglunsod ng Maynila na bumili ng inisyal na P250 milyon (additional P50M) na halaga ng bakuna mula sa kanila para sa mga taga Maynila (We reiterated the readiness of the city to buy an initial P250-million worth of vaccines from them for Manileños),” he said in a Facebook post.“Kapit lang.

In July, Mayor Isko ordered the city government to earmark P200 million from its 2021 budget for the purchase of free COVID-19 vaccines for city residents.
Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manual Romualdez said Pfizer is ready to supply their vaccines to the country by early next year and after it gets regulatory approval from United States and Philippine authorities.

The United States could be the first country to launch one of the most ambitious vaccine operations in history: distributing and administering up to 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine in just a few months.
Filling and packaging tests for the large-scale production and supply of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate are pictured in September 2020 in Anagni Italy
Massive vaccine campaigns are nothing new — they have been carried out for decades in the fight against the measles and flu, for example.But stamping out the coronavirus is a distinctly new challenge due to three factors: the short time frame for inoculating a huge number of people, the fact that most vaccines will require two doses, and the very low temperature at which some of the vaccines must be stored.The vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech, on track to be the first authorized for use in the United States, must be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit (-70 degrees Celsius), whereas the flu vaccine can be kept in a normal refrigerator.
Pfizer vaccines distributed in the US will come from its largest manufacturing plant located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Their ship-out will include a precise, clockwork-like dance of containers, trucks and planes.
Thermal shipping containers will each be filled with dry ice and 975 vials of the vaccine which each contain five doses, for a total of 4,875 doses.
Every day six trucks will take the doses to air carriers such as FedEx, UPS or DHL, which will deliver them across the United States in one to two days and across the globe in three, Pfizer told AFP.
The company expects an average of 20 daily cargo flights worldwide.
FedEx had to obtain special permission from civil aviation authorities to transport so much dry ice, which could pose a danger to the crew should it accidentally undergo “sublimation” and pass from a solid to a gas, the company told AFP.
Once the boxes have reached their final destination, they can be opened only briefly just two times a day.“To run a large mass vaccination clinic, it’s fine,” said Julie Swann, a pandemic response expert at North Carolina State University.
But the vaccine would not be suitable for distribution at doctors’ offices or pharmacies, which are too small, she warned.
At least in the beginning Americans will have to go to hospitals or maybe even large distribution centers set up in parking lots much like Covid test sites, she said.
The vaccines can remain in their boxes for two weeks meaning hospitals will not need a special freezer.
“We’re not recommending at this time that hospitals or clinics purchase ultra cold equipment,” said Janell Routh of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
– Poor countries later –
US biotech giant Moderna is also manufacturing a vaccine, which can be stored at -4 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a normal freezer.
The US government is organizing a free distribution of this vaccine to US states and territories, with each jurisdiction to decide how to distribute the doses to hospitals, pharmacies, doctors or even universities and companies will distribute the doses, in a decentralized system much like what was used for the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009.
“The federal government does not intend, with very, very few exceptions, to touch a single dose of vaccine before it goes into the arm of Americans,” said Paul Mango, an Operation Warp Speed official, during a briefing.
The objective is to offer vaccines to the most vulnerable populations before the end of December, to healthcare workers before the end of January and all Americans by the beginning of April.
Pfizer expects to produce 50 million doses this year and 1.3 billion in 2021: The United States has already ordered 100 million total including 20-30 million for delivery before the end of December. The European Union meanwhile has ordered 200 million, Japan 120 million, Britain 30 million and Canada 20 million.
Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi and others are hoping their own vaccines will also prove safe and effective, and their global rollout will follow suit.
Carrier DHL estimates that 15 million cooling boxes would need to be delivered over the next two years, with approximately 15,000 flights needed worldwide.
Poorer countries that lack storage capacity for large quantites of vaccines that need super-cold storage have little hope of benefiting from the first doses, said Prashant Yadav, an expert in global health supply chains at the Center for Global Development.
Ultracold freezers that can reach temperatures of -112 degrees Fahrenheit cost five times more than standard freezers and are only made to order, he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez said Pfizer might sell the vaccine at $5 per shot to the Philippines once it gets regulatory approval from both US and Philippine authorities.
Pfizer recently announced that initial late-stage clinical trials showed its vaccine is more than 90 percent effective in protecting the people from the new coronavirus. Safety data, however will still needs to be established before getting US authorization.“Right now, sila ang pinakanauuna ngayon dito sa Amerika na maa-approve dahil 90% ang efficacy ng Pfizer. Ang maganda diyan eh hindi naman ibibenta sa mga bayan kagaya natin na mahal dahil alam nila na tayo ay simple country, moderate (Right now, they will be the first in America that will be approved because Pfizer has 90 percent efficacy. The good thing is it will not sold at a high price to countries like ours because they know we are a simple, moderate country),” Romualdez said in a pre-recorded statement aired during Palace press briefing Tuesday.
“So, it will be sold to many of their allies specifically in the Philippines na hindi naman gaano kamahal. It will probably be around $5 siguro per shot at maganda na iyon (So it will be sold to many of their allies specifically in the Philippines at a reasonable rate. It will probably be around $5 per shot. That’s good),” he said.
Romualdez said if vaccine production starts this year, Pfizer would have to prioritize vaccine supply to the United States, which reportedly needs 100 million doses. “Pero (But) they are intending to produce as many as one billion by middle of next year,” he said.
Romualdez admitted that Pfizer was the first US drug manufacturer that reached out to the Philippine authorities about its potential vaccine supply. He added that he has close communication with the Pfizer’s country manager in the Philippines.“Sila ang nagfo-follow-up diyan sa FDA natin na kapag once na na-approved tayo ng FDA natin diyan, they are prepared to already plan the supply for us (They have ben following up with our FDA that once the FDA approves the vaccine, they are prepared to already plan the supply for us),” he said.
If Pfizer gets approval from the United States and Philippine Food and Drug Authority, he said vaccines could be made available by the first quarter of 2021.He said the company has not asked for any downpayment but a “purchase order” in case the government is interested in the vaccine acquisition.
“Sa tingin ko by early next year, the first quarter magkakaroon na tayo ng by tranches iyan (I think by early next year, the first quarter, we may have supply by tranches),” he said.

Drilon estimated that the funds to be allocated for the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) can roughly cover the amount the government needs to procure the medicines.
“(Carlito) Galvez (Jr.) said government intends to buy an initial 50 million doses of vaccines for 25 million Filipinos. That means two doses per person. At US$5 dose or US $10 for two doses, that’s US $250-million or P12.5-billion needed to immunize 25 million Filipinos,” Drilon said in a statement.
“The anti-insurgency fund for 2021 is P19-B. We do not have to borrow,” the minority leader said.
Galvez, COVID-19 national task force chief, earlier said that the government is considering borrowing up to $9-billion from World Bank to help fund the government’s procurement of a COVID-19 vaccine which will primarily be administered to health workers.
Detained Senator Leila de Lima echoed Drilon’s point, saying the anti-insurgency fund should be used to save Filipinos from the pandemic.
“Ang dapat pinopondohan ngayon ay mga programa na sasaklolo sa mahihirap na lalo pang itinulak ng pandemya at kalamidad at kahirapan (the government ought to be funding programs that will save our people from the pandemic, calamities and poverty),” De Lima said in a separate statement.
“Because this anti-insurgency program is obviously not aimed to end insurgency the way NTF-ELCAC conducts it, with their hysterical dissemination of fake news and red-tagging blitz of known personalities and individuals only seeking government accountability,” she said.
“These hefty funds should better be spent on calamity response and on a more responsive poverty alleviation program to eliminate, or diminish, the root causes of social injustice that radicalizes some of our countrymen,” added the senator.
Sen. Risa Hontiveros also said she supports moves to realigning the NTF-ELCAC budget to health care, considering that the proposed budget of the Department of Health (DOH) for 2021 is underfunded.
“I stand with our Senate Minority Leader Senator Frank, we should really look into allocating the ELCAC budget of P19-billion to the more urgently needed (programs),” Hontiveros said in an interview on ANC Headstart.
“Hindi pinaka-urgent ngayon ang counterinsurgency kundi I’m proposing to move half of that or P8-billion to our underfunded DOH budget, and some P2-billion for our government and regional hospitals and other needs in the current health and economic crisis,” she further said.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Brazil’s health regulator said Monday it had suspended clinical trials of a Chinese-developed Covid-19 vaccine after an “adverse incident” involving a volunteer recipient, a blow for one of the most advanced vaccine candidates.

The setback for CoronaVac, developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech, came on the same day US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said its own vaccine candidate had shown 90 percent effectiveness, sending global markets soaring and raising hopes of an end to the pandemic.
The Brazilian regulator, Anvisa, said in a statement it had “ruled to interrupt the clinical study of the CoronaVac vaccine after a serious adverse incident” on October 29.It said it could not give details on what happened because of privacy regulations, but that such incidents included death, potentially fatal side effects, serious disability, hospitalization, birth defects and other “clinically significant events.”
However, the public health center coordinating the trials of the vaccine in Brazil, the Butantan Institute, said it was “surprised” by the decision.
The institute “is investigating in detail what happened,” and “is at the Brazilian regulatory agency’s disposal to provide any clarification necessary on any adverse incident the clinical trials may have presented,” it said.It said it would hold a press conference on Tuesday at 11:00 am (1400 GMT).CoronaVac has been caught up in a messy political battle in Brazil, where its most visible backer has been Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, a top opponent of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.
The Sao Paulo state government said in a statement it “regrets that it learned of the decision from the press, instead of directly from Anvisa,” and was waiting along with the Butantan Institute for more information on “the real reasons for the suspension.”
– Pandemic politics –
Bolsonaro has labeled CoronaVac the vaccine from “that other country,” and pushed instead for a rival vaccine developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.
Last month, he shot down a plan by his own health minister to buy 46 million doses of CoronaVac, saying, “The Brazilian people will not be anyone’s guinea pig,” and referring to it as “Joao Doria’s Chinese vaccine.”
Doria announced earlier Monday that the first 120,000 doses of CoronaVac would arrive in Sao Paulo on November 20.
His state has a deal with Sinovac to buy a total of 46 million doses — six million produced in China and the rest produced in Sao Paulo, which broke ground last week on a factory to make the vaccine domestically.
“Officials in the state government fear Bolsonaro will use technical decisions to delay the timeline of the vaccine for political reasons,” newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported, citing unnamed Doria allies.
Anvisa told AFP it had no comment beyond its statement announcing the suspension, which said that halting trials was standard procedure in such cases.
Bolsonaro faces criticism for his handling of the pandemic, which has included downplaying the virus, opposing lockdown measures and relentlessly promoting the drug hydroxychloroquine despite studies showing it is ineffective against Covid-19.
The Sinovac, Pfizer and Oxford vaccines are all in Phase 3 trials, the final stage of testing before regulatory approval.
All are being tested in Brazil, the country with the second-highest death toll in the pandemic after the United States, with more than 162,000 people killed by the new coronavirus. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The World Health Organization chief hailed as “encouraging” Pfizer and BioNTech’s announcement Monday that their vaccine has in trials proved 90-percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infections.
The two pharmaceutical companies said the vaccine they have jointly developed had during Phase 3 trials provided protection to nearly all patients seven days after the second of two vaccine doses.
“We welcome the encouraging vaccine news from @pfizer & @BioNTech_Group & salute all scientists & partners around the who are developing new safe, efficacious tools to beat #COVID19,” WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet.“The world is experiencing unprecedented scientific innovation & collaboration to end the pandemic,” he said.
As of mid-October, the WHO has identified 42 “candidate vaccines” at the stage of clinical trials, up from 11 in mid-June.Ten of them were at the most advanced phase 3 stage, in which a vaccine’s effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally tens of thousands of people across several continents.
WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said in a tweet Monday that the news from Pfizer and BioNTech should “encourage all developers of #COVID19 vaccines to continue with clinical trials.”“The world needs several safe, effective & affordable vaccines to end this pandemic,” she said.

WASHINGTON, United States – One of the teams racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine announced Monday its drug had shown 90 percent effectiveness, sending markets soaring and raising hopes of an end to the worst pandemic in a century.
(AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)
US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said tests involving more than 40,000 people had provided results that were a ”critical milestone” in the search for a vaccine, as global infections soared past 50 million — including an alarming 10 million now in the United States alone.
Stock markets had already jumped after Democrat Joe Biden was called as the winner of the US presidential election on the weekend.They accelerated rapidly on the vaccine news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up three percent at Monday’s close of trade.
An effective vaccine is seen as the best hope to break the cycle of deadly virus surges followed by severe restrictions across much of the world since COVID-19 first emerged in China late last year.
Tens of millions of people in Europe are living under lockdowns preventing them from leaving their homes, and millions of business owners are enduring forced closures.
‘Much-needed breakthrough’
Curbs on daily life have shredded the global economy but politicians have had few other tools to protect vulnerable populations.
”We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla said in a statement.
The drug, being developed jointly with German firm BioNTech, is one of more than 40 candidate vaccines, but no other has yet made similar claims about its effectiveness.
The companies said they could pass the final hurdles for a US rollout later this month, and could supply up to 50 million doses globally this year and up to 1.3 billion next year.The scientific community reacted positively, with top US expert Anthony Fauci describing the results as ”extraordinary.”
World Health Organization director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed the news as ”encouraging” shortly after warning that the world ”might be tired of Covid-19. But it is not tired of us.”
But others pointed out that no information had yet been disclosed about the ages of the participants in the trial.
”If a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,” said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Edinburgh.
Pfizer breakthrough
A scientist who invented a technique that paved the way for Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine hailed the interim results announced by the companies Monday as “fantastic” and said the pioneering approach had a bright future.
Drew Weissman, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told AFP: “I can’t remember the last respiratory virus vaccine that has over 90 percent efficacy,” referring to the rate at which the companies said their injection protected people against the disease.
This is significantly higher than the 60-70 percent efficacy that had been mooted as possible by public health officials, and also much better than the 50 percent most influenza vaccines achieve — though the scientific community eagerly awaits the more detailed results.
Both the Pfizer vaccine and one being developed by Moderna together with the US National Institutes of Health use molecules called “messenger RNA” — an approach that has never before been brought to approval.
The idea was first demonstrated in 1990, but it wasn’t until the mid2000s that Weissman and colleague Katalin Kariko developed a technique to control a dangerous inflammatory response seen in animals exposed to these molecules, opening the way to develop safe human vaccines.
Kariko is now a senior vice president at BioNTech, where Weissman serves as an advisor.
Making the body a vaccine factory
Vaccines work by training the body to recognize certain proteins, called “antigens,” that are made by disease-causing viruses or bacteria — priming the immune system to mount a response.
Traditional vaccines, like those for measles or the flu, do this by either injecting people with small amounts of the virus, or by giving them weaker “attenuated” forms of the virus.
“Those take a lot of time to develop and to optimize,” said Weissman.
By contrast, this newer type of vaccine delivers the genetic instructions to build the antigens directly into cells, so that the human body itself is effectively turned into a vaccine making factory.
The Covid-19 vaccines based on mRNA make human cells grow an antigen of SARS-CoV-2, known as the “spike protein,” on their surface.
Biden task force
Outgoing US President Donald Trump was among the first to react, writing on Twitter: ”STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS!”
He later claimed on Twitter that news of progress on a vaccine had been delayed until after the election to damage him.
The US Food and Drug Administration also reached a breakthrough Monday, granting emergency approval to a synthetic antibody treatment against COVID-19 developed by Eli Lilly. Bamlanivimab, which was shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and emergency room visits, is the first major drug to be approved that was designed specifically against the new coronavirus.
American voters handed victory to Biden in part because Trump failed to rein in the epidemic — often refusing to back restrictive measures or even wear a mask in public and repeatedly undermining his own experts.
Biden, who will not take office until January, has already announced a taskforce to tackle Covid-19, as confirmed infections soared past 10 million and American deaths neared 238,000.
”We’re still facing a very dark winter,” he said.
”The bottom line: I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around once we’re sworn in.”
‘Out of control’
The vaccine news will be of particular relief to people in Europe — the current focal point of the pandemic and the region subject to the most widespread restrictions.
The European Union said Monday it could soon sign a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech for 300 million doses of the new coronavirus vaccine.
”European science works!” declared Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, congratulating the companies after they claimed a breakthrough.
On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky became the latest leader to test positive for the virus, with his office saying he felt well and would self-isolate and continue to work.
Italy was edging closer to a full lockdown, with experts warning of pressure on hospitals.
”There is no doubt that the situation is largely out of control,” said Massimo Galli, head of the infectious diseases department at Milan’s Sacco hospital.
Grim news kept coming elsewhere, with Russia surpassing its record for daily infections again Monday.
Hungary is now one of the hardest-hit countries in terms of deaths proportionate to its population, and the government announced new national restrictions to come into force Wednesday.
Portugal meanwhile entered a state of emergency that will see curfews imposed on most of the population.
In France, which has imposed nationwide stay-at-home orders and is clocking more than 40,000 cases a day, the central bank revised its expectations of the damage wrought by the curbs.
”Before the second wave, we thought the recession would be a little less than nine percent, we think today that for 2020 as a whole it will be between nine and 10 percent,” Banque de France chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau said.
Meanwhile, vaccine development took a hit Monday when Brazil’s health regulator announced it had suspended clinical trials of a Chinese-developed COVID-19 vaccine — one of the most advanced vaccine candidates — after an ”adverse incident” involving a volunteer recipient. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

State-owned trading arm Philippine International Trading Corp. (PTC) has been tapped to procure the COVID-19 vaccines as early as before the end of this year as the government pursues negotiations with foreign manufacturers.
Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon M. Lopez
Trade and Industry Secretary RamonM. Lopez said during the Malacanang Laging Handa press briefing that Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the Philippines’ Declared National Policy Against COVID-19, informed him Sunday night (Nov. 8, 2020) of the possibility to start the first batch of vaccines before the end of the year.This means, Lopez said, that government agencies are continuously looking at the selection and procurement of the vaccines. The Department of Budget and Management and PITC are involved in this effort. He said the PITC, where he is chairperson, has been tapped to execute the purchase of the vaccines.He said Science and Technology Secretary Fortunato Dela Pena and Galvez are talking to different companies through bilateral arrangements. He also cited lots of clinical trials ad tests being conducted as part of the ongoing R&D of the manufacturing firms that include the Russian manufacturer of the Sputnik 5 Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology.
Meantime, Lopez said they were meeting this afternoon, Nov. 9, with stakeholders on the price range for COVID-19 tests. The suggested retail prices of RT PCR tests may be released within the week, he said.
The Department of Health is setting the guidelines while the DTI will work on the SRP or price range for these tests.
For the SRP on Noche Buena products, Lopez said his agency is expected to announce the brands that will not increase their prices by tomorrow (Nov. 10). He said most of the brands have committed not to raise prices except for one fruit cocktail brand that they are still trying to convince. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The statement was released as soaring coronavirus cases across the world have forced many millions of people back into lockdown, causing further damage to ravaged economies.
European stock markets and oil prices jumped on the announcement.And US President Donald Trump, who lost last week’s election in part over his administration’s response to the pandemic, hailed the announcement as “such great news”.According to preliminary findings, protection in patients was achieved seven days after the second of two doses, and 28 days after the first.
The companies said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.
“The first set of results from our Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent Covid-19,” Pfizer chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.
“We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” he said.
“We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most.”
Seeking emergency use authorisation
Across much of the globe, Covid-19 infections rates are hitting record highs, with hospital intensive care units filling up and death tolls mounting.US biotech firm Moderna, several state-run Chinese labs, and a European project led by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca are also thought to be closing in on potentially viable vaccines.Two Russian Covid-19 vaccines have been registered for use even before clinical trials were completed, but have not been widely accepted outside of Russia.
The Phase 3 clinical trial — the final stage — of the new vaccine, BNT162b2, began in late July and has enrolled 43,538 participants to date, 90 percent of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 8.
Pfizer said it is gathering two months of safety data following the final dose — a requirement of the US Food and Drug Administration — to qualify for Emergency Use Authorization, which it expects by the third week in November.“We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks,” Bourla said.
‘Watershed moment’
While the Pfizer-BioNTech trial has yet to be peer-reviewed by experts, scientists reacted positively — if cautiously to the results.
Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health, University of Southampton, called it an “excellent result for a first generation vaccine”.
Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said Pfizer’s announcement “feels to me like a watershed moment” in the pandemic.
But others pointed out that there would likely be significant logistical problems in getting the vaccine to everyone, especially given it must be kept super-cooled and currently requires two doses to bestow immunity.
Eleanor Riley, professor of Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Edinburgh, said for example that the Monday’s results did not disclose the ages of participants.
“If a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,” she said.
Dozens more candidates
The so-called messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine is a new approach to protecting against viral infection.
Unlike traditional vaccines, which work by training the body to recognise and kill proteins produced by pathogens, mRNA tricks the patient’s immune system to produce viral proteins itself.The proteins are harmless, but sufficient to provoke a robust immune response.
The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease.
Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-review publication.
As of mid-October, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 42 “candidate vaccines” at the stage of clinical trials, up from 11 in mid-June.Ten of them were at the most advanced phase 3 stage, in which a vaccine’s effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally tens of thousands of people across several continents.

If all things go according to plan, the Philippines is poised to procure 50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines — two doses each for 25 million Filipinos — by 2021, vaccine czar and National Task Force (NTF) chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. bared Monday.
(PIXABAY / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Galvez made the remark as he announced that the Philippine National Vaccine Roadmap, a seven-point immunization plan to eradicate the threat of COVID-19, has been approved by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID) led by the Department of Health (DOH). It was presented to President Duterte last Thursday.
“Sa kasalukuyan po, kami po ay nakikipag-usap sa embahada ng iba’t ibang bansa para sa G2G [government-to-government] at multilateral arrangements. Ang amin pong target ay makakuha tayo ng 50 million vaccines para sa 25 million nating kababayan this coming 2021 (Currently, we are in talks with embassies from different countries for government-to-government and multilateral arrangements. Our target is to get 50 million vaccines for 25 million countrymen [this] coming 2021),” he said in a virtual press briefing.For the “best case scenario,” Galvez said the country may be able to obtain about 10 to 15 million doses between May to July 2021 through bilateral and multilateral engagements with allied countries.
The government is also banking on its participation in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) COVAX Facility, a ground-breaking collaboration among countries that was initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccine.
Meanwhile, the remaining bulk of vaccines may be bought by the end of 2021 to early 2022 at “the worst case” scenario, with Galvez recognizing the huge global demand for the anticipated cure.
“Talagang nakita natin na mayroon tayong kakulangan sa supply dahil ang mga mayayamang country ay kinuha na ang majority ng production. (We really have a shortage of supply because the rich countries already secured majority of the production),” he said.
Securing the supply
Currently, the government is in talks with various companies who offered 17 different vaccines for scrutiny by the DOH, Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and the Vaccine Expert Panel (VEP), Galvez shared.Of these companies, six are from the United States, three from China, and one each from Russia, Germany, Japan, India, and Israel among others.
“Out of that 17 vaccines (manufacturers) na nakipag-ugnayan sa atin, 10 ang may bilateral, five ang nasa Covax Facility, and there are other countries na gustong makipag-arrange sa atin,” Galvez said.
Among these are Astra-Zeneca, a United Kingdom-based company; and American companies Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax.
“Sa lahat ng in-evaluate ng vaccine expert panel, Astra Zeneca ang may pinakamababang price with $5 per dose. Ngayon, tinitingnan natin sa negotiation ang access for 3 to 5 million [doses] pero ang inaano namin, at least 10 million doses for our frontliners,” Galvez said.
Once the vaccines are available next year, among those who will be prioritized in the nationwide immunization program are the health care workers, other frontliners, essential workers, and the poor and vulnerable communities.
Meanwhile, areas which recorded high COVID-19 cases will be prioritized in the planned nationwide immunization program.These areas will also be considered for the establishment of cold storage facilities where the vaccines will be stored.
“Sa area o zoning, titingnan natin ‘yung areas na naging epicenter ng ating pandemic so nandito ang Metro Manila kasama ang Region 4A (Calabarzon), Region 3 (Central Luzon), Cebu at Davao City kasama ang Cagayan de Oro. Ito ang magiging major hubs sa mga cold storage facilities (In our zoning, we are looking at areas which became epicenters of our pandemic so it includes Metro Manila, Region 4A, Region 3, Cebu, and Davao City including Cagayn de Oro. These will become the major hubs for our cold storage facilities),” Galvez said.
In adherence to President Duterte’s orders, Galvez said police and military camps may also be used as immunization centers.
“Magkakaroon ng vaccination sa camps, pwedeng gawing vaccination centers (There will be vaccination in [police and military] camps, we can even use them as vaccination centers,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

All Filipinos must receive the safe and effective coronavirus vaccine “without exception” under the national vaccination roadmap approved by President Duterte, Malacañang said Monday.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, however, said the country’s poor, frontliners, soldiers, cops, and other servicemen would be given priority in the vaccination program of the government.
The seven-point COVID-19 immunization program presented by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. was approved by the President during a meeting last Thursday.
The stages of the roadmap are vaccine selection; access and acquisition; procurement through bilateral, multilateral, and other financial modes; shipment and storage; distribution and deployment; nationwide vaccination; and evaluation and monitoring.
“Pumunta naman po tayo sa kung sino ang uunahing makatanggap ng bakuna. Ito po iyong prioritization of vaccine sang-ayon na rin sa ating Presidente: Unang-una, mauuna po iyong mga mahihirap at indigents. Ito po iyong nasa listahan natin ng 4Ps (Let’s go to who will be the first to receive the vaccines. Under the vaccine prioritization according to the President, the poor and indigents will be the first. Those who are included in the 4Ps),” Roque said during a televised press briefing.
“Pangalawa, ang frontliners, ang health care workers, ang mga sundalo, kapulisan at iyong mga essential services. Pangatlo, lahat ng Pilipino ay makakatanggap ng bakuna without exception (Second, the frontliners, health care workers, soldiers, policemen, and those in essential services. Third, all Filipinos will receive the vaccine without exception),” he said.
Under the roadmap, the government hopes the plans on vaccine selection as well as access and acquisition stages would be completed from November to December 2020. Roque said the safety and efficacy will be crucial considerations in the selection of the potential COVID vaccine. It will also be decided if a single or two doses will be needed.On how to gain access to the vaccine, Roque said the government has many options such as the COVAX with eight leading vaccine manufacturers, a government-to-government arrangement, and bilateral deals with the vaccine company.
At present, he said, the government’s priorities for possible bilateral deals involve China, Russia, United States, Japan, South Korea, India, Israel, Singapore, Germany, and other ASEAN countries.
Roque said there could also be a tripartite agreement between government-private sector and the private company. Other multilateral modes are possible pooled purchase by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and pooled purchase arranged by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and others.
On the vaccine deployment, Roque said the Department of Health will handle the policy, standards, and strategy development for immunization. The tasks of the Health department include the cold chain transportation and other logistics, storage, and post-surveillance and monitoring.
“The availability of the vaccine will be a game-changer, where we go from avoidance to actively minimizing the threat of the infection,” Roque said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

When asked about the President’s choice as the vaccine czar, Go expressed his support for the designation of National Task Force Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. as vaccine czar.
“Kami ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte, uunahin namin ang lahat ng mga mahihirap, lahat ng mga vulnerable sector para makabalik na tayo sa normal nating pamumuhay. Basta safe na ‘yung vaccine.

Go reiterated his position that he has full confidence in General Galvez.‘’We need somebody with knowledge in logistics, supply chain, and crisis management. Let’s support him),” he said.He stressed the need for a single chain of command to ensure the vaccine’s orderly and swift distribution to the public.As vaccine czar, the former military chief shall be primarily responsible for the purchase, negotiation, manufacture, production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available.“Hindi kailangan [ng health expert] kasi distribution, financial ang kailangan nito at well-coordinated dapat ito sa baba sa pagdidistribute nitong vaccine (A [health expert] is not needed because what we need here is somebody who is good in distribution, financial, and well-coordinated on the ground when it comes to the distribution of the vaccines),” Go said.“[Dapat] handa ang accessibility, affordability, mga storage ng vaccine at saka financial scheme kung paano babayaran ito.

“As early as now, we are preparing for the P100-million fund for the COVID-19 vaccine once it becomes available in the market next year,” said Mayor Jerry Treñas.
“Aside from the vaccines provided by the national government, we shall also secure a budget to ensure that a huge number of our Ilonggo families will be given vaccine,” added Treñas in a talk with City Hall employees Monday, November 9.To be prioritized for the future COVID-19 vaccine would be City Hall workers and barangay officials, who are considered frontline workers.
“We don’t know when the vaccine will be available next year, but as far as Iloilo City is concerned, I want to assure you that we will purchase vaccines for you and your families,” assured Treñas.
However, it remains unclear where the funding will come from. The executive branch of the city government has already submitted a proposed P2.7-billion budget for fiscal year 2021 to the Iloilo City council.
Treñas earlier pointed out that the proposed budget for next year will almost be the same as this year due to the challenges posed by COVID-19.Under Treñas, there could also be a public-private partnership (PPP) approach to the problem.

Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon has renewed his push for a bigger budget for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, saying it is critical to allocate a huge amount to be able to cover more Filipinos for the mass vaccinations once these become available.
Senator Franklin Drilon (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN)
Drilon noted that only a measly P2.4 billion has been allocated by the government for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.
The senator said he supports the policy direction laid out by newly appointed vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. who said the government intends to purchase an initial batch of 24 million coronavirus vaccines once they become available next year.“We support the intention. There is a disconnect, however, between the government’s pronounced policy and the 2021 national budget,” Drilon said.
“The National Expenditures Program for 2021 has not allocated sufficient funding for distributing and administering COVID-19 vaccines,” he said.
“Obviously, the P2.4 billion earmarked for next year to purchase COVID-19 vaccines is grossly insufficient. The DoH said so that we are short of P10 billion but I believe it is way beyond that,” he added, citing huge logistical and human resource requirements.
“That is why we will be pushing for more budget for the procurement and administration of potential coronavirus vaccines. Congress has to appropriate money to buy the vaccine and the best time to do it is now while we are deliberating on the spending outlay,” he said.Drilon also said he has qualms over the government’s readiness to administer the vaccines due to a lack of a clear distribution plan.
“Buying the vaccine is not the end-all-be-all solution. It will require substantial funding and complex logistics. Who will administer the vaccines? Should we hire additional staff? Is the current DoH (Department of Health) workforce enough to administer it to 20 million Filipinos? Where do we plan to store the vaccines?” Drilon said.
“The lack of clarity about these very critical matters will spell trouble next year,” he added.Drilon also renewed his push for the government to actively participate in bilateral and multilateral efforts to secure immediate access to vaccines. He cited the COVAX facility, a financing mechanism that helps low- and middle-income countries get access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.
“Clearly, the budget is not enough. I am dismayed at the apparent business-as-usual approach to this. It is reflected both in the budget and the apparent lack of a comprehensive coronavirus vaccine distribution plan,” he said.
Drilon vowed to take up the issue when the Senate tackles the 2021 national budget on the floor in the coming weeks.
“It is the best opportunity to debate on this issue. We must remember that public financing ensures widespread vaccination. We cannot leave it to the private sector.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement after President Duterte said that the government “does not care” about the people who could afford the vaccine.
In a presser aired via State-run PTV-4, Roque said that the government will not stop Filipinos who want to buy the vaccines themselves once it is available, noting there will probably be private companies that will distribute them locally.“Siguro nga pag lumabas na yung bakuna, meron pong mga private companies na magpapasok diyan at meron naman tayong mga Pilipinong can afford (I think when the vaccine comes out, there will be private companies who will distribute here and we also have Filipinos who can afford it),” he said.“Yung mga can afford puwede naman po silang magpabakuna. Hindi naman natin sila pipigilan (Those who can afford can already avail of the vaccine. We will not stop them),” he added.
Roque explained that it is the government’s strategy to give the vaccine for free to recipients of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), frontliners, and the military and the police.
However, he said that the UHC Law states that every Filipino must be vaccinated.
“Ang istratehiya natin talaga yung 4Ps recipients natin, yung mga frontliners, pulis at mga kasundaluhan ang mauuna, at ito po’y garantyado na babayaran ng gobyerno (Our strategy is to have 4Ps recipients, frontliners, and the police and the military to receive the vaccine first and this is guaranteed free by the government),” he said.
“Pero sang-ayon sa Universal Health Care law meron ding mandato na kinakailangan na bigyan natin ng bakuna ang lahat ng Pilipino (But based on the UHC Law, we are mandated to give every Filipino the vaccine),” he added.
President Duterte has recently named Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr. as the vaccine czar who will oversee all efforts regarding the acquisition, production, and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines.
The Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases has likewise approved the national COVID-19 vaccine roadmap and formed a new cluster to implement the immunization program.
Last month, President Duterte assured the public that he has already found the money to buy COVID-19 vaccines. According to Malacañang, an initial 20 million Filipinos will get the vaccine for free.
Roque had said that the estimated price for a vaccine is US$10 per dose. An individual should have two doses of the vaccine.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

I do not know yet how big the trials will be in the Americas and in the Philippines],” said Dela Peña in an online forum hosted by the Department of Health (DOH).“Definitely, wala pa silang ina-announce kung aling mga vaccines ang makakasama at kung anong protocol ang susundin. At wala pa ring eksaktong date sa Disyembre makakaumpisa dito [they have not yet announced which vaccines will be included and which protocol will be followed. And there is still no exact date on December yet as to when it will start],” he added.
Vaccine czar
In a related development, Dela Peña also threw his support behind Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., who was designated as the country’s vaccine czar.
“Kami ay naniniwala na makakabuti na magkaroon ng isang vaccine czar…The buck stops there, kahit na marami kaming involved eh meron isa sa itaas na talagang nakakaalam. So malaking bagay na magkaroon ng vaccine czar [We believe it would be good to have a vaccine czar … The buck stops there, even though there are a lot of us who are involved, there is a head who will lead us. So, it is a good thing to have a vaccine czar],” he said.
Galvez told DOST that it will be part of a task group in-charge of the “ technical evaluation and selection” concerning potential COVID-19 vaccines, said Dela Peña.
“In fact mamaya makikipag-pulong kami kay Secretary Galvez to really define exactly kung hanggang saan ang aming responsibility dahil maraming task group ang i-criniate which definitely include DOST, DOH, and I think DBM (Department of Budget and Management) din [In fact later we will meet with Secretary Galvez to really define exactly how far our responsibility is because many task groups have been created which definitely includes DOST, DOH, and I think DBM as well],” said the DOST chief.
On Monday, November 9, Galvez is expected to present the organizational structure of the vaccine implementation team as well as other the initial plans, said DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
“Just in a nutshell, wala po tayong binago sa mga ginagawa natin. Tulad ng sinabi ni Secretary Boy (Dela Pena) kanina.. .Secretary Galvez is here to lead us and to make things more expeditious,” said Vergeire.
“Pero yung existing processes ayun pa rin ang ginagawa natin, nagbibigay lang sya ng mga [We are still doing the existing processes, he just gives] pointers on how we can improve and how we can make it more expeditious,” she added.
Galvez was tasked by President Duterte to oversee the negotiation, manufacture, production, purchase, or distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the country. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The President said the poor beneficiaries of the government’s cash subsidy program should be the first in line for the immunization drive, noting that the rich could afford to buy their own vaccine.
Duterte made the statement after Galvez commented the coronavirus vaccination program must be “equitable to the people, rich or poor” during a meeting with officials Thursday.“Well, those who – those who can afford, wala naman tayong pakialam diyan (we don’t care about that),” the President told Galvez, also Presidential peace adviser and chief implementer of the national action plan against the coronavirus.
“But sundin lang natin ‘yung listahan sa mahihirap as listed doon sa we gave – the ones that we gave to – to them, salaries or money. Iyon ‘yon talaga rin ang mauna, in that order. Pinakamahirap muna (Let’s follow the list of poor families, the ones we give salaries or money. They should be the first. In that order. The poorest first),” he added.
Galvez presented to the President the “Philippine National Vaccine Roadmap” during the meeting with other Cabinet members at the Malago Clubhouse inside Malacañang Park. The retired military general was earlier named vaccine czar to lead the government’s acquisition and distribution of the coronavirus vaccine in the country.
“This is in compliance with your order that every Filipino should be vaccinated and it should be equitable to the people, rich or poor,” Galvez told the President.
“This is your directive that the vaccine will be our road to normalcy and we will only have a full recovery with the vaccine,” he said.
He said the vaccination roadmap would be time-based and objective-based. “We will raise some different options and decision points that the President and the IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Infectious Diseases) may decide in the near future,” he added.
President Duterte had earlier said Galvez would be the only authorized official to negotiate for the country’s’ acquisition of vaccine supply.
He wanted the vaccine purchase done through a government-to-government arrangement, saying he wanted to avoid private traders to curb corruption.
Earlier, the President committed to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine for free initially to the country’s poorest Filipinos, followed by soldiers and policemen.
Duterte said he has already secured funds for the vaccine acquisition through a government-to-government arrangement.
But he said he would look for more funds so all Filipinos could be vaccinated. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., who was recently appointed by President Duterte as the vaccine czar bared Tuesday the “Philippine National Vaccine Roadmap,” a seven-point immunization plan by the national government to eradicate the threat of COVID-19.
(Joe Raedle/Getty Images/AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)
In a Laging Handa press briefing, Galvez said the initial plan will begin from November 2020 until March 2021 when the potential vaccine is expected to be made available.
7 major stages
The immunization plan has seven major stages.These are scientific evaluation; access and acquisition (guarantee of vaccine supply); procurement process; production, shipment and storage; distribution and deployment; implementation and nationwide vaccination; and assessment, evaluation and monitoring.
Galvez said the first and second stages – the scientific evaluation, and access and acquisition of potential vaccines – should be completed already by November to December 2020.
This will be initiated once they present the roadmap to Duterte on Thursday.
Critical timeline
“This is a critical timeline. The roadmap should be [approved] by the President this week,” said Galvez, who is also the chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 and the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unit (PAPRU).
Within the last quarter of the year, Galvez said a National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 vaccination and panel of experts should be fully organized.
Among the initial members of the task force are the Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology, University of the Philippines-National Institute of Health (UP-NIH), and Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).
He said that clinical trials for the potential vaccine should also take place during this period, as well as the approval of the analysis, selection and procurement of the cure.
The completion of the bilateral and multilateral engagements and arrangements with other countries and the private sector should also be done within this period.
Stages 3 to 7
Meanwhile, Galvez said they are targeting the commencement of stages three to seven in the first quarter of 2021.
“Baka doon tayo magstart ng (Maybe that’s when we can start the) early procurement process and also the different stages including the production, shipment, and storage, early planning on distribution and deployment, and implementation [of the immunization plan],” he said.
“Ito po ang aming (This is our) initial organizational roadmap wherein it is activity-based. Meaning from Stage 1 to Stage 7, ang organization po natin ay nagbabago (our organization will change). Kung saan ang activity ngayon, doon ang concentration ng tinatawag nating mga vaccine expert of panel (sic) and this will be led by the DOH, DOST, and the role of DFA and UP-NIH are very criticial,” he noted.
6 primary considerations
Through dialogues held with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Galvez said they have identified six primary considerations on the immunization plan namely: safety of the vaccine; efficacy; sensitivity or storage; cost and supply chain requirements; access for clinical trials and regional/local production and distribution; and complexity on its implementation.
But within the given time frame, Galvez expressed confidence that they will achieve their targets hoping that a vaccine will be made available late this year or early next year.
“Based on the report of Special Task Group on COVID-19 vaccine development, the earliest trial that we can have is maybe December.
At the same time, we can have an available [vaccine], once the trials of Covax yield positive results, by March or May at the earliest. That is the prediction,” he said.
10 vaccines
There are 10 vaccine contenders in the country right now, eight of which are from COVAX, a global collaboration of countries to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccine, Galvez said.
Among the pharmaceutical companies with promising trials is the United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca, which, according to Galvez, has a capacity to produce one billion vaccines by the end of the year.
“Ito ang tinitignan natin (This is what we’re looking at). That’s why we are having an engagement with the Ambassaddor of UK so we can have some sort of diplomatic arrangement on how we can access this early the vaccines,” he said.
Diplomatic talks
The vaccine czar said he will also initiate diplomatic talks with representatives from China, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan – through the help of the DFA – so that the Philippines will have priority of a potential vaccine once it becomes available in the market.
Talks with pharmaceutical giants Zuellig Pharma and Unilab, Inc. are also ongoing for the availability of cold chain storage facilities, Galvez bared.
“There are pharmaceutical companies that have cold chain storage. May vaccine po na kailangan na negative 20 to negative 80 degree Celsius ang refrigeration,” he said.
“Kung magpo-produce po tayo ng cold storage, tayo ang magproduce sa gobyerno, it will take time,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The country’s vaccine experts panel is currently evaluating the application of an Australian pharmaceutical firm to conduct clinical trial Phase 3 for its COVID-19 candidate vaccine in the Philippines.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director-General Rolando Enrique Domingo
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director-General Rolando Enrique Domingo said that the vaccine experts panel informed him Friday, October 30 that Australia’s Clover Biopharmaceuticals has submitted its applications to hold clinical trials here.
“We have been officially informed by the vaccine experts panel that there is a company that has shown interest (in) doing clinical trials here in the Philippines and they are now undergoing pre-screening,” said Domingo in an online forum.“Clover Biopharmaceuticals from Australia is now also being evaluated by the vaccine experts panel;” he added.
Currently, there are now four vaccine developers that are undergoing evaluation. The other three are: China’s Sinovac Biotech, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, and United States of America’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals of Johnson & Johnson.
Sinovac Biotech, which was “endorsed positively” by the vaccine expert panel, is still undergoing evaluation from the Single Joint Research Ethics Board and the FDA. The vaccine panel cleared Sinovac for clinical trials last October 15.
Janssen Pharmaceuticals is still in the pre-screening stage of the vaccine expert panel, Domingo said.
Meanwhile, the vaccine expert panel is still awaiting additional documents from the Gamaleya Research Institute before they could formally begin the evaluation of its candidate vaccine called “Sputnik V.”
“I asked for some updates on that…meron pang mga tanong at hinihingi ang vaccine experts panel. And when they submit that, formal evaluation by the vaccine expert panel will start,” said Domingo.
Aside from these four vaccine developers, Domingo said that there are other pharmaceutical companies that are showing interest in conducting clinical trials in the Philippines.
“I think there are at least…maybe right now… seven or eight companies that have been asking for the process, requirements. But of course, until they submit an actual protocol for the vaccine experts panel for pre-screening, we do not count them as applicants for clinical trials,” said Domingo.
“But yes, there have been several companies from all over asking for the requirements and processes for clinical trials,” he added.
One of those who expressed interest is United Kingdom’s Astrazeneca Pharmaceuticals.
“I think they’ve already asked the vaccine experts panel about conducting clinical trials here and they were already given the information on what is required and what the process is,” said Domingo.
“Of course if they would decide to make an application then the government is ready to evaluate. But so far they have not yet submitted (an application),” he added.
With these developments, Domingo reminded the public that there are still no approved clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines.
“Wala pang approve na clinical trial [No clinical trial has been approved yet]. Yung [The] most advanced is still undergoing evaluation and we hope to have a decision within one to two weeks…either give an approval or a denial,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement following text messages being circulated saying that COVID-19 vaccines are now being sold in the Philippines for P50,000 per shot.
In his Thursday press briefing, Roque said the sale of unapproved drugs is prohibited.
“Bawal po iyan (That is not allowed),” he said.
The Palace official likewise warned those who are behind the messages being circulated saying they can be punished.
“Mayroon pong ipinapataw na parusa sa kahit sinong magbebenta ng gamot o bakuna na hindi po aprubado ng FDA (There is a punishment for those who are selling drugs or vaccines that are not approved by the FDA),” Roque said.
“Mayroon pong kulong iyan, itigil ninyo po iyan (You can be imprisoned so stop that),” he added.
Roque said this week that the government has already discussed assigning a vaccine czar to take care of the logistics for the COVID-19 vaccines.
This month, President Duterte assured the public that he already has the funds for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines. According to Malacañang, an initial 20 million Filipinos will get the vaccine for free.
Roque said this month that the estimated price for a vaccine is US$10 per dose. An individual should have two doses of the vaccine.
He added that if the vaccine will be available this year, the government will have to borrow from the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines to buy them. However, if it will be released next year, the funds for the vaccine will be taken from the proposed P4.5-trillion 2021 national budget. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Pfizer executives expressed measured optimism Tuesday over the prospect of providing a coronavirus vaccine in 2020 even as they signaled key data on the vaccine would not be released before the US election.
Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said the drug giant could supply some 40 million doses in the United States in 2020 if clinical testing proceeds as expected and regulators approve a vaccine.
“If all goes well, we will be ready to distribute an initial number of doses,” said Bourla, who pointed to a US government contract for Pfizer to supply 40 million doses by the end of this year and 100 million doses by March 2021.But Bourla said the company still had not reached key benchmarks in assessing vaccine efficacy.Pfizer previously said it could have the data in October, which might have advanced the process ahead of the November 3 presidential election.
“We have reached the last mile here,” Bourla said. “So let’s all have the patience that’s required for something so important for public health and the global economy.”
He said the company expects to file for emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine in the third week of November, roughly in line with earlier timetables.
Asked if he was “bullish” the vaccine would work, Bourla said: “I’m cautiously optimistic that the vaccine will work.”
– Dip in doctor visits –
Pfizer reported a 71 percent drop in profit to $2.2 billion in the latest quarter. However, the comparable period last year included a large gain connected to a transaction.
Revenues dipped four percent to $12.1 billion, missing analyst estimates.Pfizer estimated a revenue hit of $500 million connected to Covid-19 due to lower pharma demand in China and fewer wellness visits by US patients.
The company saw an 11 percent drop in its hospital business in emerging markets, primarily due to fewer elective surgeries in China and shorter in-patient hospital stays in the country.
This effect was partially offset by increased demand for the Prevnar-13 vaccine for pneumonia “resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses,” the company said.Pfizer also cited strong performance in its biopharma business due to good sales for cancer drug Ibrance, anticoagulant Eliquis and other medications.
Rival drugmaker Merck also is working on coronavirus vaccines, but the company is at an earlier phase compared with Pfizer.
Merck said one coronavirus vaccine candidate had entered phase 1 development and a second candidate would reach that stage shortly.Merck reported a 55 percent jump in quarterly earnings to $2.9 billion on a one percent rise in revenues to $12.6 billion.

The Department of Health (DOH) is now preparing cold storage facilities in the country for storing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines once it becomes available, an official of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said.
“Very important na naka set up na ito. Ito naman talaga ang ginagawa ng DOH sa ngayon to make sure that the cold chain is ready in case na bumili na tayo ng vaccine (It is very important that it is set up. This is exactly what the DOH is doing right now to make sure that the cold chain is ready in case we already procure a vaccine),” said FDA Director-General Rolando Enrique Domingo during the Malacanang press briefing on Tuesday, Oct. 27.
Domingo noted that there is a specific temperature that should be maintained in order for a vaccine not to lose its efficacy.“Ang mga bakuna napaka sensitive nyan. Hindi yan parang gamot na tableta na pwedeng i-transport ng basta-basta lamang. Each and every vaccine, depende po kung alin ang bibilin natin, meron yan temperature na set kung saan maari lang syang ma-store,” he said.
(Vaccines are very sensitive. It is not like a tablet drug that can be transported easily. For each and every vaccine, depending on which one we buy, there is a specific temperature where it can only be stored.)
“Halimbawa ang vaccine na ito ay two to eight degrees lamang sya dapat, kapag nalagay sa lugar na 10 degrees biglang mag change ang kulay nyan at iyon, hindi na pwedeng gamitin. Itatapon na iyon,” he added.
(For example, this vaccine should only be kept in places with two to eight degrees temperatures, when it is placed in an area with a temperature of 10 degrees, the color will suddenly change and that it can no longer be used. It will be discarded.)
Sahar Pharmaceutical Representative Adeel Dhedi Bhyria said that it is best to prepare the storage equipment for vaccines right now before the supplies “run short.”
“I believe the most important part right now is that the Philippines should procure the supply of these equipment before they run short and the prices will jack up naturally. Not later when the supplies for these equipment run short and then we’ll have to pay a higher price,” said Bhyria, who was also at the Malacañang press briefing. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Brazil is a top testing ground for vaccines against Covid-19, but its plans for vaccinating its own population have been plunged into chaos by a political war waged by President Jair Bolsonaro.
In this file photo taken on July 24, 2020 Brazilian pediatric doctor Monica Levi, one of the volunteers who received the COVID-19 vaccine, works at the Specialized Clinic in Infectious and Parasitic Diseases and Immunizations (CEDIPI), in Sao Paulo, Brazil. (Photo by NELSON ALMEIDA / AFP)
Hit hard by the new coronavirus, Brazil has been tapped to help test several of the leading vaccine candidates, giving it a potential edge in the race to secure access to an eventual shot.
That could be a welcome silver lining for the country of 212 million people, which has the second-highest Covid-19 death toll in the world, at more than 157,000.But one promising test vaccine, developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech, has triggered the ire of the far-right president, who last week canceled his health minister’s plan to buy 46 million doses.
The vaccine’s most visible proponent in Brazil is the governor of the large and wealthy state of Sao Paulo, Joao Doria, who also happens to be one of Bolsonaro’s top opponents.
Thus “Joao Doria’s Chinese vaccine,” as Bolsonaro contemptuously called it, got caught up in an ideological firestorm fueled by jockeying for Brazil’s 2022 presidential election.
“No country in the world is interested in it,” Bolsonaro said of the vaccine, known as CoronaVac.He nixed his own government’s purchase order after coming under pressure from hardline supporters to ban what one called the “Chinese dictatorship’s vaccine.”
Bolsonaro, whose government has tense relations with Beijing, said China was “discredited” by the fact the virus “was born there.”
– ‘Borderline absurd’ –
“You have to read this situation in the context of the upcoming municipal elections (in November) and the presidential election” two years from now, when Bolsonaro is expected to seek a second term, said Geraldo Monteiro, a political scientist at Rio de Janeiro State University.“The vaccine is due to be produced (in Brazil) by the Butantan Institute, under the supervision of Sao Paulo state. That would be a political win for Doria, and (Bolsonaro) can’t allow that.”
The pandemic has widened the rift between Bolsonaro and Doria, of the center-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB).
Doria is a leading proponent of aggressive measures to contain the virus, while Bolsonaro has downplayed it as a “little flu” and railed against social distancing measures.
“Bolsonaro has politicized the pandemic from the outset,” said Monteiro.
“But some things can’t be politicized at the cost of people’s health. It’s completely irresponsible and borderline absurd.”Politics has displaced what ought to be the real debate around CoronaVac, said professor Anthony Pereira, head of the Brazil Institute at King’s College London.
“Joao Doria is an ambitious politician and if an institute in his state produced a successful vaccine I have no doubt that he would try to benefit from that politically,” he said.
“But the bottom line should be: does the vaccine work? Would it protect the health of the Brazilian people?”
– Bolsonaro’s ‘biggest mistake’? –
More than 85 percent of Brazilians say they want to be vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a poll in the journal Nature.
But Bolsonaro’s “very problematic” attitude “causes doubts in the population about the vaccine,” said Lucio Renno, head of the Institute of Political Science at the University of Brasilia.
Bolsonaro’s government has meanwhile allocated 1.9 billion reais ($338 million) to purchase 100 million doses of another vaccine being tested in Brazil, developed by Oxford University and Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.
It is too early to say which vaccine or vaccines will emerge as the safest and most effective against Covid-19.
“Being against (CoronaVac) for ideological reasons might become (Bolsonaro’s) biggest mistake,” said Renno.
The president said Monday he saw no reason to stress over the race for a vaccine.
“I don’t know why we should be running after this,” he told supporters outside the presidential palace in Brasilia.
He then doubled down on his own preferred plan to handle the pandemic: hydroxychloroquine.
Bolsonaro has pushed the drug despite a raft of studies finding it is ineffective against the new coronavirus, and took it himself when he contracted the virus in July.
“Isn’t it cheaper and easier to invest in a cure than a vaccine?” he said.
“Look at me: I took hydroxychloroquine…. And it worked.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Israel will begin its first clinical trials of a novel coronavirus vaccine next month, authorities said Sunday, as the country grapples with a second wave of infections.Early in the pandemic, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tasked the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) with developing a vaccine against the virus.
Covid-19 has killed over 2,370 people in the Jewish state since the start of the outbreak there, and has infected more than 300,000, according to official figures.
On Sunday, authorities announced that the first clinical trials of the “BriLife” vaccine would begin on November 1, as a spokesperson for the defence ministry said the “necessary approvals” had been granted.
The trials will be conducted over several months. “Our final goal is 15 million rations for the residents of the state of Israel and for our close neighbours,” IIBR head Shmuel Shapira was quoted as saying in a statement.
Scientists around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, which has killed over 1.1 million people.Several dozen vaccine candidates are currently being tested in clinical trials, ten of which are in the most advanced “phase 3” stage involving tens of thousands of volunteers.

“All the ongoing final stages of human clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of potential COVID-19 vaccines are for now targeting only the general adult population who are 18 years of age or older,” Defensor, House Committee on Health vice chairman, said in a statement.
“While COVID-19 vaccines may possibly be approved for emergency use on the general adult population by the second half of 2021, drug regulators around the world, including our own Food and Drug Administration here, are bound to require further clinical studies to ascertain the safety of the boosters on children,” he pointed out.According to Defensor, children and pregnant women are usually the last to be tested when it comes to experimental biological products. He also noted that pharmaceutical agents “are targeting the general adult population.”
“We must stress that all the prospective COVID-19 shots in advance trials are unlike other vaccines—such as those for measles, polio, and tetanus—that were designed from the start to be given to children,” he said.
The party-list lawmaker made the remark as the Department of Health (DOH) prepared to launch its month-long immunization drive for babies and toddlers against measles-rubella and polio.
Widespread immunization against COVID-19 is not expected until mid-2021, despite anticipation of progress in producing available vaccines, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Several experimental coronavirus vaccines are already undergoing the last phase of human trials around the world. The trials are expected to last three to six months, or until the first quarter of 2021.The Philippine government is eyeing the immunization of an initial 20 million Filipinos once it gets its hands on a vaccine. Expected to be prioritized for the shots are senior citizens and individuals with comorbidities.
The country has an estimated population of 110 million.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, chairman of the Senate health and demography committee, on Saturday emphasized the need to ensure that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine to be used in the country is safe and effective.

“It is important that this COVID-19 vaccine is safe for our countrymen,” Go said during a radio interview Saturday, adding that the proper development process must be followed before using a vaccine.
According to Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque, the timeline of vaccine development and trial in the country is until March, 2021 – the time phase 3 trial is expected to be completed,” he said.“It means this will undergo clinical trials. It is important that this is safe for Filipinos,” he added.
Once a vaccine is certified safe and effective for use, the senator from Davao said that the poor and vulnerable sectors must be prioritized so they could immediately resume their lives normally.
“Once the vaccine is available and declared safe, President Duterte and I will prioritize the poor and the vulnerable sectors,” said Go, former Special Assistant to President Duterte.
He warned against rushing the production and availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, saying “let us not rush it because it is important that this has to be tested and declared safe.”
“We do not want another controversy to happen in this vaccine. The life of every Filipino is paramount,” he said.
Meanwhile, Go said that there is an ongoing collaboration between multinational drug companies and Philippine authorities regarding the conduct of clinical trials and access to the COVID-19 vaccine.
“I have also talked to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Administrator Director General Eric Domingo last night and there are various companies, like Sinovac, applying for trial in the Philippines. Now, the next move is to have a clinical trial here in our country and I’m sure that there are more offers coming,” Go said.The senator also urged the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the lead agency in charge of the COVID-19 clinical trials, to ensure that the processes are expedited but still in accordance with the applicable scientific standards.
“We have to wait and be patient. It is important to ensure that this is safe. There is already an ongoing coordination with the World Health Organization on vaccine development and they have identified places and hospitals that will be used for the clinical trial phase 3,” he said.
“It is important that this has to pass the clinical trials,” he pointed out.
Earlier, Go said that the government had already set aside funds for the purchase and development of the COVID-19 vaccine and is looking to secure additional funding to expand the immunization program.
Until then, Go encouraged the public to continue adhering to the health and safety protocols, such as wearing masks and face shields, observing social distancing and frequent hand washing, among others, to prevent the further spread of the virus.
“I’m glad Filipinos are disciplined and are following government protocols. Just cooperate with the government. This is for your own safety. We are doing everything for you,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Chinese firm recently passed the evaluation of the Department of Science and Technology ‘s vaccine experts panel, which was first of the three stages of evaluation required before a clinical trial can be conducted.“Ang nakalusot sa pre-screening ng vaccine experts panel ay yung Sinovac galing China na today ay nag apply na rin po sa FDA ng permission to conduct a clinical trial here [The one who got through the pre-screening of the vaccine experts panel was Sinovac from China, which today also applied to the FDA for permission to conduct a clinical trial here],” said FDA Director-General Rolando Enrique Domingo during a televised public briefing.
“Yun pong Phase I and Phase II na kanyang mga resulta na tiningnan ng vaccine experts panel ay nakita naman po na very mild lamang ang mga side effects, nothing serious kaya rin naman po ito nakapasa sa kanila [The results of its Phase I and Phase II (clinical trials) that were looked at by the vaccine experts panel– they saw that the side effects were very mild— nothing serious, so it passed their evaluation],” said Domingo.Domingo said that the evaluation of the Single Joint Research Ethics Board for the Sinovac candidate vaccine is also ongoing.“Nandyan din yung ethics review to make sure na protektado ang safety ng mga magiging clinical trial participants [There is also an ethics review to ensure the safety of the clinical trial participants],” he said.It will take two to three weeks for the FDA to review Sinovac’s application for clinical trials, said Domingo.

A decision support model that aims to provide an analytical and systematic approach in the allocation of COVID-19 drugs and hopefully vaccines once it becomes available was presented in a webinar led by the Dela Salle University Data Science Institute on Thursday, Oct. 22.Project Lead Dr. Charlle Sy of the Industrial Engineering Department of the DLSU, said that she along with her team during the onset of the pandemic, witnessed how the current healthcare system got overwhelmed with the surge of COVID-19 cases.
“News outlets were reporting how hospitals have started to turn away patients and patients had to go from one hospital to another, just to look for empty spaces or empty beds,” Sy said.“And during that time. People were hoping that a vaccine would soon be developed… I guess we’ve come to realize that vaccines are a long way to go. And when that vaccine becomes available. The actual distribution is an entirely different problem,” she added.
Sy mentioned that during that scenario, medical practitioners, pharmaceutical companies turned to repurposing commercially-available drugs like Remdesivir, to treat COVID patients which are only limited.
“Everything that we have is limited in quantity, even if we want to distribute these drugs, even if we want to accommodate all patients, there’s simply enough or not enough supply to go around,” she said.
Sy recalled that this became a topic of their group when the entirety of Luzon was placed under an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ).“One of the questions was that: How do we actually allocate these resources, do we give them to the most vulnerable? Those that probably would be under the senior age category? Or do we give them to those that would have the highest chance of surviving the disease?” she said.Being in the field of engineering, Sy and her team thought that there must be an analytical approach that will allow them to address the issue in a more systematic manner. They then decided to formulate a model that would address the questions while also considering multiple factors such as patient fatalities, drug efficiency, and hospital capacity.
According to them, simulations show that using an optimal allocation plan was found to be better than simply allocating the drugs for a particular purpose when necessary.“We want to get the word out there that we’re doing something like this, because we believe that other people could help us enrich this by giving their own ideas and their own insights,” Sy said.
She added that the logical next step now is to translate their present findings to vaccine allocations as it is anticipated to be developed in the future and that the allocation is a huge problem that needs to be tackled in an analytical way.
They also aim to engage potential stakeholders in the industry.
“This work couldn’t be done by a single group. If more groups are working on it, then there’s a better chance that it gets the objective that it wants to achieve,” Sy said.
In August, the country reserved three million vaccines worth at least P1.5 billion through the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.COVAX requires that the country commits to a minimum of three percent of the population but assured that up to 20 percent can be procured once the vaccine becomes available.
Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Health Research and Development Executive Director Dr. Jaime Montoya said three percent will be used for healthcare workers, frontliners, while the remaining 17 percent will be for high risk people like the elderly. The remaining 80 percent will then be negotiated. The webinar was presented together with Animo Labs Foundations Inc., a DLSU technology business incubator for the commercialization of research projects, inventions, and creative ideas.

Paje appealed to 4PS beneficiaries to wait for further announcement through its various social media platforms.
As of January 31, 2020, there are more than 4.2 million “active” 4Ps beneficiaries.
Last Tuesday, DSWDspokesperson Irene Dumlao expressed the agency’s elation over President Duterte’s pronouncement last week that the 4Ps recipients will be the first to receive the coronavirus vaccines, along with the country’s security forces. in his public address on Wednesday evening last week, President Duterte said the 4Ps beneficiaries and the security forces who are are vital in securing the country will be the first recipients of the COVID-19 vaccine. He anticipated that the vaccine is expected to arrive in the country in April 2021 at the earliest.He announced that the Russia is committed to construct a pharmaceutical plant in the country to produce the vaccines.

A volunteer participating in clinical trials of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University has died in Brazil, officials announced Wednesday, though media reports said he had received a placebo, not the test vaccine.
A clinical trial of a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University will continue despite the death of a volunteer in Brazil, as a review did not reveal safety concerns Vincenzo PINTO AFP/File
It is the first death reported in the various coronavirus vaccine trials taking place worldwide.
However, organizers of the study said an independent review had concluded there were no safety concerns and that testing of the vaccine, developed with pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, would continue.Media reports said the volunteer was a 28-year-old doctor working on the front lines of the pandemic who died of complications from Covid-19.
Brazilian newspaper Globo and international news agency Bloomberg said he was in the control group and had received a placebo rather than the test vaccine, citing sources close to the trials.
“Following careful assessment of this case in Brazil, there have been no concerns about safety of the clinical trial, and the independent review in addition to the Brazilian regulator have recommended that the trial should continue,” Oxford said in a statement.
AstraZeneca said medical confidentiality meant it could not give details on any individual volunteer, but that independent review had “not led to any concerns about continuation of the ongoing study.”Brazil’s national health regulator, Anvisa, confirmed it had been notified of the case on October 19.
The D’Or Teaching and Research Institute (IDOR), which is helping organize the tests in Brazil, said the independent review had “raised no doubts about the safety of the study, and recommended it continue.”
Oxford and AstraZeneca previously had to suspend testing of the vaccine in September when a volunteer in Britain developed an unexplained illness.
Trials resumed after British regulators and an independent review concluded the illness was not a side effect of the vaccine.
Half the volunteers in the final-stage clinical trial — a double-blind, randomized, controlled study — receive a placebo, IDOR said.
Around 8,000 volunteers have been vaccinated so far in Brazil, and more than 20,000 worldwide, it said.
Study participants must be doctors, nurses or other health sector workers who come into regular contact with the virus.
The deceased volunteer was a young doctor who had been treating Covid-19 patients since March in the emergency rooms and intensive care units at two hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Globo said.
He graduated from medical school last year, and was in good health prior to contracting the disease, family and friends told the newspaper. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“Without admitting the regularity and even the constitutionality of the post 3rd reading ‘institutional amendments’ by the (Lower) House as mentioned, I will definitely support and might even further augment the proposed amendments for the COVID-19 vaccines and the aid to displaced workers,” Lacson said when sought to comment on the P20-billion institutional amendment introduced by the House of Representatives committee in the budget bill.“That said, regardless of the constitutional infirmities involved, we can remedy it anyway by formalizing those flawed and constitutionally infirm amendments by the House when the Senate approves our own version of the budget measure all the way to the bicameral conference,” he further said.In an interview on CNN Philippines, Lacson said the P2.5-billion allocated by the government to procure the vaccines is insufficient to cover the 3.9 million Filipinos that need to be covered by the vaccination.“There’s only P2.5-billion for vaccines to cover 3.9 million Filipinos. Assuming there’s a vaccine available in April 2021, kulang na kulang ang P2.5-billion,” Lacson said.“So I’m thinking of augmenting another P10-Billion or at least ma-approximate ang P10-billion to cover more Filipinos. Kasi 3.9 million of 100 millionFilipinos masyadong maliit ang mako-cover (is such a small coverage),” he pointed out.And despite the “constitutional infirmities” involved, Lacson welcomed the House’s move to add P5-billion for the COVID-19 vaccines.“That’s good because we’ll just formalize it. I am not saying we are accepting the amendments introduced by the HOR after (found to be) not in compliance with (the) third reading approved budget version. Pero we’ll formalize it in the Senate and probably in the bicam (bicameral conference committee) we can finalize it,” he stressed.“Pagka may vaccines na next year, kailangan talaga natin (Once we have the vaccines next year, we really need)to cover as many Filipinos as we can. Kasi kung 3.9 million lang, how about the other 96 million Filipinos? Maghahawa-hawa rin yan (they will still infect the others),” Lacson pointed out. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Majority Leader and Leyte 1st District Rep. Martin Romualdez said that with the move of the small committee to set aside P5.5 billion for the purchase of vaccines, the government’s funding for such purpose now amounts to P8 billion.“This is to support President Rodrigo Duterte’s program to strengthen the country’s health care system. We believe that vaccines play a very crucial role in keeping the population safe and healthy from the pandemic,” he said.
Romualdez leads the small panel that is in charge of institutional amendments to the proposed P4.5 trillion 2021 national budget.
“We are working diligently to fulfill our constitutional duty of ensuring that funding for a safe and effective vaccine to control COVID-19 is guaranteed and will be available to Filipinos,” Romualdez said.Initially, some P2.5 billion have been included in the proposed national budget for 2021 for COVID-19 vaccines, especially in the spending plan of the Department of Health (DOH).
Romualdez said the P5.5 billion additional funding for the procurement of the vaccines is among theP20 billion institutional amendments made by the small committee in the 2021 General Appropriations Bill (GAB).He noted that his panel agreed to consider only institutional amendments and departmental errata.He added that the individual amendments will be accommodated during the bicameral conference committee when both the House and Senate come up with the final version of the spending measure.The Lower Chamber is seeking to transmit to the Senate the soft copy of the House-approved GAB containing its P20-billion institutional amendments on October 28.
Speaker Lord Allan Velasco said the House really intended to increase the funding for the purchase of vaccines, considering that the initial P2.5 billion allocation will only cover three percent of the country’s population of more than 100 million.He noted that to support President Duterte’s wish to inoculate at least 20 million poor Filipinos, the House should step in and increase the initial funding of P2.5 billion for the purchase of vaccines.

Salceda, in a virtual press briefing, said the allocation comes in the form of institutional amendments to the GAB of which a total of P20 billion was approved by the House small committee.He said the vaccine allocation was the single biggest item among the budget amendments.
“Actually it came from the Speaker (Lord Allan Velasco). May listahan siyang pina-consider sa amin pero hindi naman namin lahat sinunod (He gave us a list to consider but we didn’t follow all of it),” said Salceda.He said the P5.5 billion will be added to the P2-billion fund for vaccines that solons set aside earlier.“The needs are fairly obvious eh. Why is the biggest item for vaccines? I don’t think there will be any argument that you need to fund vaccines beyond the P2 billion,” the Bicolano said.Acknowledging that the funds aren’t huge, Salceda said the P20 billion under the National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF) may be tapped for the purchase of vaccines. “Because pandemic is defined under RA (Republic Act) 10121 as a disaster.”
Salceda pegged the cost of the as yet unavailable vaccine at P700 per shot. He said Filipinos with comorbidities and senior citizens would be prioritized for the vaccine in order to maximize the limited funds.The Philippines has an estimated population of 110 million people.Salceda also bared that the institutional amendments to the budget measure would include P2 billion worth of “pandemic assistance to afflicted families.”He said another P300 million will be funneled to the Department of Health for “mental health” purposes – something that presumably is also meant to mitigate the ongoing public health crisis.
Meanwhile, the second largest item among the amendments is the P4-billion allocation to the Department of Labor and Employment. It will be used for the benefit of workers displaced by the pandemic, Salceda said.
The rest of the amendments are as follows: P2 billion to the Armed Forces of the Philippines for the acquisition of two C-130 planes; P2 billion for the Health Facilities Enhancement Program, basically to complete construction of unfinished hospitals; P2 billion to the Department of Interior and Local Government for police mobility assets; P1.75 billion to the Department of Education for Internet connectivity; P500 million to the Energy Regulatory Commission for self-sufficiency and renewable energy (RE); and P400 million to the Philippine National Oil Company for redevelopment and modernization.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) urged the government not to prioritize those who are “wealthy, powerful, and influential” once the vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available.
In a moral guidance, the CBCP said that the government should ensure that the vaccine should be given first to those “who are most at risk for infection and for severe disease.”
“We propose this allocation plan for the COVID-19 vaccine that prioritizes those who are at most risk for infection or for severe disease because of our concern that in the Philippines, vaccines may be allocated first to those who are wealthy, powerful, and influential,” said the CBCP.“Pope Francis has said, ‘It would be sad if, for the vaccine for COVID-19, priority were to be given to the richest!’ As the pope has said many times, ‘The preferential option for the poor is at the center of the Gospel,’” it added.
The CBCP said that prioritizing those in the upper class will not help in immediately solving the current health situation.
“This would not efficiently mitigate deaths in our communities and would delay the end of the pandemic in our country. This would be a great moral and social tragedy,” it said.
Medical frontliners should be the top priority for immunization, the CBCP said, as the country needs “healthy doctors and nurses to treat our sick so that our people can heal.”Adults who are at high risk for severe disease due to their age or underlying medical conditions should be next to receive a vaccine, the prelates said. “We especially need to shield our senior citizens who face the highest risk of death from COVID-19,” they said.
Third to prioritize should be essential workers “whose roles are inherently risky because of necessary interactions with the public,” the CBCP said.
These include teachers, grocery store workers, public transportation workers, police, firefighters, and national security personnel, among others, it said.Individuals who are living in “dense urban areas where they are vulnerable to the virus” should also be prioritized, the prelates said.
“We urge our national government to provide the COVID-19 vaccine to everyone without cost to the individual. Otherwise it will not be available to the poor,” the CBCP said.
The government should be transparent and ensure the welfare of those who will volunteer to participate in any clinical trials for COVID-19 candidate vaccines, the CBCP said.
By doing so, this will help bolster “public confidence in the initiatives of medical and governmental authorities,” it said.
“We remind our public health authorities and the pharmaceutical companies involved that these COVID-19 vaccine Phase III clinical trials must be conducted adhering to the highest ethical standards and best scientific practices,” the CBCP said.
“Full transparency is critical at every step of the development and distribution of a candidate vaccine to ensure the safety and effectiveness of every approved vaccine in an immunization campaign,” it added.
Before any Phase III clinical trial commences, the results of the Phase I and II clinical trials of candidate vaccines should be first evaluated by designated ethics and expert panels and approved by our national regulatory agencies, the CBCP said.
“The data should be made publicly available so that other scientists and medical professionals can confirm the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine,” it said.
“Every participant in these clinical trials must be guaranteed the highest possible standard of care if they experience any adverse reactions. In the case of unforeseen permanent bodily damage, or even death, compensation to the participant or family would be just,” it added.
The findings of the Phase III clinical trials must be made public, regardless of outcome, the CBCP said.
“It is our prayer that the clinical trials conducted in our country will benefit the global effort to end the pandemic,” it said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Congress should allocate at least P20 billion, not the measly P2.5 billion under the 2021 budget proposal, to procure COVID-19 vaccine next year if the government is serious in protecting an initial 20 million poor Filipinos from the dreaded disease.
Anakalusugan Rep. Mike Defensor said the P2.5-billion allocation reflected in the proposed 2021 General Appropriations Act “is just a small fraction of what government needs to vaccinate the initial target of 20 million poor Filipinos.”
“That means an average of P1,000 per Filipino to be inoculated. Health professionals are saying one would need two to three doses to fight the infectious new coronavirus. If that is so, P1,000 would translate to P500 per dose, if two doses are needed, and P333, if three doses are required,” said Defensor, chairman of the House Committee on Public Accounts.He said multinational drug companies and the richest nations developing the new vaccine are not expected to distribute their precious invention cheap.“We will be lucky if we could get it at less than P500 per dose,” Defensor stated.He pointed out that the initial target is only roughly one-fifth or 20 percent of the country’s entire population.Defensor said assuming the vaccine would cost P500 per dose and one would require two doses, the P2.5 billion in next year’s budget would be good only for 2.5 million Filipinos.
“And President Duterte is aiming to inoculate all 113 million Filipinos. Clearly, there is a need for us to provide sufficient funds. There is still time to do it because the proposed budget is still with us in Congress,” he said.Defensor noted that the Department of Health has estimated its funding requirement for 20 million poor Filipinos at P12.9 billion, or P645 per vaccine.“Their estimate means that a dose would cost only P322.50, if two doses are needed. I hope they are right. But there’s no harm in allocating an amount that would exceed the actual cost of the vaccine. The excess would be used in procuring more vaccines, which means more Filipinos would be vaccinated.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

There are six pharmaceutical firms that have signed a confidentiality disclosure agreement that would let the Philippines’ vaccine experts panel review the results of their respective Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials.These are the Gamaleye Research Institute from Russia, University of Queensland from Australia; Adimmune from Taiwan, and the Sinovac, Sinopharm and Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical from China.Dela Peña also confirmed that China’s Sinovac Biotech has passed the evaluation of the country’s vaccine expert panel but still needs to secure approval from the Single Joint Ethics Research Board and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they could commence the Phase III clinical trial of their candidate vaccine.“They are just waiting for the approval or endorsement of the Single Joint Ethics Research Board,” said Dela Peña.“Once they receive the final approval for the clinical trial from our FDA, the implementation will be fully undertaken by their local contract research organization (CRO), that can facilitate and help them in the actual implementation of the vaccine trials,” said the DOST chief.“We hope that they will be able to have already selected the contract research organizations. This is Philippine-based organizations,” he added.As for Russia’s Sputnik V, Dela Peña said that they are still evaluating its application for clinical trials.
New COVID-19 cases
The DOH, meanwhile, recorded 3,139 new cases of COVID-19 in the country. This pushed the total number of infections to 351,750 since the first case was detected last January.Of the total, 50,534 are active cases or patients who are still recuperating. The DOH said that 84.7 percent of the active cases are mild, 10.8 percent are asymptomatic, 1.5 percent are in severe condition, while three percent are in critical condition.The majority of the newly confirmed cases were from the National Capital Region with 1,003, Cavite with 206, Rizal with 175, Laguna with 138, and Iloilo with 126 infections.
It was also reported that there were 34 new fatalities, taking the death toll to 6,531. Recoveries, meanwhile, jumped by 786 to 294,865.
Globally, there have been 38,394,169 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,089,047 deaths,data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go said that the government had already set aside funds for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines and is looking to secure additional funding to expand the immunization program.Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go (OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, reiterated President Duterte’s statements that the poor and vulnerable sectors as well as medical frontliners and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Philippine National Police (PNP) would be prioritized under the government’s plan to allocate COVID-19 vaccines once made available.Go, speaking after the turnover of newly acquired fire trucks and firefighting equipment in Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City, said that while there are funds set aside for the purchase of vaccines, the Duterte administration is looking for finance managers for additional funding in case this is not enough.
“Ulitin ko lang po, pag mayroon na hong vaccine na available at once declared na safe na po itong iturok sa tao ay uunahin po ni Pangulo Duterte ‘yung mga mahihirap.

Galvez was asked about the government’s contingency plans after it was bared that only P2.5 billion were alloted in the 2021 national budget for the purchase of vaccines.
“Napag-usapan na namin sa gabinete ‘yan na mayroon nang strategy si DoF (Department of Finance)sa payments and preparations ng vaccines (We already talked about it in the Cabinet (meetings) and the Department of Finance has prepared a strategy for the payments and preparations of the vaccines),” Galvez said during the launching of the McDonald’s “M Safe” campaign which aims to test 20,000 of its employees and 1,000 tricycle drivers in Pasig City.Aside from the budget allocation, the government has also prepared the supply chain and cold chain storage of the vaccine to preserve its potency, and other collateral expenses that may be needed, he added.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III hadearlier said that the government will need approximately P20 billion to buy doses of vaccine for 20 million Filipinos if it is made available by the first or second quarter of 2021.
The DoF reportedly made initial plans to loan the amount from the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) or the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).
“The Department of Finance has prepared how we could procure, deliver, and distribute and the Department of Health also has a program with the Department of Science and Technology sa (in the) distribution,” he said.Last Wednesday, President Duterte said in a public address that the government has enough funds to buy the vaccines but noted that there is a need for more money to inoculate all 113 million Filipinos.
“I have the money already for the vaccine but hahanap pa ako ng maraming pera (I will look for more money). You know, there are now 113 million Filipinos and, to me, ideally, all should have the vaccine. Without exception,” Duterte had said.
The President said the poorest of the poor, the police, and military will be given priority once the vaccines arrive in the country.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

https://mb.com.ph/2020/10/16/cross-national-accessibility-of-covid-vaccines-nationalism-versus-multilateralism/,Cross-national accessibility of COVID vaccines – nationalism versus multilateralism,by Professor Zha Daojiong,"Published October 16, 2020, 9:52 AM","Professor Zha DaojiongAround the world, great hope is placed on vaccines as an instrument for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. With the winter flu season in the northern hemisphere and many societies still struggling with containing the spread of the virus, loosening of international travel restrictions continues to be limited, which in turn hampers the world’s return to normalcy.
Much progress has been achieved in the search for vaccines. Yet, vaccine production necessitates a constant process of refinement through research, clinical trials, and gathering of data to prove its safety and effectiveness. Only upon approval by national health authorities can a vaccine be mass-produced and then made available for mass inoculation, with the eventual goal of realizing mass immunity.
Around 40 candidate vaccines are registered with the World Health Organization (WHO), with nine of them – four by Chinese vaccine developers — in the third and final clinal trial phase. For any of these products to successfully reach the state of mass use, there is still a scientific process to complete. Some inevitably are to be eliminated.Production of a vaccine is a demanding endeavor in terms of financial and technological input. Quality assurance is a necessary precondition, which must result from proven health safety and effectiveness on human participants in the development process. Only a few countries have the resources to produce vaccines to meet demand for immunization of their own populations.
Accordingly, some countries opt to partake in vaccine development initiated in other countries, including bottling and transportation. Some other countries will have to procure from available international pool of successful vaccines. The WHO’s vaccine prequalification offers a technical reference for such procurement.
Globally, gaps between demand for vaccines and available dosages are a predictable reality, at least in the initial stage, partly due to uncertainty a producer faces in marketable doses of a product. To address this foreseeable challenge, the WHO, in collaboration with the Global Alliance of Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) offered the Covax Facility arrangement. The facility envisions making available two billion doses of COVID vaccines for use in middle- and low-income developing countries, covering some 20 percent of their total populations.
Against the odds, vaccine nationalism is a common choice of action by developed countries equipped with the scientific and technological capacity as well as financial resources to cover the associated costs. Although no vaccine has yet received approval for use, with only candidate vaccines that meet technical standards for emergency use, several developed country governments have signed advance purchase agreements with vaccine developing corporations to satisfy future needs of their respective domestic populations. The United States, Great Britain, European member states, and Japan are said to have secured right to 130 million doses potential COVID vaccines.Accessibility is but one of the many challenges the world is facing in vaccine distribution. If COVID vaccines are sold at market price levels, most low-income and some mid-income countries will encounter the predicament of affordability. To be fair, though, even with commonly available vaccines, affordability is a long-standing challenge for developing economies. GAVI, an alliance of vaccine producers, addresses the matter by dividing developing country beneficiaries into two categories, with one having to pay full costs and the other subsidized prices.
Covax Facility is a multilateral arrangement. Its proponents champion it as the biggest effort at international cooperation since the Paris climate agreement. Emergence of the arrangement manifests acceptance of treating international health as a public good, which China champions. Product developers and users negotiate through the platform to realize the goal of mutual protection.
Vaccine nationalism, meanwhile, has its historical precedent. To deal with the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010, a small number of developed economies chose to bond with each other on the merit of research and paying capabilities, with a few even hoarding successful vaccines. Developing economies were offered the product only after deployment needs had been met in developed ones, by which time the pandemic had come to an end. There resulted a surplus and waste of vaccines. As such, vaccine nationalism can be a double-edged sword.COVID-19 is an entirely different challenge, unprecedented in one century. Economies will be tempted to ensure and expand domestic capacities of vaccine production. But a scenario cannot be ruled out whereby curbs are imposed on global movement of materials for vaccine ingredients, packaging, and injection. That will be another form of vaccine nationalism. After all, cross-national flow of vaccine products is a component of international competition in trade and investment, which comes with its share of frictions and conflicts over product branding and extended economic and political interests.
In the real world, public health is a sphere in which geopolitically motivated maneuvering takes place. Procurement of a vaccine, when a product’s nationality becomes a core choice factor, can become yet another manifestation of vaccine nationalism. For a procurement decision to be made without due regard to scientific facts behind pathobiology would be against common sense in therapeutic terms. It might earn some momentary gains in political maneuvering but amount to irresponsibility towards citizens so affected.
According to publicized information, in the Covax Facility, China is not going to receive preferential treatment when it comes to per unit price of participating vaccines, reflecting the fact that its per capita income is in the upper level of middle income economies. But China stands to have an opportunity to function as both a product supplier and purchaser under the platform, especially in the event of domestic product falling short of meeting demand. As a supplier, joining group negotiation can help save time and human resource input that comes with relying on bilateral channels.
A multilateral arrangement for COVID vaccine distribution, meanwhile, should not be viewed as a confrontation with acts of vaccine nationalism. The prevailing COVID-19 challenges are such that spread of the virus pays no regard to an individual’s nationality, nation-state boundaries, or gaps in aggregate or individual capacity to afford a product. The sooner and the more societies reach the stage of herd immunity through effective immunization by vaccination, the greater for realization of hope for trade and travel to restore normalcy among various economies. In this sense, practices of multilateralism in vaccine access and affordability are also in line with protecting an economy’s own public health security.
As a matter of fact, many nations, including members of the European Union, have opted to join multilateral vaccine arrangements, in addition to pursuing bilateral means of product acquisition.
The world’s search for etiological origins of the COVID-19 virus is still under way. Whether or not future demand for a COVID vaccine will evaporate, like that in the wake of the SARS pandemic in 2002-2003, remains an unknown as well.
All in all, the world is witnessing a race between vaccine nationalism and multilateralism. Being part of a multilateral arrangement is one way to prepare for multiple future scenarios.

A COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech has passed the review of the Philippines’ vaccine experts panel for clinical trials in the country, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) bared Thursday.
(NOEL CELIS / AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)
FDA Director General Rolando Enrique Domingo said that the vaccine experts panel, chaired by the Department of Science and Technology, has cleared Sinovac for Phase 3 clinical trials. However, the Chinese firm still needs to get an approval from the Philippines’ Ethics Board Committee before it can apply for the FDA for an application for clinical trials.
Domingo said that Sinovac passed the vaccine panel’s review last Monday.
“Meron na kaming hinihintay na mag-submit kasi inindorse na sa amin ng vaccine experts panel, hinihintay lang namin ‘yung submission nila ng documents. ‘Yung sa Sinovac (We are already waiting for a specific firm to submit (an application) because the vaccine experts panel has already endorsed it to us, we are just waiting for their submission of documents. Those in Sinovac),” said the FDA chief in an online forum.
If Sinovac is able to secure an approval from the Ethics Board, the FDA’s evaluation for its application for clinical trials would be 14 to 21 days, Domingo said.
“’Yung Ethics Board I think in progress pa. Hindi puwedeng maka start ang any study until hindi complete ang ethics approval (The Ethics Board (review) I think is still in progress. No clinical study can start until the ethics approval is complete),” he said.
The vaccine experts panel reviews the results of clinical trial Phase 1 and Phase 2 of a candidate vaccine while the Ethics Board checks the process of choosing the participants for the trials and other safeguards.
Domingo said that there is a possibility that the clinical study for Sinovac may begin in November given this development from the vaccine experts panel.
“It’s possible. Depende nga kung kailan mag submit ng application. Like I said, officially wala pang application sa FDA. Nasabihan lang kami ng vaccine experts panel na may pumasa na sa kanila (It’s possible. It depends on when they will submit their application. Like I said, there is still no application to the FDA. The vaccine experts panel just told us that a firm have already passed their review),” he said.
“We haven’t seen the application yet so we don’t know the details and it’s really a matter of when the submission is given to the FDA. Maaring next week pa sila mag-submit (They may submit it next week) or two weeks from now,” he added.
In a press briefing last Oct. 11, DoH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that three vaccine developers are seeking approval to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines. Aside from Sinovac, the other two are Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute and Jannsen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson from the United States. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

At least two lawmakers from the Visayas, including a former health secretary were cold on the President Duterte’s bid to seek additional funds for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines for all 130 million Filipinos.

Former Health secretary and Iloilo 1st Rep. Janette Garin said it may be premature for the Executive to ask for additional funding for the procurement of the vaccines at this point in time.
“If my memory recalls it right, an allocation of P10 billion was included under Bayanihan 2. Augmentation of an existing program is easy and doable with the powers of the Executive,” she said in a text message.“Hence, adding more budget without a definitive price at the moment might just end up with unutilized funds or vaccine pricing being exorbitant, just like what happened to PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) procurement,” she further explained.
Negros Oriental 2nd District Rep. Manuel Sagarbarria said the P2.5 billion included in the proposed P4.5-trillion national budget for 2021 for COVID-19 vaccines will be enough.
“Most of the people who can afford will have themselves vaccinated as soon as possible, those that can’t afford will rely on government. I believe P2.5 billion is sufficient,” he said in a separate text message.
He even noted that the private sector will also do their part in ensuring that their employees have additional protection against the coronavirus disease.“Even companies will have their employees vaccinated as soon as possible,” he said.
But, Anakalusugan Rep. Mike Defensor insisted that the House of Representatives should augment the funds allocated for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines next year.
“Congress should augment the budget for the procurement of the vaccine. I already made a statement on that P12.9 billion minimum should be programmed for the vaccination of 20 million poor Filipinos,” he said.He said the officials of the Department of Health already relayed to the House that they would need P12.9 billion to inoculate 20 million poor Filipinos.
“Since they have P2.5 billion in the proposed 2021 budget, they intend to source the shortfall from borrowings,” he said.
He said the House could realign appropriations in next year’s outlay instead of allowing the DOH to resort to loans.
“There is enough room in the budget proposal for realignments. For instance, we can reduce allocations for non-essential expenses like travel, dining and entertainment to finance the procurement of vaccines,” he said.
Defensor also called on the DOH to take a second look at its Covid-19 vaccination funding estimate.
“P12.9 billion for 20 million poor Filipinos amounts to an average of P645. Is P645 for one dose or two doses? It it enough to immunize each of the 20 million against the new coronavirus and Covid-19 disease?” he asked. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Developing countries must have ‘equal access’ to future Covid-19 vaccines, Indonesia’s foreign minister warned, as wealthy nations scoop up billions of doses.
Retno Marsudi said it was crucial for rich and poor nations to work together so “we can guarantee equal access to a safe and affordable vaccine”.
“Can you imagine…if most vaccines go to developed countries?” Marsudi told AFP in a video interview from London.“What will be the fate of the developing countries?”
Marsudi’s comments follow an Oxfam report last month that found a group of wealthy nations representing just 13 percent of the global population have already bought up more than half of the promised doses of future Covid-19 vaccines.Marsudi was to meet with UK-based pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca on Wednesday to cement a vaccine-dose deal for Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous nation with nearly 270 million people, which has struggled to contain soaring infection rates.
This week, Indonesia’s Covid-19 response team chief, Airlangga Hartarto, said the country may secure 100 million doses of AstraZeneca’s potential vaccine.Marsudi declined to discuss details, but said: “I’m very optimistic we can secure a significant number of vaccines from AstraZeneca”.
“The negotiation is still going on.”
Marsudi is also slated to go to Switzerland as part of her country’s bid to secure agreements for vaccine doses.In August, Indonesia kicked off human trials of a vaccine candidate produced by China’s Sinovac Biotech with some 1,600 volunteers taking part in the six-month study.
Indonesia, one of the hardest hit countries in Asia, has reported more than 340,000 cases of coronavirus and over 12,000 deaths. But, with some of the world’s lowest testing rates, the true scale of its public health crisis is believed to be much greater. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The financing “aims to support vaccination of up to a billion people,” the bank said in a statement.
The money is part of an overall World Bank Group (WBG) package of up to $160 billion through June 2021 designed to help developing countries battle the novel coronavirus pandemic.“This financing package helps signal to the research and pharmaceutical industry that citizens in developing countries also need access to safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines,” the statement read.“It will also provide financing and technical support so that developing countries can prepare for deploying vaccines at scale, in coordination with international partners.”
Access to safe and effective vaccines “and strengthened delivery systems is key to alter the course of the pandemic and help countries experiencing catastrophic economic and fiscal impacts move toward a resilient recovery,” World Bank Group President David Malpass said in the statement.
The financing “will also support countries to access to Covid-19 tests and treatments, and expand immunization capacity to help health systems deploy the vaccines effectively,” the statement added.The financing approval was expected as Malpass had announced the project in late September.
While vaccines have yet to appear on the market, Malpass noted in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro that it was necessary to prepare because of the complicated vaccine distribution process.
The Bank’s approach, according to the statement, draws on its “significant expertise in supporting large scale immunization programs for vaccine preventable diseases, as well as public health programs to tackle infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Johnson & Johnson said Monday it had temporarily halted its Covid-19 vaccine trial because one of its participants had become sick.
“We have temporarily paused further dosing in all our Covid-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials, including thePhase 3 ENSEMBLE trial, due to an unexplained illness in a study participant,” the company said in a statement.
The pause means the online enrollment system has been closed for the 60,000-patient clinical trial while the independent patient safety committee is convened.J&J said that serious adverse events (SAEs) are “an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies.” Company guidelines allowed them to pause a study to determine if the SAE was related to the drug in question and whether to resume study.

The country has covered all bases in getting access to potential coronavirus vaccines but will need the approval of the proposed 2021 national budget for the funding allocation, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said.
Nograles said the government’s budget proposal for next year includes the allocation for the procurement of the life-saving vaccines for the coronavirus.
“Ang tanong may pambayad ba tayo. Iba ‘yung access, iba ang pambayad so kaya nga worried din tayo at nag-aalala tayo sa budget na 2021 (The question is do we have the budget to pay for the vaccines. Access is different from budget for payment.

If the new spending plan is not passed on time, Nograles said the government will be compelled to operate on a reenacted budget, which does not include any budget item for vaccine purchase. He said the government would have look for other funding sources to buy the vaccines.
President Duterte has called on Congress to convene a special session from Oct. 13 to 16 to resume the deliberations on the proposed P4.506-trillion national budget for next year and avoid delays on its passage. The budget measure, which carries the theme “Reset, Rebound, and Recover: Investing for Resiliency and Sustainability,” has also been certified as urgent by the President to facilitate its swift congressional approval.
Under the budget bill, the government has proposed an initial P2.5 billion for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.The special session was called by the President in the wake of the escalating leadership conflict between Speaker Alan Cayetano and Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco the House of Representatives threatened to disrupt the passage of the budget on time.
So far, Nograles assured the public that the government has made arrangements to “reserve” the country’s access to potential COVID vaccines.
He said the country is involved with the World Health Organization’s solidarity trial as well as the COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access) facility, a global vaccine project to ensure equitable access for poor nations to the vaccines.The government has also coordinated with those developing vaccines in Russia, China, and United States for the country’s access once the medicines become available, Nograles said.
“So all bases covered tayo kasi ang mangyayari dito nag-uunahan ang lahat, kung sino ang unang maka-produce ng vaccine. Kahit sino sa kanila ang mauna, naka-reserve na tayo (We have all bases covered because everyone is racing to be the first to produce the vaccine.

DAVAO CITY – The Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) has been tapped to participate in the clinical trials of potential coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines in the Philippines.
In a phone interview, Dr. Ricardo Audan, office-in-charge (OIC) medical center chief, revealed that the government-run hospital was identified as one of the trial sites for the conduct of a large-scale Phase 3 of the clinical trials on potential vaccines against COVID-19.
Audan added that he received last week a letter from the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), informing him that SPMC has been selected as a trial site.The Department of Health (DOH) earlier confirmed that the Philippines was one of the countries “that will participate in the World Health Organization’s Solidarity Trial for Vaccines, a global effort to rapidly develop and evaluate possible candidate vaccines against the COVID-19.”
Audan said the DOST-PCHRD has been tasked to conduct clinical trials for the vaccines.
“The SPMC will be part of the vaccine trial, although it has yet to start,” he said.
He added that the hospital would comply with the requirements of the DOST-PCHRD.“I presented it during our task force regular meeting at the SPMC. There are several requirements before a hospital could participate but, by principle, we will accept it,” he said.
Audan added that he was confident that SPMC would be able to comply with the requirements just in time for the start of the vaccine trials.
He said the agency has not identified which potential vaccine would be tested in the government-run hospital.The Gamaleya Research Institute from Russia, Jannsen Pharmaceuticals Companies of Johnson & Johnson from the United States, and Sinovac from China have applied to do clinical trials in the Philippines.
The 1,500-bed SPMC is the country’s largest government hospital catering to patient-referrals from other regions outside Davao, and is the biggest COVID-19 referral hospital in Mindanao.The region’s three COVID-19 referral hospitals are SPMC, Davao Regional Medical Center in Tagum City, and Davao Doctors Hospital’s Dumoy facility in Davao City.
As of October 9, DOH-Davao reported a total of 3,464 COVID cases in the region with 2,753 recoveries and 114 deaths.
Of this total, 2,244 were reported in Davao City, 242 in Davao de Oro, 387 in Davao del Norte, 224 in Davao del Sur, 86 in Davao Occidental, and 281 in Davao Oriental. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The review will pave the way for them to proceed with the application for Phase 3 clinical trial in the Philippines.DoST Secretary Fortunato dela Pena during his weekly report on Friday said that the DoST, through the Sub-Technical Working Group on Vaccine Development, is also finalizing the CDA for TianyuanBiopharma in China and reviewing the agreements for Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Arcturus Therapeutics, both of the USA.
The department is also helping these foreign vaccine developers by connecting them to local Contract Research Organizations (CROs) that will help them facilitate their clinical trials in the Philippines. He said that the DoST, through the Sub-TWG, has been in contact with 17 biotech and pharmaceutical companies in seven countries – Sinopharm, Sinovac, Anhui Zhifei, Ghuangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, and Tianyuan Biopharma, all from China; Adimmune Corp., AcademicaSinica, and National Health Research Institute and Chang Gung University, all from Taiwan; Gamaleya and VEKTOR of Russia; Moderna, Pfizer, and Texas Children’s Hospital in the USA; University of Queensland and Seqirus of Australia; AnGes/Takara Bio of Japan; University of Saskatchewan in Canada; and Bharat Biotech of India.

The Department of Health (DOH) expressed openness to Russia’s plan of setting up a manufacturing facility for its COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
Health Assistant Secretary Maria Vergeire (Facebook)
“Isa po iyan sa tinitingnan natin sa ngayon kasama naman sa pag-uusap ang Department of Trade and Industry at saka yung iba pang ahensya ng ating gobyerno at ito po ay masusi nating pinag-aaralan [That is one of the things we are looking at right now, including the Department of Trade and Industry as well as the other agencies of our government and we are studying it carefully],” said DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
The Health official made the remark after DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez and Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev discussed the possibility of manufacturing and distributing Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines.
Vergeire said that Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also met with Khovaev recently.
“Nakipag meeting sya kay Secretary Duque and isa iyan sa pinag-usapan talaga. Hindi lang yung fill and finish na manufacturing plant meron talagang planta ng bakuna [He had a meeting with Secretary Duque and that was one of the things discussed. It’s not only the fill and finish manufacturing plant but there’s a discussion of a manufacturing plant for vaccines],” said Vergeire.“This will provide us with that advantage. Hindi lang dito sa pandemyang ito but in the coming years na magkakaroon tayo uli ng mga pangangailangan na ganito [This will provide us with an advantage. Not only for the current pandemic but in the coming years if everwe will have a need like this again],” she added.Meanwhile, Vergeire said thatRussia’s Gamaleya Research Institute,Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and China’s Sinovac Biotech have already submitted an application for the possible conduct of Phase 3 clinical trials of their respectivevaccines here.
Also, there are six pharmaceutical firms that have signed confidentiality disclosure agreements, which would allow the country’s own vaccine experts panel to review the results of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of their respective vaccines.These are: Gamaleye Research Institute from Russia, University of Queensland from Australia; Adimmune from Taiwan, and the Sinovac, Sinopharm and Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical from China.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Francis Tolentino questioned on Friday, Oct. 9, the Department of Science and Technology’s (DOST) involvement in the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines.
Sen. Francis Tolentino
Speaking in the daily “Laging Handa” briefing of the government, Tolentino said that while he respects the DOST, the matter should be left to the expertise of medical doctors in the Department of Health (DOH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“Bakit napunta sa DOST (Why was is designated to the DOST)? Ginagalang ko po ‘yon, mga scientist po ‘yon pero dapat po ito purely (I respect that they are also scientists but this is purely a DOH mandate, to include the FDA,” Tolentino said.“Dahil ang clinical trials po ay tungkol po ito sa medisina. Ginagalang ko po ang DOST…pero ‘yong clinical trials po ay tungkol po sa human anatomy, tungkol po ito sa medicines and medical devices ang kailangan po ay ‘yong mga doktor sa kalusugan (Because clinical trials are about medicine. I respect the DOST, but clinical trials are about human anatomy, about medicines, and medical services that should concern health doctors instead),” the lawmaker noted.
In his privilege speech on Tuesday, Tolentino hit “confusing” pronouncements from the DOH, FDA and the DOST regarding the upcoming clinical trials that the country would participate in.
“Where do the duties, responsibilities, and accountabilities of the DOST, the DOH, and the FDA begin and end?” he asked, saying it should be clarified which agency is on top of the clinical trials.
The DOST leads the Interagency Task Force’s sub technical working group on vaccine development and works with the FDA on the conduct of clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines.It earlier announced that the Philippines has signed confidential data agreements (CDA) with at least seven companies on the conduct of the clinical trials in the country.
The firms were from Russia, US, Australia, Taiwan and China.
The DOH had said that an approval from the FDA and ethics review board should be secured first before the conduct of any vaccine trial.“Dapat health authorities ang may hawak kasi maselan po itong tungkol sa bakuna (Health authorities should be in charged because these vaccine trials are sensitive),” Tolentino maintained Friday.

Philippines and Russia are discussing potential manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V by Gamaleya Institute in the country, the Department of Trade and Industry revealed.
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Secretary Ramon Lopez (right) discussed with Russian Ambassador to the Philippines H.E. Igor Khovaev the possibility of manufacturing and distributing Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines during the Ambassador’s farewell courtesy call on 6 October 2020.
Trade and Industry (DTI) Secretary Ramon Lopez have discussed with Russian Ambassador to the Philippines H.E. Igor Khovaev the possibility of manufacturing and distributing Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines during the Ambassador’s farewell courtesy call Tuesday, October 6, 2020.
DTI Undersecretary Ceferino S. Rodolfo, who is also Board of Investment managing head, said that Philippines and Russia also agreed the need to strengthen the ongoing Joint Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation (JCTEC), which covers the areas of trade, investment, and other economic cooperation projects between the two nations.Rodolfo said the JCTEC is slated to meet in November this year wherein “the important part of the JTEC meeting agenda is the collaboration on vaccines.”
While Rodolfo said that the discussion was still preliminary, the discussions appeared to be already gaining ground with Russia having discussed the plan through their Manila embassy with the Department of Health and the Department of Science and Technology.
The DOST through Assistant Leah Buendia has already engaged with Russia’s Gamaleya Institute and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). Alexander Zhuravlev, senior vice-president of the investment department of RDIF has presented Gamaleya’s Sputnik V vaccine last September 18. The Russian Sputnik V is touted as the world’s first Human Adenovirus Vector-based COVID-19 vaccine.
“The offer of Russia is not only to supply vaccines, but also to collaborate for the manufacturing of the vaccine in the Philippines. Ambassador Igor emphasized that Russia is the only country who also offers in-country manufacturing of the vaccine,” said Rodolfo.DTI Assistant Secretary Allan Gepty said that Russia is willing to venture into manufacturing provided there is a pharma company that can handle full scale production of vaccines. “I think this is something that the Philippines will have to prepare or build capacity,” he said.
Gepty explained that the roadmap of the vaccine development in the Philippines is in the medium term to have a local pharma company to establish a fill and finish for the vaccine. In the long term, a virology science and technology institute has been requested to be established (currently a bill is filed in Congress) to build the capability initially for R and D and eventually to have our own full-scale vaccine manufacturing.
On the joint clinical trial, Gepty said that per Food and Drugs Administration there is an ethnicity requirement/racial similarity needed as part of the protocol in the approval process of vaccine. “Right now, most of the subjects in the clinical trial conducted are Russians,” he said.“It is important that it undergoes all related Philippine rules and regulations, including conduct of joint clinical trials,” he said.
Rodolfo likewise stressed that it is important that the vaccine undergoes all the related Philippine rules and regulations, including the conduct of joint clinical trials and follow the requirements of the DOH, Food and Drug Administration and DOST.
The plan though is part of the joint clinical trials and the immediate provision of vaccine supply after the third phase and regulatory approval that they will follow all local rules and regulations related to this e.g. conduct of joint 3rd-phase clinical trial for the Sputnik V.
During the meeting, the Russian ambassador also mentioned that aside from Gamaleya, two other entities in Russia are also developing vaccines. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the government intends to prioritize the country’s 20 million poorest Filipinos once the vaccine supply is purchased and approved for distribution.
World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier said there is hope that a coronavirus vaccine may be ready by the end of 2020. The health official also reportedly called on world leaders to commit an equitable distribution of the vaccine when it becomes available.“Naitabi na po natin ang budget para sa pagbili ng Covid-19 [vaccine]. Alam na natin ang mekanismo (We have set adie the budget for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccine. We already know the mechanism),” Roque said over state television Wednesday.Under the government plan, Roque said the Philippine International Trading Corp (PITC), a state firm attached to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), will purchase the COVID-19 vaccines. The funds for the vaccine procurement will be provided by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LandBank) and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).
“Bibili po tayo ng dosage, dalawang dosage para sa 20 million na pinakahirap nating mga kababayan. Mauuna po ang mga mahihirap (We will buy two doses for 20 million poorest countrymen. The poor will be the first beneficiaries),” he said.
President Duterte earlier said the government will buy the most affordable vaccine that will be sold in the market given its limited resources.In the distribution of free vaccines, he said the country’s poor, soldiers and policemen will get the priority.
Under the Bayanihan 2 law, the government has a standby fund of P10 billion for COVID testing and procurement of medicines and vaccines.The Department of Health (DOH) earlier said it has also earmarked an initial P2.4 billion from its proposed 2021 budget to purchase the COVID-19 vaccines when they become available.

The DOH said that 2,825 new people have been afflicted with COVID-19, raising the number of active cases across the country to 49,989. The cumulative caseload of the Philippines currently stood at 329,637.Metro Manila recorded the highest number of new cases with 1,031, followed by Cavite with 243, Batangas with 238, Bulacan with 173, and Rizal with 159.The tally of recoveries climbed to 273,723 after 437 more survivors were recorded, while the death count went up to 5,925 with 60 new fatalities.
Preparations for the Solidarity trials
In a related development, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the DOH is now preparing for the World Health Organization’s Solidarity Trials for Vaccines that is expected to start by the end of this month.“As we wait for WHO to announce the trial sites, when is really the start of the clinical trials— in parallel, we are finalizing our preparatory activities already so that when the WHO signals na mag-umpisa na tayo, we are already ready for this clinical trial,” said Vergeire in an online forum Wednesday.Aside from the country’s vaccine experts panel, Vergeire said that the government is also creating a “data safety monitoring committee.”“Ito po yung sa monitoring ng pagbabakuna para meron tayong mga eksperto para po pag sinumbmit sa kanila yung data, they can readily analyze and provide further recommendation to the implementors—sa DOH at saka local government units [This is for the monitoring of the vaccination (process) so that we have experts that can readily analyze and provide further recommendation to the implementors — to the DOH and then local government units],” she said.The DOH’s health promotion bureau is also preparing to “engage” the public with regards to this initiative.
“Napaka importante po na [It is important that] we engage the community. So that the community will be informed of this trial: what will happen, what would be the advantages, what would be the possible disadvantages or harmful effects of these vaccines and how it can benefit the community,” she said.

The US Food and Drug Administration made public its guidance for issuing emergency approval for a Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday, making it clear it wants to see follow-up two months after trial volunteers have their second dose.

It is therefore unlikely for President Donald Trump’s administration to have a vaccine on the market before the November 3 election, something the president frequently says is on the cards.
“Data from Phase 3 studies should include a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen to help provide adequate information to assess a vaccine’s benefit-risk profile,” the document said.The two companies that are furthest along in their vaccine trials, Moderna and Pfizer, both began their final stages at the end of July, and both require two separate injections 28 days apart.
That would mean that only the first few people who signed up for the trial would have completed the follow-up period by the end of October, and there would probably not be enough data to apply for emergency use.
The vaccines will have to inoculate half of all patients against Covid-19. Additionally, there will need to be at least five cases of severe infection in the placebo group to prove the vaccine is effective.
“FDA is committed to making the #COVID19 vaccine development process & our scientific evaluation as open & transparent as possible,” the agency’s head Stephen Hahn wrote on Twitter.The decision to issue the guidance comes amid a reported tug-of-war between the White House and the FDA.
According to US media outlets, the White House viewed the two-month follow-up period as unnecessary and did not want the FDA to implement it.
Trump expressed his disapproval on Twitter Tuesday night, writing: “New FDA Rules make it more difficult for them to speed up vaccines for approval before Election Day. Just another political hit job!”The news was welcomed by health experts who said it showed the agency was acting responsibly in the face of political pressure. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Conduct of the vaccine trials for the first batch of candidate vaccines from the World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to commence in the fourth week of October, the top official of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) disclosed.
DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña mentioned the update on the WHO Solidarity Trial for Vaccines during his weekly report on Friday. He said that this also includes the recruitment of volunteer vaccine recipients.
He also said that the conduct of the trial needs to pass all levels of the approval process, such as from the Vaccine Expert Panel, Ethics Review Board, and the country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to comply with the WHO protocol, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and submission of the necessary documentary requirements.“Since the aforementioned protocol and SOPs are yet to be released by the WHO, the vaccine teams are currently preparing the hospital sites and are planning the community trial sites for the smooth implementation of the said trials,” Dela Pena added.
DOST is funding the local implementation of the WHO Solidarity Trial amounting to P89.1 Million.The project’s main implementer is the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) with Dr. Jodor Lim as the overall principal investigator. There are 11 participating hospitals that will serve as trial sites of the project.On September 3, theInter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) approved through Resolution No. 68 the zoning guideline for the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials as recommended by the Sub-TWG on Vaccine Development through the assistance of the DOST Vaccine Expert Panel.
The guideline is being issued to avoid competition for clinical trial sites among vaccine developers. The DOST, as sub-TWG chair, will also form a separate Data and Safety Monitoring Committee whose role will be important in monitoring the safety of the vaccines under the WHO Solidarity Trials while the study is ongoing.A comprehensive communication plan has also been developed by the DOH Health Promotion and Communication Office with the help of DOST, Philippine Health Research Ethics Board (PHREB), PGH and other concerned agencies to inform the general public about the trials; promote transparency, cautious optimism, global cooperation, volunteerism and ownership, and ethics in relation to the upcoming clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque disclosed the President’s preference for the potential China-made vaccine even as pharmaceutical firms from other countries are also making progress in the development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus disease.
“All the vaccines are undergoing third- and final-phase clinical tests,” Roque said during a press briefing in Bataan.“The President is most hopeful with China but he has also said that Johnson and Johnson is on track,” he added.
Citing latest information, Roque also said Moderna, a pharmaceutical firm based in the United States, has also produced “very promising results” in the third phase of clinical trials of its potential vaccine.
Roque said the Philippines is likewise closely coordinating with Russian authorities on its potential COVID-19 vaccine. He noted that proposed Sputnik V vaccine will undergo third clinical trials both in Russia and the Philippines.
“Iyong sa England po nag-resume na sila, panandaliang tinigil (the England-based firmhas resumed the trials after briefly stopping the trial),” he said.According to Roque, the global race to find the coronavirus vaccine will be good for the people as the pandemic has infected more than 34.1 million across the world.
“Now alam ninyo naman po kasi ang nature ng pharmaceutical industries ‘no, nag-uunahan po iyan which is good for us ‘no.

NEW YORK, United States – The United Nations and its partners on Thursday welcomed a monumental show of solidarity as governments, private sector, civil society and international organizations committed support to the Access to COVID-19 Tools- (ACT) Accelerator initiative launched by the World Health Organization alongside international partners.
Nearly US$1 billion in new financing has been committed to the initiative – the world’s most comprehensive multilateral end-to-end solution to the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.
The ACT-Accelerator, which was co-launched by the World Health Organization, European Commission, France and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation just five months ago, needs an additional US$35 billion to realize its goals of producing 2 billion vaccine doses, 245 million treatments and 500 million tests. The new commitments to the initiative are welcome and will be leveraged to catalyze further funding to continue the ACT-Accelerator’s groundbreaking work.Most urgently, the ACT-Accelerator requires US$15 billion to support immediate capacity-building—for research and development, manufacturing, procurement and delivery systems—by the end of the year.
Convening a high-level event at the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly to urgently mobilize support for the ACT-Accelerator, Secretary-General António Guterres commended on the “extraordinary international effort to address a human crisis like no other in our lifetimes,” adding that more efforts must be made to further “deepen” the remarkable progress so far.
“It is in every country’s national and economic self-interest to work together to massively expand access to tests and treatments, and to support a vaccine as a global public good—a “people’s vaccine” available and affordable for everyone, everywhere.”
”The ACT-Accelerator—including its COVAX Facility—is the vehicle to get us there. Investing in the ACT-Accelerator will accelerate every country’s own recovery,” said Mr. Guterres who co-hosted the event with the United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, South Africa’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, and the Director-General of World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
Unprecedented Global Collaboration
The ACT-Accelerator, which was launched just five months ago, is an unprecedented global collaboration of the world’s top international health organizations working together to accelerate the development, production, and equitable delivery of COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
“We have a duty to ensure vaccines, treatments and tests for COVID-19 are available to all—stopping the global spread of the pandemic protects the British people and will put humanity on the road to recovery. Collaboration through the ACT-Accelerator is critical to promoting development, production and access for all countries,” said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.
The United Kingdom recently committed up to £571m (approximately US$ 732m) for COVAX. This includes up to £500m for the Gavi Advanced Market Commitment for COVID-19 (COVAX AMC) vaccines—a financing instrument that incentivises vaccine manufacturers to produce sufficient COVID-19 vaccines to ensure access for developing countries.
The UK Foreign Secretary called for more support, pledging that this £500m commitment would include £1 (IS$ 1.29) in matched funding for every US$4 committed by others for up to £250m (approximately US$ 321m).
Germany, Canada and Sweden have also made new commitments to the COVAX AMC of Euro 100 million, CAD$ 220 million and US$ 10 million respectively. These are eligible for matching with today’s UK matching commitment.
”Science is giving us solutions, in the form of new tests, therapeutics and­—hopefully—a vaccine. But science and solutions will be ineffective without solidarity,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“I am grateful for the generous financial commitments made today, but we still have a significant funding gap to close. Fully financing the ACT Accelerator will help to control the pandemic, restore confidence and stimulate the global recovery. Frankly, this is not a financial challenge, it’s a test of solidarity. This is a moment for saying no to nationalism and yes to our shared humanity. Because ultimately, the ACT Accelerator is not delivering merely vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. It’s delivering something far more important—hope.”
“We must confront this health crisis as a global challenge, together in solidarity and cooperation with one another, working toward a global solution. We have to generate the key tests, treatments and vaccines that we all need, and make sure they are distributed equitably to people who most need them, regardless of where they live and whether their country is wealthy or not,” said South Africa’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, adding that large parts of the population especially in developing countries remain “vulnerable and marginalized during this pandemic.”
The event highlighted the substantial results achieved by the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator initiative since its launch: the availability of 120 million affordable and high-quality rapid tests for low- and middle-income countries; a breakthrough in trials with, and a rapid rollout of, Dexamethasone—the only drug found to make a significant difference to patient mortality; the creation of the COVAX Facility – the global mechanism to ensure equitable access to eventual COVID-19 vaccines regardless of income -comprising 168 economies and the largest and most diverse vaccine portfolio in the world, with nine candidate vaccines under evaluation, eight of them in clinical trials.
In another significant show of support, a coalition of 16 pharmaceutical companies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation signed an agreement to cooperate on vaccine manufacturing and to scale up production at an unprecedented speed, ensuring that approved vaccines are more broadly accessible and distributed as early as possible.
Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said “One thing I’ve learned studying the history of pandemics is that they create a surprising dynamic when it comes to self-interest and altruism. Pandemics are rare cases where a country’s instinct to help itself is tightly aligned with its instinct to help others. The self-interested thing and the altruistic thing–making sure poor nations have access to vaccines–are one and the same.”
“A number of countries, most recently the United Kingdom and Canada, are good models for what other wealthy nations should do. They have donated enough money for COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the ACT-Accelerator, to procure, probably, hundreds of millions of vaccine doses for poor countries. But more will be needed and I hope wealthy nations will continue to be generous.”
The World Bank unveiled plans this week for a significant financial commitment to support developing countries to purchase COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they are available.
World Bank President David Malpass said that once the plans are ratified by stakeholders, “having up to US$ 12 billion available in finance will be a game changer because once a safe and effective vaccine is available, it will allow people to resume their lives with confidence.”
Investing in Global Recovery
The ACT-Accelerator Investment Case illustrates the considerable economic benefits of collectively accelerating the development and deployment of tools to rapidly reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 disease globally. Prior to UNGA 2020, the ACT-Accelerator has raised US$3 billion out of a need of US$38 billion. More detail can be found in the Act-Accelerator investment case.
The economic rationale for investing in an approach that can accelerate the end of the COVID-19 crisis remains clear. Fully financing the initiative to help shorten the duration of the crisis would pay back this investment in less than 36 hours once global mobility and trade alone are restored.

US biotech firm Moderna won’t seek an emergency use authorization for its coronavirus vaccine before November 25, its CEO told the Financial Times on Wednesday.
The news deals a blow to President Donald Trump’s hopes of having an injection ready before the election to give his campaign a much-needed boost.
Stephane Bancel told the newspaper: “November 25 is the time we will have enough safety data to be able to put into an EUA file that we would send to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) — assuming that the safety data is good, i.e. a vaccine is deemed to be safe.”Trump, whose approval has taken a hit over his handling of the Covid-19 crisis, has frequently hinted a vaccine could be ready before the November 3 vote.
This has raised concern among experts that his administration may attempt to interfere with the regulatory process for political reasons.
The Republican repeated his claim on Tuesday night, during a debate with his Democratic rival, former vice president Joe Biden.
“It’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1,” he said.Moderna’s vaccine is one of 11 experimental vaccines in final stage trials.
Another is being developed by Pfizer, whose CEO Albert Bourla has taken the position that his company may have a clear answer about whether their shot works by October.
Most experts are skeptical of the claim, believing that the ongoing trials will not have sufficient statistical data to prove the drug’s safety and effectiveness by that time.Speaking to the Washington Post on Tuesday, Bourla denied he was attempting to curry favor with the president by making his October claim.

GENEVA – Up to 100 million additional doses of any eventual COVID-19 vaccines will be secured for delivery to poorer countries in 2021, health groups announced Tuesday, as the virus showed no sign of receding after claiming more than one million lives around the world.

The announcement doubles the number of doses already secured from the Serum Institute of India by the Gavi vaccine alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, following an initial agreement last month.
The public-private health partnership stressed that the eventual total is “potentially several times” greater, and said the price would be capped at $3 per dose.
“No country, rich or poor, should be left at the back of the queue when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines; this collaboration brings us another step closer to achieving this goal,” Gavi chief Seth Berkley said.
As nine vaccine candidates are in last-stage trials, the World Bank said Tuesday it had asked its board of directors to approve $12 billion to help poor countries purchase and distribute vaccines.
A World Bank spokesman said that “the global economy will not recover fully until people feel they can live, socialize, work and travel with confidence.”
As humanity struggles against COVID-19, the World Health Organization said this week that some 120 million rapid tests will soon be made available to low- and middle-income countries if funding can be secured.
The kits — faster, cheaper and easier to administer than standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests, but also less reliable — will be rolled out across 133 countries in the next six months.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday said that “responsible leadership matters” in steering the world through the pandemic.
“Science matters. Cooperation matters — and misinformation kills,” he warned, urging people to respect familiar infection control measures like hand-washing, distancing and mask-wearing.
Case numbers are climbing rapidly in Europe, where governments are clamping down on movement in an attempt to curb the surge.
Germany introduced new limits on the number of people who can attend private events, after Spain, France, Britain and Northern Ireland all imposed fresh restrictions.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ”a reaction is necessary” after recent outbreaks were frequently traced to weddings and other gatherings.
In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to share general confusion about his government’s measures, apologizing after wrongly saying that rules limiting gatherings in northeast England to no more than six people did not apply outdoors.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia said they were preparing to declare a state of emergency.
In Israel, which has the world’s highest infection rate per capita, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said Tuesday that there was ”no way” the country’s second nationwide coronavirus lockdown would be lifted after three weeks as originally planned. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Christopher “Bong” Go on Wednesday urged the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) to make sure the COVID-19 vaccines to be used in the clinical trials in the country are safe.Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go
(OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“I implore the DOST, as the lead agency in charge of the clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines in Metro Manila, CALABARZON, and Cebu, to ensure that the vaccine trials are expedited but still in accordance with applicable scientific standards,” Go said
“Please make sure that the vaccine is safe. ‘Yun lang po ang importante para po hindi matakot ang ating mga kababayan. Siguraduhin natin na safe ang mga vaccine na nasa trial stages na po sa ngayon,” he added. (It is important that we dispel the doubts or fears of our countrymen. Let us make sure that these vaccines are safe as they are now in the final stages of trials.) 
The DOST had earlier said that the World Health Organization’s Solidarity Trial of potential COVID-19 vaccines will likely start in December.
According to DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña, once WHO releases the vaccines and protocols, the Philippines can then begin recruiting patients to participate in the trials which will likely be in October.
Meanwhile, Go expressed his support for the proposed budgets of the DOST and the Philippine Space Agency (PSA).
“I express my support for the budget of the Department of Science and Technology and the Philippine Space Agency,” Go said.“I especially laud the department, led by its very hardworking Secretary Fortunato dela Peña, in striving to continuously improve our efforts in research and development in science and technology. With your efforts, together with the rest of the government, we will overcome this crisis,” he said.
Go also recognized the achievements the science and technology department has attained recently. In the Global Innovation Index 2020, the Philippines rose from 100th in 2014 to 50th this year.
“It is a symbol of hope for the country that is currently fighting the pandemic. Indeed, hard work and the constant pursuit of excellence do pay off. But let us not be complacent,’’ he said.Go noted that the country, through its science and research arm, “can still improve, and we should. We, in the Legislative Branch, are behind you and will do our part to help.”
On the country’s venture towards becoming a space-capable nation, Go also expressed his excitement over the country’s push for PhilSA.“I also take this opportunity to express my excitement over the country’s first real push into becoming a space-capable and space-faring nation within the next decade, as embodied in the Philippine Space Act,” Go said.
The PhilSA was formed after the Philippine Space Act was passed into law in July last year. One of its main policies is to safeguard Philippine sovereignty, territorial integrity, Philippine interest, and the right to self-determination as mandated by Article II, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution. It also intends to support and commit to the development, application, and utilization of science and technology that will foster patriotism and nationalism and accelerate social progress, such as the development of space technology and applications for its security and for the benefit of its citizens.
“Every great nation has the goal of seizing the space frontier and I am happy to see the country take its first steps toward the realization of this lofty goal,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña, in his weekly report, said preparations discussed by the teams include the creation of a timeline of activities for COVID-19 vaccine trials campaign, data sharing arrangements, and laboratory procedure(s) for sample collection, processing, and cryopreservation, which was sent by the WHO-Philippines.
In an online forum with DOH on Friday, the secretary said that the WHO may release the list of vaccines and protocols for the Solidarity trial for Vaccines by next month.DOST is funding the local implementation of the P89.1-million WHO Solidarity Trial.
The project’s main implementor is the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) with Dr. Jodor Lim as the overall principal investigator. Eleven hospitals will serve as trial sites of the project.
On September 3, the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) approved through Resolution No. 68 the zoning guideline for the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials as recommended by the Sub-TWG on Vaccine Development through the assistance of the DOST Vaccine Expert Panel.
The guideline is being issued to avoid competition for clinical trial sites among vaccine developers. The DOST, as sub-TWG chair, will also form a separate Data and Safety Monitoring Committee whose role will be important in monitoring the safety of the vaccines under the WHO Solidarity Trials while the study is ongoing.A comprehensive communication plan has also been developed by the DOH Health Promotion and Communication Office with the help of DOST, Philippine Health Research Ethics Board (PHREB), PGH and other concerned agencies to inform the general public about the trials; promote transparency, cautious optimism, global cooperation, volunteerism and ownership, and ethics in relation to the upcoming clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines.

“The best case scenario, if clinical trials are completed by December or January, and a company would file an application with FDA, it’s possible that by April, 2021, we will have an approved vaccine,” said FDA Director General Rolando Enrique Domingo in an online forum on Friday.
“Talagang best case scenario yun [That’s the best case scenario], meaning yung three to six months (of clinical trials), magiging three months; assuming that they will complete all their analysis and submit immediately to FDA,” he added.Domingo noted that the approval of a vaccine really depends on the completion of the phase 3 clinical trials.
“Once completed, they can start the registration process with the FDA. This is of course not limited to vaccines that will undergo phase 3 clinical trials here. It is possible that some vaccines will not go to the Philippines for phase 3 but will also register. At the earliest, ang nakikita natin na merong may matatapos na phase 3 clinical trial is December this year,” said the FDA chief.
“That means, there’s a possibility that by the end of the year or toward the first quarter next year, we already have applicants for registration. Like I said, we will give it about 45 to 60 days, depending of course on the approval that they get from their own country or WHO (World Health Organization),” he added.
WHO Solidarity trial for Vaccines
Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Secretary Fortunato Dela Pena said that the WHO may release the list of vaccines and protocols for the Solidarity trial for Vaccines by next month.“Vaccine recipients under the WHO solidarity trial will be recruited from five to 10 barangays reporting high COVID cases. This is important because we want to test for the efficacy of the vaccine and we will do it in places where there is a high occurrence or attack rate,” said Dela Pena.
He added that the solidarity vaccine trials will be “led by the Philippine General Hospital as the main implementer and there are 12 hospitals that have been chosen as trial sites” for this initiative.
“We are now in the process of finalizing the memorandum of agreement between the DOST and DILG because this is very important in the conduct and in the implementation of the zoning guidelines,” he added.
Negotiations with vaccine developersOn top of the WHO Solidarity Trial, the country is also having discussions with other international vaccine developers, said Dela Pena.
The DOST chief said that the government is currently having negotiations with 17 vaccine developers from China, the United States of America, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Russia, and India.
“We’re approaching these countries to find out what is the status of their vaccine and whether they are willing to enter into a partnership with us in one form or another either through trials or through manufacture in our country,” he said.
Out of the 17, six have already signed “confidentiality disclosure agreements (CDA).”
“Meaning to say, because of their interest to do the clinical trials in the Philippines, they are willing to show us their data and information on the results of their trials in their country, particularly in the phases that they completed,” said Dela Pena. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Withholding the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine — the most effective means of mass salvation — is a weapon of mass destruction, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said on Tuesday.Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. (PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Locsin made this point in a speech during the virtual High-Level Meeting commemorating the 75th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting where he raised concerns about making the universal accessibility to potential COVID vaccines without preconditions.“You know decency when you see it; it is indecent when you don’t. A case soon to be made in point will be the universal availability of COVID vaccines without requiring any people, class or country to submit to another’s will as the price of cure,” the country’s top diplomat said.
He noted that the UN, being the only globally credible platform, remains the essential organization as the world is grappling to fight the pandemic.While Locsin renewed the country’s commitment to the multilateral body, he, however, cautioned that multilateralism “cannot be owned by select member states, let alone one.”
“It is by and for all — or no one. COVID-19 reminds us of humanity’s common fate, the perishability of life, progress and social order, and of the imperative of coordinated international action even in concerns we’d always regarded as too small to bother the world with. The virus is tiny,” he said.Moreover, the foreign affairs chief pointed out that the UN is the “core of the present multilateral global order and must stay that way.”
“As long as the UN exists, none can trumpet the end of multilateralism. But it must be a UN strengthened in its every member; so that together they can achieve peace, democracy and prosperity in a world where every state is accountable for the consequences of its action or inaction; where any of “we, the peoples…” can put up a credible fight long enough to make our case for UN help,” Locsin said.Last week, President Duterte vowed to prioritize procuring COVID-19 vaccine from Russia or China, while criticizing pharmaceutical firms of western nations for reportedly asking for advance payment for their offers.

(MANILA BULLETIN)
After Robredo criticized the government’s pandemic response, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque challenged the Vice President to come up with a plan to resolve the pandemic that will not depend on the development of a vaccine.
“Hinahamon ko po si VP Leni, kung mayroon siyang solusyon na walang vaccine at wala pa ring gamot, sabihin po niya, dahil sigurado po baka ngayon din maging Presidente siya kung makahanap siya ng solusyon habang walang bakuna at walang gamot (I am challenging VP Leni. If she has a solution that does not need a vaccine and a cure, tell us. Because I’m sure she might immediately become the president if she can present a solution while there is no vaccine and cure),” he said during a televised press briefing.Robredo earlier declared that the President’s plan to wait for the coronavirus vaccine to effectively address the pandemic was not enough.She instead proposed that medical and non-medical measures should be pursued to suppress the pandemic in the country. She said the pandemic cannot be resolved by spraying pesticides from an airplane as suggested by President.
The pandemic response, she added, should involve overcoming humanitarian emergencies including poverty, hunger, unemployment, mental distress, and other COVID-19 related problems; restructuring public and private finances; and rebuilding an inclusive, resilient and sustainable economy.
Roque, however, asked Robredo and the rest of the opposition bloc to open their “eyes and ears” to the government’s improved efforts to address the pandemic. He said they have apparently ignored the improved testing, tracing and treatment efforts made by the government.“Wala raw tayong ginagawa. Well, sila lang ‘ata ang hindi nakakaalam kung anong ginagawa ng gobyerno. Buksan po ang mga mata at buksan po ang mga pandinig (We are supposedly doing nothing. Well, it seems they are the only ones who don’t know what the government is doing. Better open your eyes and ears),” he said.
In his televised address Monday night, the President hit back at Robredo and other “dilawan” critics for allegedly making “reckless statements” that the government was not doing enough to address the pandemic. Duterte said he did not know what the critics still wanted from the government, citing efforts that have already enhanced country’s healthcare capacity.
“They are trying to delude people about — they are trying to picture that there is a failure of government. We have done our best. We have responded to the medical needs,” he said. “We are surviving and we are only waiting for the vaccine,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

GENEVA – More than 60 wealthy nations have joined a WHO backed program to facilitate poor countries’ access to coronavirus vaccines, but the US and China are not on the list published Monday.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has in coordination with the global vaccine alliance group Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) created a mechanism aimed at ensuring a more equitable distribution of any future Covid-19 vaccines.
But the mechanism, known as Covax, has struggled to raise the funds needed to provide for the 92 low-income countries and other economies that quickly signed up.WHO had encouraged richer nations to step up to the plate by the end of last week and when the deadline fell, 64 were onboard with another 38 expected to join in “coming days”, the three organizations said in a joint statement.
Among those who have signed up are “the European Commission … on behalf of 27 EU member states plus Norway and Iceland,” it said.
The United States, which under President Donald Trump has relentlessly criticised the WHO’s handling of the pandemic and which is in the process of withdrawing from the organization, is not on the list.
And China, where the novel coronavirus first surfaced late last year, is also absent.“The purpose of the Covax facility is to try to work with every country in the world,” Gavi chief Seth Berkley told a virtual briefing when asked about China’s absence from the list.
“I can assure you that we have had conversations and will continue to have conversations with all countries,” he said.
‘Not charity’In addition to working to get more countries to join Covax, Berkley said there was also an ongoing dialogue with vaccine-producing countries about “’if they have successful vaccines that come out, how we can make sure they are made available to others in the world.”
The aim is for Covax to lay its hands on two billion doses of safe and effective vaccines by the end of 2021. But the mechanism is facing a range of significant challenges, not least a serious funding shortfall.
The WHO has said some $38 billion is needed for its overall ACTAccelerator program, which includes Covax, but also global collaboration towards developing and ensuring equitable access to tests and treatments for COVID-19, and strengthening health systems. But so far it has received just $3.0 billion of that.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus voiced optimism that so many countries – representing nearly two-thirds of the global population – had agreed to participate in the mechanism.
“COVID-19 is an unprecedented global crisis that demands an unprecedented global response,” he said in the statement, warning countries against scrambling to acquire vaccine stocks for their populations alone.“Vaccine nationalism will only perpetuate the disease and prolong the global recovery,” he said.
“This is not charity,” he told journalists. “It’s in every country’s best interest. We sink or we swim together.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The country and the Russian Embassy recently discussed the regulatory process and the conduct of a clinical trial for Sputnik V, which is scheduled to start soon, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said.
“One of our requests to them is the clinical trial protocol that we are waiting for before our vaccine experts panel starts its study for the conduct of clinical trial for Sputnik V,” Vergeire said.“Nagkaroon ng magandang (There was a good) response and they committed to us that they will follow up so the clinical trial protocol will immediately be submitted to the Philippines so that we can start the evaluation by our vaccine experts panel,” Vergeire added.
The regulatory process of the Russian-developed vaccine is also included in the discussion, the Health official furthered.
It was disclosed that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also committed to shorten the process from vaccine experts panel review to ethical clearance to FDA review and evaluation.
From 55 days, the FDA committed to reduce the process to about 43 days maximum once the requirements are complete.“We offered them (Russian Embassy) if we can do parallel, meaning they give us the documents needed to be studied by the vaccine experts panel so that when the formal protocol for this clinical trial is submitted, we can already start the regulatory process,” Vergeire said.
The undersecretary said the meeting with the Russian Embassy “went well.”

The numbers related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are alarming: about 29 million cases around the world with a death toll of 917,000, according to the World Health Organization, as of Sept. 14.Add to that the WHO also recorded 307,930 new cases in 24 hours around the world, the highest number of new cases so far.
(JANSEN ROMERO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
As the numbers continue to rise, scientists and researchers around the world are working tirelessly to produce a vaccine, many of them now in the final stages of the clinical trials.
What is the process of getting the clinical trials conducted, how are participants selected, and what happens during the period of the clinical trials?Here’s a look at the processes now ongoing in the Philippines and in many parts of the world on the way to producing a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19.
First, approval from the FDAAll candidate vaccines must undergo a regulatory process before it can be tested in the country.
DOH Undersecretary Mario Rosario Vergerie said approval from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and ethics review board must be secured first before the conduct of any vaccine trial whether by local or international sponsors or developers.
“The government needs to regulate [these initiatives] so that we can ensure that it will be safe for our countrymen. If we do not go through this process, we cannot be sure that it is safe and it might cause harm to our citizens,” Vergerie said in Pilipino.
The approval of a trial application would take 45 to 60 days, Jesusa Joyce Cirunay, head of FDA’s Center for Drug Regulation and Research, said.
Recruiting volunteersDr. Jaime Montoya an infectious disease expert and Executive Director of the DOST – Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD) explained the system for the recruitment of volunteers for clinical trials.He said that is based on selection criteria related to the protocols set by the vaccine developers.That also serves as a guide to the characteristics of volunteers who will participate.
“Meron silang mga target na age groups, puwede din kasing makita doon kung anong mga klase ng tao ang kanilang target, halimbawa pwedeng healthcare workers, mga frontliners, mga nagtatrabaho sa ospital o pwedeng mga nasa komunidad (They have a target age group, or the type of persons required — if a healthcare worker, frontliner, hospital worker or just a person within a community),” Montoya explained.
He explained that what is important is that selection is not at random.
It is also important that there should be an informed consent (FPIC).
“Ipapaliwanag sa mga lalahok kung ano yung clinical trial, yung ano yung produkto, ano yung posibleng epekto nito, bakit ito ibinibigay, at ano iyong maaaring mangyari kapag ika’y lumahok (It is explained to the participants what the clinical trial is about, the product, possible effects, the reason why it is given, and what will happen during the trials),” Montoya said.
Montoya emphasized that participation in the clinical trials is voluntary. If they agree, they sign and join.
Compensation
Are volunteers compensated for joining the clinical trials? Dr. Montoya said that they are given a small amount for food and in some cases transportation when they need to go to an area far from their residences.“But we need to keep in mind that this amount is not huge. This is to avoid people from taking part without fully understanding the meaning behind their participation and may only be doing it because of the money,” Montoya explained.
“That’s what we call, “undue inducement” and we don’t want that to happen,” Montoya said.
The clinical trials
Dr. Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination said that the people involved in the trials will be monitored from the time they are given the vaccine up to five years after, depending on safety concerns.“There is a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) overlooking the trial and they can stop the trial anytime if there are concerns, or continue the trial after certain numbers have been enrolled,” Dr. Bravo said.
The World Health Organization Solidarity Trials, which has yet to announce the vaccines to be used, will run for 18 months while the Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Sputnik V, the Russian vaccine, will run for three to six months.
The Solidarity Trials and the Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Sputnik are different in method and scope.According to Department of Science and Technology Secretary Fortunato dela Pena, an estimated 1,000 participants are required for the WHO Solidarity trials since about 80 countries will be part of it. The Philippines is participating in the Solidarity trials.
Sputnik, the Russian vaccine candidate, will be conducting Phase 3 clinical trials to test efficacy and monitor adverse reactions. There will be about 1,000 Filipinos who will be part of the Phase 3 clinical trials.
Dr. Bravo, who has been part of conducting vaccine trials in the country for 30 years, said that there had been no case of a participant who died during a vaccine trial.
“There is always a liability clause in the informed consent that every volunteer signs before the trial…there is insurance… dependent on DALY and age etc,” Dr. Bravo said. (Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) is the computed amount of life years and income a person loses if he becomes disabled.)
“People who have been in vaccine trials usually ask when the next one will be so they can get their friends and family included. In other words they’re happy that they were taken care of and given top quality care during the conduct of the trials,” she added.
Foreign policies on clinical trials
China is currently testing 16 different vaccine candidates, according to data from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Following China is the United States with 11 ongoing trials, and Russia with six.
According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)’s ClinRegs’s website, clinical trials in China a vaccine trial must first undergo a regulatory authority and ethics committee review before they are conducted.
A clinical trial approval in China takes 60 business days, according to the Backer McKenzie Clinical Trials Handbook (Asia Pacific).
In the United States, regulation of vaccines is done by the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. All sponsors of new vaccines in the US must undergo a “multi-step approval process.”
“Also included are information about the vaccine’s safety and ability to elicit a protective immune response in animal testing, as well as the proposed clinical protocol for studies in humans,” the US FDA said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Only 20 percent of the P12.9 billion needed to purchase vaccines against COVID-19 has been included in the proposed operational budget of the Department of Health (DOH) next year.
Health Assistant Secretary Maria Vergeire (Facebook)
DOH officials made this revelation even as clinical trials for the vaccine endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO)for the Solidarity trials are expected to start next month.In the budget hearing for the P127 billion proposed 2021 allocation for DOH, Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire said WHO is expected to announce within September the areas where clinical trials will be conducted.“WHO ang pipili ng ilan sa mga bakuna na nasa advance stages at isasama sa clinical trials.Baka makapag-umpisa na ang clinical trials ng WHO bago matapos and October (WHO will choose certain vaccines in advance stages that will be included in the clinical trials.Its possible WHO clinical trials will start before the end of October),” Vergeire told members of the House Committee on Appropriations yesterday.But while the Philippines is assured access to the successful Solidarity trial vaccine, it might resort to borrowing money to be able to purchase enough to protect Filipinos against COVID 19.Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje admitted that only P2.5 million has been allocated for the purpose, even while a minimum P12.9 million may be needed for the vaccination program.Cabotaje said this will prompt government to resort to loans to be able to cover the cash shortage for the vaccine.“Uutang po sa Landbank, the purchase will be made by PITC-Pharmaceutical under DTI (Departmnt of Trade)” the health official said.
To repay the loans, government will allocate loan servicing allocation in the proposed DOH budget in the coming years.’Aside from problems on the availability of money to purchase anti-COVID 19 vaccines, Philippines, being a small nation, faces the prospect of losing out in the scramble for limited vaccine supplies.Oxfam, a non-government organization, disclosed that wealthy nations have already been assured of getting more than 50 percent of the estimated vaccine production next year.“What will be produced next year, may not be able to meet global demands,” Cabotaje said.
Thus, whatever vaccine the Philippine may acquire will be injected first to medical frontliners. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The vaccine race has become deeply politicized in the US in the run-up to the presidential election in November, as President Donald Trump touts a quick vaccine in response to criticism of his handling of the pandemic.“I don’t trust Donald Trump,” his rival from the Democratic party Joe Biden said Wednesday. Moderna’s CEO Stephane Bancel said on Thursday his company would know whether their vaccine works by November.October is possible but unlikely, he told CNBC.The trial protocol published Thursday, which runs to 135 pages and is marked “confidential,” fixes the parameters of the experiment.
The most important of these is how it will judge whether results are conclusive.Wait for it The reality of an immunization trial is that it’s necessary to wait until a certain number of volunteers become naturally infected, in order to compare outcomes in the placebo group against the group given the vaccine.So the decline in the rate of infection in the US could theoretically delay the results – possibly until December, said Bancel.
As of Thursday, Moderna had recruited 25,296 volunteers.Among them, 10,025 had received their second dose, 28 days after the first.It’ll take a few more weeks to recruit the full quotient of 30,000 participants and for them to receive their second doses.Only COVID-19 infections recorded two weeks or more after the second dose are counted, to give the vaccine sufficient time to take effect.Interim analyses by a committee of independent experts are planned over the course of the trial to verify whether a high statistical threshold of effectiveness has been reached, and to monitor for serious side effects.
The FDA has stated its bar for approval is a vaccine that reduces the risk of falling sick with COVID-19 by 50 percent.The Moderna trial protocol “has the key information (for) stopping rules, interim analyses and efficacy assumptions.Applaud their transparency,” Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute and one of the critics leading the charge against possible political interference, told AFP.Pressure on Moderna also said that 28 percent of its participants were from racial minority groups.Having sufficient participants among black and Hispanic people in particular is crucial in obtaining statistically representative results for these communities that have been disproportionately hit by the pandemic.The decision by Moderna, which has received $2.5 billion in US government money, left a spotlight on Pfizer, whose CEO has repeatedly said the company will have its results by the end of October, which is in line with Trump’s wishes.A spokeswoman told AFP Pfizer has traditionally not shared the full in-depth study protocol, but “the COVID-19 pandemic is a unique circumstance and the need for transparency is clear.”“As a result, the company is making the full protocol for its self-funded COVID-19 vaccine pivotal study available to reinforce Pfizer’s longstanding commitment to scientific and regulatory rigor that benefits patients.”The other frontrunner is AstraZeneca, which has codeveloped a vaccine with the University of Oxford.The medicine’s global trials were suspended last week after a participant had an unexplained illness, but were later restarted in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa.The US remains the exception for reasons that aren’t yet known.

A group of wealthy nations representing 13 percent of the global population have already bought up more than half of the promised doses of future Covid-19 vaccines, according to a report by Oxfam on Wednesday.
The non-governmental organization analyzed deals struck by pharmaceuticals and vaccine producers for the five leading vaccine candidates currently in late-stage trials, based on data collected by the analytics company Airfinity.
“Access to a life-saving vaccine shouldn’t depend on where you live or how much money you have,” said Robert Silverman of Oxfam America.
“The development and approval of a safe and effective vaccine is crucial, but equally important is making sure the vaccines are available and affordable to everyone. Covid-19 anywhere is Covid-19 everywhere.”
The five vaccines analyzed were from AstraZeneca, Gamaleya/Sputnik, Moderna, Pfizer and Sinovac.
Oxfam calculated the combined production capacity of these five vaccine candidates at 5.9 billion doses, enough for three billion people given that all five future vaccines will or are highly likely to require two doses.Supply deals have so far been agreed for 5.3 billion doses, of which 2.7 billion (51 percent) have been bought by developed countries, territories and regions, including the US, UK, European Union, Australia, Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, Switzerland and Israel.
The remaining 2.6 billion doses have been bought by or promised to developing countries including India, Bangladesh, China, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico, among others.
The non-profit added that one of the leading candidates, developed by Moderna, has received $2.5 billion in committed taxpayers’ money, but has said it intends to make a profit and has sold the options for all its supply to rich nations.
Oxfam and other organizations are therefore calling for a “people’s vaccine” free of charge, distributed fairly based on need.
“This will only be possible if pharmaceutical corporations allow vaccines to be produced as widely as possible by freely sharing their knowledge free of patents, instead of protecting their monopolies and selling to the highest bidder,” Oxfam said.
It added that the estimated cost of providing a vaccine for everyone on Earth was less than one percent of the projected cost of Covid-19 to the global economy.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A China-developed coronavirus vaccine could be ready for the public as early as November, a Chinese official has told state television, as the global race to clear the final round of trials heats up.
Chinese manufacturers have been bullish about development, with companies Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm even putting their vaccine candidates on display at a trade fair in Beijing this month.
Representatives of the firms told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that they hope their vaccines will be approved after phase 3 trials as early as year-end.And on late Monday, September 14, the chief biosafety expert at the Chinese Center for Disease Control told state broadcaster CCTV that a vaccine would be available to the general public “around November or December.”
Wu Guizhen did not specify which vaccine she was referring to, but said “based on the phase 3 clinical results, the current progress is very smooth.”
Wu added that she had taken a vaccine in April and has felt good over the past few months, although she did not specify which candidate she had taken.
There are currently 9 vaccine candidates in late-stage human trials, although some have hit recent obstacles – pharma giant AstraZeneca and Oxford University momentarily paused clinical trials last week after a volunteer developed an unexplained illness.Some of China’s vaccine candidates have already been offered to essential workers under an emergency use program.
A Sinovac spokesman told AFP this month that “tens of thousands” of people had voluntarily taken its vaccine, including 90% of its employees and their families – between 2,000 and 3,000 people.
In June, China’s military approved a vaccine for use within its ranks developed by its research unit and a biotech firm.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“You must be crazy.”
President Duterte will not spend a single peso to pay a “reservation fee” to pharmaceutical companies that have yet to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, saying it is against the country’s procurement laws.
President Rodrigo Roa Duterte talks to the people after holding a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) core members at the Malago Clubhouse in Malacañang on September 14, 2020. ACE MORANDANTE/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO
In his public address on Monday evening, President Duterte claimed there are pharmaceuticalfirms that want buyers to finance their vaccine research and development efforts.“In other countries, they want cash advance bago tayo deliver-an ng vaccine. Eh kung ganun, patay tayong lahat (before they give us vaccines. If that’s the case then we will all die). Every Filipino will die I can assure you,” he said.
“Kung wala tayong ibigay sa kanila cash advance, eh di walang vaccine. Eh walang vaccine, di maghalikan na lang tayong lahat para mas madali. (If we can’t give cash advance, then we won’t have a vaccine. Let’s just kiss each other and get this over with then),” he added.
According to Duterte, even if these pharmaceutical companies that he refused to name were already in the advanced stage of their clinical trials, he cannot pay the reservation fee because it is against Philippine laws.
He said these companies must be “crazy” if they think the Philippines will just pay for something that is not certain.“There is nothing with finality, and you want us to make a reservation by depositing money? You must be crazy,” the President said.
“The procurement law of the Philippines, this country, does not allow you to buy something which is non-existent or to-be-produced as yet. It’s a very exacting law and you must always reckon with, you know, prosecution and going to jail,” he added.
President Duterte said such companies are not welcome in the Philippines because they are just looking for someone who will finance their research and development activities.“Kita’y mugasto sa ilang pag-imbento ug pagtrabaho sa ilang vaccine. Mupalit unya ko sa ila, itusok nako ang vaccine sa ilang utok kay mga gago ang mga buang (They want us to finance their experiment and development of their vaccine. I will buy the vaccine from them and inject it into their brains because they are crazy),” he said.
“Better get out of this country, we don’t need you,” he added.
Preference to China, Russia
According to President Duterte, the Philippines will give preference to China and Russia’s COVID-19 vaccines as they extended a helping hand to the Philippines during the pandemic.
“If the vaccine of Russia and China are equally good and effective, just like any other vaccine invented by any country, I will buy first,” he said.
“Noong naghirap tayo (When we were having a hard time) and there was nothing at all in sight… The only countries that offered to help initially and said, ‘Do not worry when we invent one, we’d give you,’ was Russia [and] then China,” he added.
Duterte, in particular, praised China for volunteering to help the Philippines in the fight against the respiratory illness.
“One good thing about China is you do not have to beg, you do not have to plead,” he said.
President Duterte announced last week that the Philippines will buy from the country that will offer the cheapest vaccine against COVID-19, saying all of these have the same effect any way and that funds are already tight.
He likewise said last month that the Philippines may enjoy a COVID-19-free Christmas after he accepted Russia’s vaccine offer. The Philippine government decided to do its own tests on Russia’s Sputnik V and do the Stage III trials simultaneously with Moscow, which will fund it.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that WHO has already informed the country’s sub-technical working group for vaccine development on the timeline for this global initiative.
Vergeire said that in the third to fourth week of September, the WHO is set to identify the candidate vaccines that will be included in the “solidarity” trial.“Sa ngayon kasi may mga pinagpipilian sila na listahan which are about 34 na mga bakuna na pinagpipilian. Of course they will be reducing this, kung ano lang ang karapat dapat iyon ang isasama nila [Right now, they have a list which is about 34 vaccines to choose from. Of course they will still be reducing this],” she said.
By the end of this month, the WHO team will identify sites where the trials will be conducted.
Vergeire said that they will coordinate first with the local government officials and other stakeholders with regards to the start of the trial.
“Alam natin this is voluntary so kailangan may mga informed consent din tayong kukunin. If they would be refusing. So ‘yun ang ating pag-usapan with the DILG (Department of Interior and Local Government) [We know this is voluntary so we also need to get informed consent, if they would be refusing. So we will be discussing this together with the DILG],” she said.“Kailangan ma engage muna natin ang community.

We need to talk also to local government officials]…We can explain to them the advantages and the adverse effects of these specific vaccines bago natin umpisahan ito [before we start this],” she added.
The DOH, however, noted that the timeline is still subject to change “depending on several factors and it is the WHO that will determine adjustments and changes.”
In a related development, the country’s vaccine experts panel is still in talks with other vaccine developers.“As to the Gamaleya Institute (of Russia), itong [this] Sputnik V, they have already submitted their documents to us. We were able to review it, the vaccine experts panel– at ipinasa na rin natin sa kanila ang ating mga komento [and we already gave our comments].

Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario S. Vergeire (PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“We have had discussions already with manufacturers from the US; no conditions were provided or given para sa atin,” said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
The DOH official made the response when asked about the recent statement of Malacanang Spokesperson Harry Roque, that President Duterte may have granted absolute pardon to US Marine Joseph Scott Pemberton for the country to secure access to vaccines being developed in the US.“Hindi po tayo naka-receive ng kahit anong condition na ganito [We have not received any condition like this], based from the discussions that we have had with the manufacturers from US,” said Vergeire.
Vergeire also assured that vaccines entering the Philippines would undergo the required regulatory process.
“Katulad ng lagi namin sinasabi, lahat ng bakuna na papasok dito para masiguro natin na safe yan at para masiguro na magiging epektibo iyan against COVID-19, and will benefit the population —have to go through our regulatory process [As we always say, all vaccines—to make sure they are safe and effective against COVID-19, and will benefit the population–have to go through our regulatory process],” she said.
Pemberton was convicted for homicide in 2015 after he killed Filipino transgender Jennifer Laude. He was sentenced to 10-year-imprisonment.

Hundreds of senior citizens were given free flu vaccine shots by the Manila Health Department (MHD) at the Manila City Hall.(MANILA HEALTH DEPARTMENT/ MANILA BULLETIN)
The MHD conducted the vaccination drive from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursday and Friday.
Around 300 senior citizens were vaccinated on Thursday, the MHD said.
(MANILA HEALTH DEPARTMENT/ MANILA BULLETIN)Senior citizens were prioritized as they are more at risk at suffering from severe symptoms of COVID-19, the local health department said.
Health experts have been encouraging the public to get flu vaccine as it prevents the development of symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, body aches, fatigue, and sore throat.It would also help in lessening the public’s “unnecessary anxiety” or fear of contracting the deadly disease.“Although the flu vaccine cannot prevent COVID-19, it can still help protect even the most vulnerable against complications from the disease, making it a beneficial option one can take advantage of to keep ourselves health,” the MHD said in a statement.

The University of Oxford’s vaccine is in large trials in Brazil, Britain, and South Africa. In the US, researchers just began enrolling around 30,000 volunteers to test Moderna’s vaccine, and more trials are starting every day.
At the rate researchers are working on their projects, a number of these vaccines will almost certainly beat the record for speed of development. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years. Work on the candidate Covid-19 vaccines started in January and there is a good chance at least one may be available for mass immunization before the yearend. That’s less than a year. If all goes well, at least two others may be ready in 2021.
The steps in producing a vaccineVaccine development is a complex and painstaking multi-stage process. It starts with identifying the antigens (parts or weakened strains of a virus) that will be incorporated in the vaccine. Then, tissue-culture or cell-culture and animal testing are done to find out if the vaccine produces immunity.
Three stages of clinical testing follow. Phase I entails testing for safety and immunogenicity in normal adults (less than 100 people); phase II entails testing for immunogenicity and safety in special populations (hundreds of human subjects), while phase III, which include thousands of test subjects, continues to measure the safety (rare side effects sometimes don’t appear in small groups) and effectiveness of the candidate vaccine.
If the vaccine passes the clinical trials, it is submitted for regulatory review and approval.It is only after it is approved by regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA) is a vaccine manufactured. There are some reasons why vaccine development for Covid has gone faster than usual. For one, researchers did not start from scratch. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a relative of the SARS and MERS viruses, and the work that has already been done on the development of a vaccine for these two infections has been used in the development of the Covid-19 vaccines.Also, some governments, notably the US and UK, have sped up the process by infusing billions of dollars into the vaccine projects.
Some research centers meanwhile have accelerated their work by combining phases. Some coronavirus vaccines are now in Phase I and II trials, for example.
The frontrunnersCurrently, more than 20 candidate vaccines are in the clinical trial stage, three are already in phase III.
The vaccine that the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca are jointly developing has started phase III trials in England, Brazil, and South Africa. The project may deliver a vaccine by October. AstraZeneca said their total manufacturing capacity stands at two billion doses.
In China, the state-owned company Sinopharm has reached an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to start phase III testing of its vaccine in the Gulf state. In Australia, the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute is conducting a Phase III trial on the re-purposed Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine to find out if the vaccine partly protects against the coronavirus. The BCG vaccine was developed in the early 1900s as a protection against tuberculosis.
Of those in Phase II trials, the American Company, Moderna, will start Phase III testing in July and hopes to have a vaccine ready by early 2021. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Clinical trials in Brazil of a Chinese-made vaccine against Covid-19 have shown “extremely positive” results, and a widespread vaccination campaign could begin as early as December, the governor of Sao Paulo state said Wednesday.
Sao Paulo, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in hard-hit Brazil, is one of six states helping to test the so-called CoronaVac vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech.
The vaccine produced an immune response in 98 percent of recipients over 60 years old, with no adverse side-effects reported so far, said Governor Joao Doria.“The results have been extremely positive,” he told a news conference.
“We will soon be able to immunize Brazilians in Sao Paulo and across the country with the CoronaVac vaccine…. The projected delivery date is in December this year.”
Sinovac has partnered with a Brazilian public health research center, the Butantan Institute, to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials of the vaccine — the last step before regulatory approval.
The deal gives the institute the right to produce 120 million doses of the vaccine, according to officials.CoronaVac has gotten caught up in a political battle in Brazil, however.
President Jair Bolsonaro, whose administration has tense relations with China, has criticized the vaccine, and lashed out at Doria, a leading opponent, for supposedly backing it.
The far-right president has instead allocated 1.9 billion reals ($360 million) to purchase another vaccine candidate, developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.Trials of that vaccine, which is also being tested partly in Brazil, were suspended Tuesday after a volunteer recipient developed an unexplained illness — a move the company described as “routine.”
Brazil has the second-highest death toll in the pandemic after the United States, with more than 127,000 people killed and 4.1 million infections.
The South American country has emerged as a leading testing ground for vaccines.
In the latest development, Brazilian medical diagnostics company Dasa and US vaccine-maker COVAXX announced a deal Wednesday to conduct Phase 2 and 3 trials of the latter’s Covid-19 vaccine in Brazil.
COVAXX, a subsidiary of US firm United Biomedical, plans to test the vaccine on at least 3,000 volunteers in Brazil. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In a statement, Huang said the UAE trial is the world’s first Phase-III clinical trial of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine. Sinopharm, the developer of the said vaccine, has also launched Phase-III trials in several other countries like Bahrain, Argentina, Peru, and Morocco.
Overall, Huang said the worldwide Phase III trials have involved more than 50,000 volunteers from 115 countries with leading progress in all aspects.“Hundreds of thousands of people have received vaccinations of Sinopharm’s vaccine since China launched emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines on July 22 with no cases of severe adverse effects or infection,” the envoy was quoted as saying in a statement released by the Chinese Embassy.
The top Chinese diplomat in Manila expressed optimism that the vaccine is likely to be on the market by the end of December while the company has built two high-level biosafety production facilities in Beijing and Wuhan with an estimated annual production capacity of 300 million doses.
With the expansion of production capacity, he said the annual output could reach 800 million to 1 billion doses in the future.

https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/09/holding-clinical-trials-for-covid-vaccine-guarantees-access-to-ph-but/,Holding clinical trials for COVID vaccine guarantees access to PH but…,by Ellson Quismorio,"Published September 9, 2020, 6:58 PM","
Holding clinical trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines will guarantee the country of access to the vaccine once it is proven effective, Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) Executive Director, Dr. Jaime Montoya told House members on Wednesday.
But there is a catch.
“Hindi po ethical na gumawa ng clinical trial sa isang bansa kung yung bakunang iyon, kapag mapatunayan epektibo, ay hindi naman pala magiging available sa bansang iyon (It’s not ethical to conduct a clinical trial in a country if that vaccine won’t be made available there once it is proven effective),” Montoya said during the Committee on Appropriation’s scrutiny of the proposed P23.8-billion budget of the Department of Science and Technology (DoST) under the 2021 National Expenditure Program (NEP).“So may garantiya po yan, kapag mapatunayang epektibo ‘yung bakuna, kailangang maging available sa bansa (So there’s a guarantee, once the vaccine is proven effective, it must be available in the country),” he said.
“Ang tanong lang po dito is, kaagad po ba? Kasi alam natin na sa panahon ng COVID-19, lahat ng bansa ay nag-uunahan na makakuha ng bakuna (The question here is, will we get the vaccine immediately? Because we know that all countries are rushing to get their supply of the vaccine during this time of COVID-19),” Montoya noted.
The answer to this question, Montoya said, would largely depend on the government’s negotiation with the foreign vaccine developer, “kung paano po tayo mauuna sa pila (on how we will jump ahead in the queue).”
“Pero definitely po magkakaroon po tayo ng access sa bakunang ‘yun (But we will definitely gain access to that vaccine),” he added.The Philippines’ potential role as trial country for potential COVID-19 vaccines is viewed by some as a bargaining chip in terms of assuring supply for the local population, which is estimated at 110 million. This is especially useful for the country, which unlike richer nations can’t make advance payments or pre-orders to vaccine developers.
“Would we be able to benefit when it comes to the priority of distribution? Would that be a possible benefit we could negotiate for?” Appropriations panel vice-chairman and Muntinlupa City lone district Rep. Ruffy Biazon asked the attending DoST officials in the mixed live and virtual hearings.
Montoya said that perhaps the biggest advantage the Philippine can gain from such clinical trials is knowing whether or not the COVID vaccine is effective in the context of Filipinos’ own genetic make-up, as compared to other nationalities or races.“May sinasabi na genetic variation tungkol sa pag-respond sa vaccine (There is something called genetic variation regarding humans’ response to vaccines),” he underscored.
He noted that the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) prefers drugs that have been backed by trials on Filipinos. “Mapapabilis po ang registration ng mga produktong ito para maging available sa karamihan (The registration of this product will be hastened, facilitating its availability).”
DoST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña had earlier said in the hearing that the Philippines has had for over 30 years a sterling reputation when it comes to clinical trials for vaccines. “Mahusay po ang ating mga vaccine trialist (Our vaccine trialists are very good).”
Regarding the assurance of supply, Dela Peña argued that the Philippines shouldn’t automatically commit to purchasing the first vaccine that would get positive results from a local clinical trial.
“‘Yung pag-ensure nila (vaccine developer) ng availability, hindi naman po libre ‘yun. Kailangan may pambili rin tayo. Kaya ito ay dadaan sa procurement process (As for ensuring availability of the vaccine on the part of the vaccine developer, that doesn’t come free. We still need to have the money to buy it. As such this will go through the procurement process),” he said.“Kapag ang bakuna na ito ay OK, yung isang bakuna na iyon ay OK din, hindi naman tayo puwedeng patali…na kami ay bibili sa inyo dahil dito nila ginawa yung trial. Tayo ay magko-compare pa rin sa procurement process (If this vaccine is OK, and that other vaccine is OK, then we can’t commit to buy from them just because the clinical trials were done here. We would still have to compare vaccines during the procurement process),” Dela Peña said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Department of Health (DOH) said that the price will just be one of the criteria to be considered when it comes to purchasing a vaccine for COVID-19– once it becomes available.

Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario S. Vergeire(PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Vergeire said that the vaccine’s safety and efficacy would be their first criteria when procuring it.“Kapag bumibili tayo ng bakuna, una dyan ang issue ng safety, efficacy, and effectiveness ng bakuna [When we buy a vaccine, the first consideration would be the issue of the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of the vaccine],” said Vergeire in an online forum on Wednesday.
Currently, the government is trying to map out and scope all vaccine manufacturers or developers, she said.
“Of course, gusto natin ang pinaka [Of course, we want the] best for our population. That’s why we are trying to negotiate with all these manufacturers,” she said.
“Hindi lang sa presyo [It’s not just about the price]. But of course, yung presyo [the price] would always matter,” she added.Before procuring a vaccine, Vergeire said that it should undergo the strict regulatory process of the country.
It includes an assessment from the Health Technology Assessment Council and Vaccine Experts Panel of the Department of Science and Technology; it should be registered first with the Food and Drug Administration, and must be included in the National Drug Formulary.
“All vaccines that will come through the country that will be offered to our people will have to go through the regulatory process,” she said.“Itong mga [These] different safeguards are to ensure that the government will be able to provide a safe and efficacious vaccine for all the population,” she added.
Vergeire said that it is also “very important” that the candidate vaccine should be “pre-qualified” with the World Health Organization (WHO).
“Ibig sabihin [This means], it has gone through all the processes, which are tedious for the WHO to pre-qualify this vaccine. Isa pang layer of safeguard para masabi natin na itong bakuna na ito ay binigyan ng clearance by international at reputable institutions abroad [This is another layer of safeguard for us to say that this vaccine has been given clearance by international and reputable institutions abroad],” she said.

With billions of people around the world still suffering from the fallout of the pandemic and the global death toll nearing 900,000, a worldwide race for a vaccine is under way, with nine companies already in late-stage Phase 3 trials.
Worldwide infections to date now stand at more than 27 million, and more than 890,000 people have died from the disease.Russia has already approved a vaccine, and research published in The Lancet medical journal last week said patients involved in early tests developed antibodies with “no serious adverse events.”
But scientists cautioned the trials were too small.
A spokesperson for the AstraZeneca vaccine said in a statement Tuesday that “we voluntarily paused vaccination to allow review of safety data by an independent committee.
“‘This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials.”The company said that in large trials, illnesses will sometimes happen by chance but must be reviewed independently. AstraZeneca didn’t offer further details, but medical news site Stat News, which first reported the volunteer’s illness, quoted a source saying it had involved a “serious adverse reaction” to the vaccine.
“While this is obviously not great news, remember that fully investigating adverse reactions is a part of large scale trials and essential to ensure trust in any vaccine. It will, however, mean that results will be delayed,” Harvard epidemiology expert Bill Hanage wrote on Twitter.
According Stat News, the ill vaccine volunteer was likely participating in a Phase 2/3 trial based in the United Kingdom.China, meanwhile, put its homegrown vaccines on display for the first time at a Beijing trade fair this week, and authorities hope the jabs will be approved for use by the end of the year.
The vaccines are among the handful to have entered Phase 3 trials.
Vaccine for Philippines
In the Philippines, Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) Executive Director Dr. Jaime Montoya told House members on Wednesday that holding clinical trials for a potential COVID19 vaccine in the Philippines will guarantee the country of access to the vaccine once it is proven effective.
“It’s not ethical to conduct a clinical trial in a country if that vaccine won’t be made available there once it is proven effective,” Montoya said during the Committee on Appropriation’s scrutiny of the proposed ₱23.8-billion budget of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) under the 2021 National Expenditure Program (NEP).
“So there’s a guarantee, once the vaccine is proven effective, it must be available in the country,” he said.
“The question here is, will we get the vaccine immediately? Because we know that all countries are rushing to get their supply of the vaccine during this time of COVID-19,” Montoya noted.
The answer to this question, Montoya said, would largely depend on the government’s negotiation with the foreign vaccine developer, “on how we will jump ahead in the queue.”
“But we will definitely gain access to that vaccine,” he added.
The Philippines’ potential role as trial country for potential COVID19 vaccines is viewed by some as a bargaining chip in terms of assuring supply for the local population, which is estimated at 110 million.
This is especially useful for the country, which unlike richer nations can’t make advance payments or pre-orders to vaccine developers. (With a report from Ellson A. Quismorio) SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

President Duterte announced that the Philippines will buy from the country that will offer the cheapest vaccine against COVID-19, saying all of these have the same effect any way and that funds are already tight.

Duterte made the statement after it was reported that experts are expecting to find out if one of the three potential vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, works by the end of the year or sooner.
In his public address Monday evening, President Duterte expressed optimism that a vaccine will be available as early as September.“I think it’s Moderna. It’s a US company. I think they are ready by September. Sabi ko nga pabilisan na sila. Ang Sinovac — ang China is also ready (I said it’s a race now. Sinovac — China is also ready),” he said.
Duterte believes that all vaccines will have the same effect so the Philippines will be buying from the country that will offer it at the cheapest price.
“Kung sino, pare-pareho lang naman ‘yan (It doesn’t matter who, it’s the same anyway),” he said.
“Kung sino lang ang nauna magbigay sa atin na mura doon tayo pupunta kasi (Whoever offers us the cheapest vaccine, we will go with that because) they know that we do not have enough money. Kung mahal masyado (If it’s too expensive), we will go for the less expensive ones,” he added.
“Walang pagkaiba. So hintayin na lang natin na bilisan (There is no difference so let’s just wait for them to hurry it up),” he continued.
President Duterte said last month that the Philippines may enjoy a COVID-19-free Christmas after he accepted Russia’s vaccine offer.
The Philippine government decided to do its own tests on Russia’s Sputnik V and do the Stage III trials simultaneously with Moscow who will fund it.
It was revealed over the weekend that early tests of Sputnik V showed encouraging results.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Trial zone assignment will be prioritized for the conduct of the World Health Organization (WHO) Solidarity Trials according to one of the recommendations of the Sub-Technical Working Group for Vaccine Development chaired by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).
(Joe Raedle/Getty Images/AFP / MANILA BULLETIN)
Under Resolution no. 68 dated September 3, 2020 by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID), while WHO will be prioritized, independent trials should nonetheless be considered in such a way that these will not be deprived of trial sites.
The IATF-EID approved a total of nine recommendations by the Sub-TWG to address some concerns on COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. These were mentioned by DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Pena during a Palace press briefing on Monday.It stated that vaccine recipients under the WHO Solidarity Trials will be recruited from the top five to ten barangays reporting high COVID-19 cases, based on the attack rates per 1,000 population per barangay.
The data will come from the Department of Health – Epidemiology Bureau (EB), DOH CHDs (Regional Offices) will be responsible for monitoring, and DOH EB for managing the database of all trial participants and monitoring data at the regional, provincial, city and barangay levels.
Trial sites will be at the barangay level, and randomization will be by households. The household census will be obtained from the barangays to identify residents to ensure follow up. Transient residents will be discouraged unless they can show proof that they will be staying in the area or the trial site for the next two years.
The resolution also stated that independent clinical trials by private vaccine companies will also be assigned trial zones, such that they are equally and rationally distributed to avoid competition in subject recruitment.Meanwhile, for outbreak situations, WHO Solidarity Trial Vaccine teams can move into the affected barangay provided that no independent Clinical Trial is going on or is being conducted at such time. In such a case, the next most adjacent barangay may be considered for the WHO Solidarity Trials vaccine teams.
To address shortfalls in recruitment by specific barangays, the deficit can be taken over by other barangays with faster recruitment to meet the total target sample size.
A Memorandum of Agreement is also proposed between the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and DOST, witnessed by appropriate LGU officials and the Vaccine Teams.The resolution also stated that a communication plan for the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials should consider different levels of LGU and the criteria and considerations for recruitment such as, for example, transmission rate cutoffs. Close coordination with the LGU for zoning in barangays will be made.
The barangays should be informed to prepare for immunization in case
there is an outbreak. There should be a meeting with City Health Officers to discuss the data needs and considerations for recruitment.
Considering the restriction in mobility due to enforcement of general community quarantine in some areas, alternative modes of follow-up should be put in place such as the use of Barangay health workers or local barangay volunteers, including utilization of cellphones for reminders.
Lastly, the creation of a separate Sub-Technical Working Group on Vaccine Procurement to be led by the Department of Budget and Management-Procurement Service, with the Department of Health, Department of Finance, Department of Budget and Management, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Trade and Industry.

Members of poor and vulnerable sector should be prioritized in the immunization against COVID-19 once vaccines are available in the country, Sen. Christopher Go reiterated Monday.
Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go (OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Go said giving the poor and vulnerable access to the vaccines will also address the spread of the novel coronavirus and will prevent the country’s health care system from getting further overwhelmed.
“We must keep the enemy at bay until a vaccine arrives. Hindi dapat bumagsak ang ating health care system (Our health care system should not collapse) ” Go said.“Totoong mahirap ang buhay ngayon, pero pangunahing layunin muna natin ang maitigil ang pagkalat ng COVID-19 sa ating bansa para mas mapabilis ang pagbalik natin muli sa normal na pamumuhay (Our priority should be to curb the spread of COVID-19 so we could recover quickly to normal),” he added.
The government has been working with the World Health Organizational (WHO) and other countries for the development and possible distribution of vaccines against COVID-19.
The Department of Science and Technology, which leads the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases’ sub-technical working group on vaccine development, said that while the Philippines does not yet have the capacity to produce vaccines, there have been plans to have state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities for this.
The WHO, however, recently said that it does not expect widespread immunization against COVID-19 until mid-2021. It maintained that it would never endorse a vaccine that has not proven safe and effective.Go, who served as President Duterte’s special assistant and long-time aide, said he would make sure that the poor and vulnerable will be prioritized for the vaccines.
Meanwhile, he appealed anew to the public to continue to strictly follow health and safety protocols being implemented by the government. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

GENEVA — The World Health Organization (WHO) says it does not expect widespread immunization against COVID-19 until mid-2021, despite growing expectations in the United States, the worst-hit nation, that a vaccine could be released within weeks.
The Geneva-based WHO also insisted it would never endorse a vaccine that has not proven safe and effective, amid concerns over the rush to develop a jab for COVID-19.
The disease has killed nearly 870,000 people and infected more than 26 million others worldwide as well as upended hundreds of millions of lives and wreaked havoc on the global economy.The UN health agency welcomed the fact that a “considerable number” of vaccine candidates had entered final stage trials, which typically involve tens of thousands of people.
But “in terms of realistic timelines, we are really not expecting to see widespread vaccination until the middle of next year,” WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said.
‘Trials too small’
Russia has already approved a vaccine, and research published in The Lancet medical journal on Friday said patients involved in early tests developed antibodies with “no serious adverse events.”
But scientists cautioned the trials were too small – just 76 participants – to prove safety and effectiveness.Washington has also urged US states to get ready for a potential vaccine rollout by November 1, sparking concerns President Donald Trump’s administration is rushing to begin distributing a vaccine ahead of the November 3 election.
The United States has suffered the largest number of deaths and infections of any country in the world.
Under normal procedures, test administrators must wait for months or years to verify that vaccine candidates are safe and effective.But there has been massive pressure to roll out a vaccine quickly as the pandemic continues to take its toll.
Celebrities hit
Celebrities and public figures have not been spared, with Italy’s flamboyant former premier Silvio Berlusconi taken to hospital with the disease.
The list also includes three Paris Saint-Germain footballers including Brazilian star Neymar.
Also on the list are movie stars Tom Hanks and more recently Robert Pattinson, whom Hollywood trade publications said contracted the disease while filming the latest Batman movie in Britain.
Berlusconi spent the night in a Milan hospital where he is being treated for a lung infection but where is condition is said to be “encouraging.”The 83-year-old billionaire tested positive earlier this week after returning from a holiday on Sardinia’s jet-set Emerald Coast.
Workers avoiding office
All over the world, businesses and individuals are counting the cost of the pandemic, as flare-ups continue to force governments into imposing restrictions.
France registered 8,975 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours, its highest daily figure since the pandemic swept into the country last March.
The rise comes as Paris and other cities have started requiring face masks in all public areas, including for children above 11 who returned to school this week.
The 46th Deauville American film festival in Normandy opened Friday evening with people wearing masks and social distancing. But there were few, if any American movie stars this year.
Even in areas where curbs have eased, those who can work from home prefer to keep doing so rather than return to the office.
In London’s normally bustling centre, eateries once packed with customers are suffering.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is trying to encourage people to return to the office, but that is easier said than done.
Oil giant BP, which is slashing 10,000 jobs after the pandemic crushed energy demand and prices, is actively encouraging non-frontline staff to work from home.
At Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds banks, meanwhile, much of the staff is working remotely.
Tentative recovery
It is not all bad news, though.
Both the US and Canadian economies added jobs in August, in a tentative sign of recovery from the pandemic.
And for businesses in specific sectors like personal protective equipment, Covid-19 has triggered such fierce demand that they are struggling to keep up.
Malaysian rubber glove manufacturer Top Glove said it is seeing orders for 11-12 billion a month, compared with 4.5 billion prior to the pandemic.
The downside? Customers must now wait much longer for their orders to be filled than the normal delivery of 30-40 days, said chief executive, Lim Wee Chai.
In addition, with raw materials in short supply, production costs are also rising. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The moment of truth for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) front-runners is coming as soon as this month.

The first results showing whether a vaccine can stop people from getting the virus could come by mid-September from AstraZeneca Plc, according to Airfinity Ltd., an analytics company that tracks drug trials said.
The drugmaker has pledged as many as 30 million doses to the UK by the end of the month.Two other contenders – the US’ Moderna, Inc. and the US-German partnership of Pfizer, Inc. and BioNTech SE – may also have initial data before a key Food and Drug Administration meeting on virus vaccines scheduled for Oct. 22, Airfinity said. A fourth, China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd., could have preliminary results shortly after the meeting.
Paris-based Sanofi administered the first patients with its experimental COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, bringing it a step closer to the late-stage clinical trials it aims to kick start before year-end.
The drugmaker launched human studies at 11 sites across the US. The phase 1/2 trial – which compresses the early and middle stages of clinical tests – will assess 440 healthy patients in two age groups: 18 to 49, and over 50. Sanofi, which is developing the vaccine in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline Plc., aims to have results by December, at which point it hopes to accelerate into late-stage studies.
WHO cautions front-runners
These early results will be far from the full picture. They’re what’s known as interim readouts – snapshots taken before a study is complete, with only a fraction of the data. The World Health Organization on Monday cautioned against approving a vaccine before its full risks and benefits are clear. But with the virus resurgent in Europe and continuing to spread in India and the Americas, the initial numbers will be an important early indicator.The first results should be enough to “give us a very good idea of where we’re heading,” Airfinity Chief Executive Officer Rasmus Bech Hansen said.
“They are moving faster than one could have anticipated.”
Airfinity’s projections are based on publicly available data on trial enrollment and design, together with infection rates in places where patients are enrolled.Each of these experimental vaccines has already shown promise in smaller trials designed to flag any serious safety concerns and show whether candidates can spur some response from the immune system.
Early safety data is key; unlike drugs, vaccines are typically given to relatively healthy people and shouldn’t create severe risks.
The real proving ground, though, is a study big enough to show with a high degree of certainty whether a vaccine candidate can work in the real world. This requires tens of thousands of participants, compared to the few hundred people who took the vaccines in early-stage trials.
Drugmakers would usually wait for final results before requesting regulatory approval, and the trio of front-runners are on track to get that full data by the end of the year, Airfinity says. In the US, that might not be fast enough. Overwhelmingly positive interim results could lead to studies being stopped early and the vaccines being rushed to the public, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Los Angeles Times earlier this week.
Political picture seen
Political pressure will be high to approve a vaccine if even the initial snapshot of data from these trials is promising. President Donald Trump has said a vaccine is possible by the Nov. 3 election and accused the FDA of trying to slow the approval process. Commissioner Stephen Hahn said last week he’s open to clearing a vaccine under an emergency use authorization, which is based on more limited data. Russia and China, meanwhile, have each cleared experimental vaccines for limited use before testing was complete.Pfizer has said it’s on track to have enough data for an authorization as early as October. Based on how quickly and where it’s currently recruiting people for its 30,000-person trial, it will probably be the first US drugmaker with interim data – by Oct. 15 – but won’t have full results until Nov. 17, Airfinity projects. A Pfizer spokeswoman declined to comment on how many virus cases it will need to see in order to get results in the trial.
Companies testing vaccines in the US, where the virus has spread more quickly than in Europe for the past several months, may have an advantage in potential volunteers and infections. AstraZeneca said it expects results later this year, depending on the rate of infection in the communities where it’s running trials. J&J said it still plans to start its late-stage trial this month, with first batches of vaccine available for potential emergency use in early 2021, pending the study results. Sinovac declined to comment. Moderna declined to comment on the time-frame for its data readouts.
The drugmakers have already made deals to supply hundreds of millions of doses to governments around the world.
The WHO has said any vaccine should be shown to be effective in at least half the people who get it to gain clearance. It will be important to follow participants in the trials long enough to see whether serious side effects emerge, WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Monday. A premature approval would make it hard to continue studying the vaccine in randomized trials, she said. The agency counts 176 COVID19 vaccines in development, of which 33 have entered human trials.
“What’s going to be really important, I think, is to make decisions based on science,” Swaminathan said, warning that an “inadequately studied” vaccine could present either safety problems or “low efficacy, thereby not doing the job of bringing an end to this pandemic.”
175 COVID-19 vaccine candidates
Though Sanofi and Glaxo are just now starting their latest trial, the vaccine front-runners may deliver interim data from their late-stage studies as early as this month. There are more than 175 COVID-19 vaccines currently in development, according to the World Health Organization, and 33 in human trials. A handful have ambitions to secure emergency use authorizations in the fall.
“I’m not concerned that we’re a few months behind some of the other vaccine candidates,” John Shiver, senior vice president of global vaccine research and development, said in an interview. Sanofi’s expertise in conducting trials and “experience with very similar viruses” will allow it to gain back time on its peers, he said, and ultimately, multiple shots will be needed.
The vaccine candidate relies on technology Sanofi uses to make influenza shots and Glaxo’s adjuvants, which enhance the body’s immune response. Sanofi also has a messenger RNA vaccine in development. Shiver said both candidates reported “compelling” data in pre-clinical studies.
“They showed very, very high levels of neutralizing antibodies in monkeys that are comparable to levels in humans who recovered from the Covid-19 infection,” Shiver said of the pre-clinical studies, which are to be published in medical journals later this year. That data gave Sanofi confidence as it moves to the next stage, he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Trump administration has urged US states to get ready to distribute a potential Covid-19 vaccine by November 1, in the latest sign of the accelerating race to deliver a vaccine by year’s end.
Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is asking US states to remove barriers to distributing a coronavirus vaccine
“CDC urgently requests your assistance in expediting applications for these distribution facilities,” read an August 27 letter from Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dallas-based wholesaler McKesson Corp. has a deal with the federal government to set up centers to distribute a coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available.The CDC, “if necessary, asks that you consider waiving requirements that would prevent these facilities from becoming fully operational by Nov. 1, 2020,” two days before the US presidential election, said the letter.
The US Food and Drug Administration has raised the possibility that a vaccine might be given emergency approval before the end of trials designed to ensure its safety and effectiveness.A request for such extraordinary approval would have to come from the vaccine developer, FDA chief Stephen Hahn told the Financial Times in an interview published Sunday.The CDC provided states with documents giving details of a vaccine rollout plan, adding that vaccines would either be approved as licensed vaccines or under emergency use authorization.Recipients would probably require a second “booster” dose, according to the documents.

Canada announced deals on Monday with US companies Novavax and Johnson & Johnson for millions doses of their experimental Covid-19 vaccines.
The agreements bring the maximum vaccine doses that could be made available to Canadians to 190 million, after similar arrangements were made with Pfizer and Moderna.The population of Canada is just under 38 million.“We’ve looked to sign agreements with many different companies because we really don’t know who will be first to develop a vaccine, and where it will come from,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference in Montreal.
“We need to be able to immunize as many Canadians as possible.”
Novavax’s NVX-CoV2373 vaccine candidate, which is in Phase 2 clinical trials, could be delivered in the second quarter of 2021, Ottawa and the company said in a joint statement. The agreement is for up to 76 million doses.
Johnson & Johnson has agreed to supply up to 38 million doses of its vaccine candidate Ad26.COV2.S, said another statement.Pfizer and Moderna previously agreed to deliver, respectively, a minimum of 20 million doses and up to 50 million doses of their vaccines, now in final Phase 3 trials and among the most advanced in development.
The Novavax deal comes as the US government granted the Maryland-based firm US$1.6 billion to help fund development and manufacture of the vaccine, giving the US priority for the first 100 million doses.
Early tests showed its candidate was “generally well-tolerated” and elicited a “robust antibody response,” Novavax said.“We are moving forward with clinical development of NVX-CoV2373 with a strong sense of urgency in our quest to deliver a vaccine to protect the world,” said company president Stanley Erck.
As of Monday, Canada reported nearly 128,000 cases of Covid-19 and some 9,150 deaths. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

During his weekly report on Friday, DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Pena said that they are now just waiting for the announcement of the WHO which vaccines will be used in the Solidarity Trials.
“Of course it will be the ones that are in the advanced stage of development,” he said in Filipino.To be led by the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH), the main objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a two-dose regimen of SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine against RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases.
DOST said this initiative is considered the best short-term strategy that the country could adopt to make the COVID-19 vaccine available in the Philippines at the soonest time possible. It will allow the country to avail of COVID-19 vaccine candidates which are already in the later or more advanced stages of vaccine development.
The project will also build on the local expertise already available for clinical trials and contribute in capacity building, upgrading of facilities and resources required for vaccine development and manufacturing in the country.
“Kung kukulangin naman itong P89.1 million, kung sakaling mas maraming vaccines ang papasubukan ay makakagawa naman kami ng paraan (If this P89,1 million budget will not be enough, in case more vaccines will be tested, we can still find a way to look for funds),” Dela Pena said.In a related development, the WHO confirmed the DOST’s nomination of Dr. Nina Gloriani, former dean of the UP College of Public Health of UP- NIH, as member of the Scientific Steering Committee for the WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Vaccine Trials.

(Joe Raedle / Getty Images / AFP / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Haresco, during the House Committee on Health hearing, asked the Department of Health (DoH) regarding the possibility of placing vaccine pre-orders from major pharmaceutical companies outside of China and Russia.
“Most advanced countries like the US (United States) and the UK (United Kingdom) have already pre-ordered or put a downpayment on the six leading vaccines, among which (are from companies) Astrazeneca, Pfizer, and Modern,” Haresco said during the virtual hearing.“What is the policy of the DoH and the PITC (Philippine International Trading Corp.) in pre-ordering kasi (because) Mr. Chair, if the vaccines more or less pass through Phase 3 and 4 trials by November, baka maiwanan tayo sa pansitan (we would be left behind in procurement),” he said.
“Kahit mag-downpayment lang tayo ng singko sentimos, at least naka-(pila) tayo (If we could just make a misniscule down payment, at least we’d join the queue),” noted the House Committee on Appropriations vice chairman.
Haresco cited pronouncements from US President Donald Trump that America won’t be sharing its advanced order of some 600 million doses of the vaccine. The solon said UK and Germany are also inclined to keep their supply of the antigen to themselves.
“The only countries willing to share are China and Russia.These vaccines from Russia and China, according to global press, are somewhat not in depth,” he said.Director Crispinita Valdez of the DoH Procurement Service said a host of other government agencies are involved in the procurement talks and coordination with the manufacturers of these vaccines.
“There is a committee tackling the vaccines it is headed by DoST (Department of Science and Technology). There is also a committee contacting the manufacturers. The DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) is also helping in the coordination,” she told the Health panel.
“With regard pre-payment I’m not sure about that but there is an effort to actually coordinate with manufacturers. The committee is composed of DoH, DTI (Department of Trade and Industry), DoST, and other agencies,” Valdez added.Haresco said: “I fear the words ‘coordinating’ and ‘committee,’ kasi baka walang mangyari diyan (because nothing might come out of it).”
The House committee was discussing House Bill (HB) No.6995, or the “An Act Providing for the Stockpiling of Strategic and Critical Drugs and Medicines, Vaccines, Devices, and Materials for Public Health Emergencies, Creating for the Purpose the Health Procurement and Stockpiling Bureau under the DoH.” Panel chairperson Quezon Rep. Angelina Tan penned the bill.
“Baka puwede nating mailagay sa bill na (Maybe we could have the bill say that) a competent agency will be responsible for the pre-order…para hindi magturuan ang DFA, DoST, at DoH (so as to avoid finger-pointing among the DFA, DoST, and DoH),” Haresco said.
Tan found some merit in Haresco’s corcerns about a possible delay in the procurement of the much-anticipated COVID vaccine.
“We do have foreign-funded programs and projects for support or aid na sa PITC, PBSP nagla-lodge ‘yung money (wherein the money was lodged with the PITC, PBSP). It took time. Kasi kung sa DoH ‘yan, ang ginagawa nila ipinapasa nila dito sa third party na ito (if it’s up the DoH, they would just pass it on to a third-party entity),” she said.“‘Yun ‘yung current problem natin kung dumating ‘yung vaccine natin in the future for COVID-19. Baka na-anticipate talaga natin na magka-problema tayo sa procurement (That’s the current problem once the COVID-19 vaccine arrives. We’ve anticipated that we’ll encounter problems with procurement),” added Tan.
The panel later decided to form a technical working group to further improve the provisions of HB No.6995. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the country’s vaccine experts panel is still in talks with different COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers.
“Ito pong ating mga ginagawa palang ay mga [We are still in] negotiations with the different manufacturers and also with the other governments who have committed to help the Philippines,” Said Vergeire.Vergeire said that the Philippines’ experts panel is still reviewing the results of the initial clinical trial phase of the Sputnik V vaccine from Russia.
“Last week we have requested already the Phase I and Phase II details coming from Gamaleya Institute–yung Russian na vaccine para lang mapag-aralan ng vaccine experts panel [Last week we have already requested the Phase I and Phase II details coming from Gamaleya Institute – the Russian vaccine —in order for the vaccine experts panel to study it],” she said.
“Magbibigay po kami ng impormasyon pag meron na tayong mas na advance na negotiation o kung meron mag-umpisa na o nakapasa na sa FDA (Food and Drug Administration) [We will provide information when we have a more advanced negotiation, or if we will a start (a trial), or (if the conduct of the trial) has already been approved by FDA],” she added.
Gene sequencing
In a related development, Vergeire said the public should exercise caution in interpreting the recent findings of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) on the identified lineages of COVID-19 strain in the country.
“Yung pag aaral ng RITM kailangan cautious din ang interpretation natin dyan. Yung napag-aralan ng RITM maliit na proportion pa lang ng population and it was done in hindi ganun kadaming places [We need to be cautious in our interpretation in the RITM’s study. The coverage of the RITM study was just a small proportion of the population],” said Vergeire.
In the study, the RITM has identified five lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Philippines. These lineages are named as A, B, B.1, B.1.1, and B.6.
The RITM said that lineages A and B were the original strains from China. Lineages B.1 and B.1.1 are associated with the outbreaks in Italy and other European countries. Meanwhile, Lineage B.6 was detected in India, United Kingdom, North America, Australia, and Singapore.The RITM noted that the first three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines belong to the Lineage A and B. The three individuals are travelers from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak first emerged.
Meanwhile, the samples collected in the National Capital Region (NCR), Ilocos Sur, Rizal and Laguna in March, including samples from the first two reported cases of local transmission, belong to Lineage B.6. Moreover, the samples collected last June in NCR and Laguna belong to Lineage B1 and B.1.1.
The RITM noted that the “viral genomes that have been sequenced,” together with the Philippine Genome Center “represent a very small picture of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the country.”
“The sequencing results, however, suggest that from January to July 2020, there were multiple introductions of different SARS-CoV-2 lineages and strains in the country,” it said.
Vergeire said that further study is needed to determine the origin of the COVID-19 spread in the country.
“We need more details, we need more data, we need to further the study so that we can accurately say na talagang hindi yung mga Chinese ang nagspread at nagkaroon tayo ng iba pang pinanggalingan nung mga sources of infection natin [that it was really not the Chinese [travelers] who spread [the infection] and that we had other sources of infection],” said Vergeire.

The Philippines is trying to secure access to a vaccine in development against Covid-19 as it battles the worst outbreak in Southeast Asia.
But though other regional countries like Indonesia have already inked deals with frontrunner vaccine candidates, the archipelago’s lack of capacity to locally manufacture vaccines has disadvantaged its bid.
“We are the last in the line because we can’t develop our own vaccines,” the Philippines’ former health chief Esperanza Cabral said. “If we had the capability to make vaccines, we would come first.”The country is banking on a vaccine to contain its surging outbreak that has infected over 197,000 people after testing gaffes and poor tracing rendered one of the world’s longest lockdowns ineffective. President Rodrigo Duterte has begun easing restrictions despite cases doubling this month to rescue the local economy that’s heading for its deepest slump since 1985. The Philippines will test 14 vaccines for clinical trials helmed by the World Health Organization, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told a local news channel on Monday. Moscow’s Sputnik V vaccine is expected to start mass scale Phase 3 trials in the Philippines in October.
Negotiations are also on with 16 makers of potential Covid-19 vaccines to procure supplies. The government intends to stock up shots worth $400 million and is in talks with the U.S., U.K., and China for supplies.
Regional competition, meanwhile, is heating up. A state-owned drugmaker in Indonesia is gearing up for human trials of Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s coronavirus vaccine while Singapore and Thailand are developing their own candidates. Malaysia has picked local drugmakers for packaging and distribution of vaccine doses when available.
Local manufacturing is still a possibility, according to Vergeire. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Manila has applied for an Asian Development Bank grant to study the feasibility of setting up a vaccine facility.In the meantime, the government could also partner with the private sector to fund a modular vaccine packaging facility to get its foot in the door of the global vaccine supply chain, she said. “Vaccine security will be a challenge. You cannot ensure that even if you have the money, you can get the vaccine you need,” said Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination. “The whole world is going to try to get the vaccine for itself.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The President said he would let the poor, the military, and police be given priority in the vaccine distribution once the medicine becomes available.
“Kung gusto ninyo ako mauna para magkaroon ng kumpiyansa or I can be the last Filipino to get. Unahin kayong lahat, pahuli kami (If you want me to be the first to gain confidence or I can be the last Filipino to get (the vaccine). You will be the first, we will be the last),” Duterte said during his televised address Tuesday.“Ang sigurado, hindi mahuhuli ang mahirap (The poor will certainly not be the last),” he added.
Last week, the President accepted Russia’s offer to supply the country with its coronavirus vaccine and even volunteered to take the first vaccine shot as a gesture of trust and gratitude. He previously expressed optimism the country may return to normal lives by December amid the recent breakthrough in the global race for the coronavirus vaccine.
In his remarks Tuesday, the President promised to purchase vaccines for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). He said he was even willing to borrow funds for the acquisition of the medicine.
He said the poor families receiving subsidies from the government will be the first to get a dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Soldiers and policemen will also be given priority in the vaccine distribution.
“Mauna sa lahat ang mga military pati pulis kasi kung walang pulis at military, babagsak tayo. Sino mag-guwardiya sa atin? (The military and the police will be ahead of others because if there are no policemen and soldiers, we will fall. Who will guard us?),” he said.
The President remained confident that the coronavirus vaccine will be developed soon either by Russia or China. He cited that the two countries have already committed to help the country with the vaccine supply.
“Kung may bayad dahil marami masyado, e di utangin natin, credit na lang. Or maghanap tayo ng loan (If there is a fee for the supply, we will borrow money, take credit, or find a loan),” Duterte said.
“I’m sure they’re willing to give us that privilege of borrowing from them,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Using two methods of public opinion research, WR Numero Research sought to identify the opinions of Filipinos regarding Russia’s coronavirus vaccine and the administration’s move to participate in its trials despite suspicion from experts of the vaccine’s safety.
The survey, conducted from Aug. 13 to 15 among 11,561 respondents, also found out that four out of 10 Filipinos are unsure about the Russian COVID-19 vaccine. Half agree to be vaccinated once a COVID-19 vaccine has been approved and is available.WR Numero Research said that 42 percent are unsure whether they want to be vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine from Russia. More than half disagree about the use of Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines due to lack of World Health Organization approval. Five out of 10 think the Russian vaccine is still unsafe to use as it has not yet accomplished Phase 3 of clinical trial research.
Meanwhile, WR Numero Research’s Digital Sentiment generated through its unique proprietary digital listening and sentiment analysis tool called Pathos garnered 1,646,655 engagements on Facebook from Aug. 11 to 19 and found out that 23 percent doubt safety and efficacy of Russia’s coronavirus vaccine.
It also found that 14 percent support President Duterte participating in trial of the Russian vaccine; 11 percent want administration supporters and public officials to participate in the trial as well; 11 percent condemn the idea of Filipinos being lab rats; eight percent support Russia and hopeful about the vaccine; seven percent demand Russia to conduct vaccine trial to its own people; and six percent said they trust Russia’s vaccine than China’s.
On the other hand, six percent are alarmed that a similar Dengvaxia controversy will happen; five percent criticize those who complain about the vaccine; three percent said Duterte volunteering for trial is another case of “jet ski promise” to defend the West Philippine Sea; and two percent criticized Duterte and question his unsubstantiated health claims.The survey utilized a non-probability sampling, specifically convenience sampling of users willing to participate. The data was generated through survey questions on a mobile application that users from their data partner’s online community answer.
Of the respondents, 34 percent are 18 to 25-years-old, 41 percent are 26- to 35-years- old, 20 percent are 36- to 50-years-old, and five percent are 50-years-old and above.
By geographical location, 20 percent are from Northern and Central Luzon; 22 percent are from the National Capital Region; 22 percent are from Southern Luzon and Bicol; 18 percent are from Visayas, and 18 percent are from Mindanao.WR Numero Research is a technology-driven polling and data analytics company that provides accurate, independent, and actionable data and insights into political and social sentiments, attitude, and public opinion.

Filipinos were among the thousands who volunteered in the Phase III trials of a potential COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Philippine Embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Sunday.Philippine Ambassador to the UAE Hjayceelyn Quintana commended the hundreds of Filipino nurses and volunteers who took part in the potential COVID-19 vaccine trials, during her recent visit at the Group 42 (G42) healthcare station located at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC).During the visit, Group 42 Chief Research Officer Dr. Waleed Zaher gave Quintana a walk-through of the trial process, from registration down to the actual vaccination.The ADNEC trial site is touted to be the biggest of its kind in the world. Since July 16, 2020, the potential vaccine has been administered to over 15,000 people of various nationalities, including Filipino volunteers.UAE-based Filipino journalist Neil Bie, one of the first Filipinos to volunteer in the trial, said his motivation in joining was to express his gratitude to the UAE government for caring for all foreign residents during the pandemic the same way it treats its own citizens.
At the facility, Dr. Zaher introduced Quintana to the Filipino nurses working at the site and expressed UAE’s appreciation for the role they play in the mission.G42 has 181 Filipino frontliners (180 nurses and one doctor) involved in the COVID-19 vaccine trials.Quintana said she was very proud of the Filipino frontliners and volunteers at the facility even as she thanked them for their involvement in the COVID-19 vaccine trial that will benefit humanity as a whole.“There is a core Filipino value called “pakikipagkapwa” which can be roughly described as ‘one’s care for his or her fellow human being.’ The dedication given by Filipinos involved in the vaccine trial springs forth from this Filipino value,” Quintana said.Filipino nurse Rogelio Buezon Jr. expressed elation over the visit of the Filipino envoy, saying, “This is a great way to send a message of hope that the Philippine government values the efforts of frontliners like us, especially during these times.”The UAE is among the first countries conducting a Phase III Trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine that is developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical company, Sinopharm.

As various countries are in pursuit of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, the Philippines is still a long way from achieving self-sufficiency in developing vaccines.
(PIXABAY / MANILA BULLETIN)
Dr. Jaime Montoya, Executive Director of the Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), said that vaccine development and production requires huge investments and resources.
“Most companies will tell you that they actually factor in the cost of R&D, from proof of concept to marketing. All of that has to be dealt (with) into the final cost of the product. So, we imagine for this COVID-19 pandemic vaccine…it would really be expensive,” Dr. Montoya said during a virtual press briefing of the Sub-Technical Working Group (TWG) on Vaccine Development.In a factory line of vaccine production, said Dr. Montoya, it starts from the concept to the final product that is actually distributed to the people who will use it. Starting from the proof of concept, there will be a need for a group of scientists.
After going through the proof of concept, the vaccine needs to be tested and subjected to the clinical trials. The next phase is to have the product registered with the regulatory agencies. Dr. Montoya said that product registration depends on how good are the results of the clinical trials. Upon approval of product registration, the vaccine will be made available to the public.
“So, that is the whole value chain and when it leaves the production line, it has to end up with the eventual user…So, how to make it intact and viable until it reaches its eventual customers, it is very important. So, we should actually have a clear idea of the whole value chain…and that is taken into consideration for the development of a vaccine and may be to some extent to how much a vaccine would cost,” Dr. Montoya said.
Dr. Montoya explained that the country still has a lot of things to do, upgrade and enhance in order to attain a certain degree of ability to manufacture vaccines. He said that Research and Development (R&D) for vaccine development would require significant scientific talent development involving several disciplines, planning, infrastructure, capacity building for the state of the art laboratory facilities and training of sufficient human resources.
“As far as I know, we also have to upgrade our whole value chain as far as vaccine availability is concerned,” he added.
Dr. Montoya further stated that we really have to do a lot of development. He assured that the government is already doing a lot of negotiations, discussions and plans in order to achieve some degree of vaccine self-sufficiency, to be capable to respond to the pandemic such as what is being experienced now.
DOST Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara, Chair of the sub-Technical Working Group (TWG) on Vaccine Development said that while currently the country does not have the research facility to undertake the research in developing a vaccine, the DOST has been working on establishing a Virology Science and Technology Institute of the Philippines.“We already got funding for the R&D starting next year. This will not just deal with the human viruses but also with viruses against animals and plants,” she said.
“We are just starting, but we are very fortunate that we have started developing the human resource since 2007 so we have the MS and the PHDs in all the right fields, and we have the MD PHDs who will help us undertake and develop vaccines for future pandemics but for now, we don’t have it,” she added.

The Department of Health (DOH) said on Friday, Aug. 21, that it will do away with the fourth and final phase requirement of clinical trials for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) drugs and vaccines in a bid to accelerate the national response to the pandemic.
In a statement, the health department said they made this recommendation while in discussions with the Health Technology Assessment Council, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Philippine Medical Association (PMA).
The fourth phase of clinical trials require further testing of a drug or vaccine in a bigger population, that could possibly take years after approval.“This recommendation is also not without historical precedent,” the DOH said in its statement.
“Accelerated clinical trials and regulatory approvals in response to threats such as Ebola and Meningitis contributed to mitigating the spread of Ebola and decline in the incidence of Meningitis in the sub-Saharan belt,” it added.
The statement was made after a provision in the Bayanihan to Recover as One Bill or Bayanihan 2 stated that the phase 4 trial requirement for clinical trials will be waived for any drug or vaccine under the Universal Health Care Act.
Instead of the fourth phase of the clinical trials, the health department said it will conduct safety and effectiveness surveillance and keep a database of recipients of the drugs or vaccines, who will be informed of the risks and benefits of the vaccination.Clinical trials for COVID-19 drugs and vaccines in the country may begin by the fourth quarter of 2020, while the distribution of approved vaccines to the public may start by the second quarter of 2021, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) earlier said.

As the world races to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday (Aug. 21) has yet to receive any application for clinical trials in the Philippines, said FDA-Center for Drug Regulation and Research director Dr. Jesusa Cirunay in an online forum.
(PIXABAY / MANILA BULLETIN)
Under normal circumstances, it takes 45 to 60 days to approve an application for a clinical trial, while the approval of the fourth and last stage of the clinical trials takes 70 to 90 days.
However, Cirunay said these processes would be expedited for a COVID-19 vaccine.The Inter-agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) on Thursday (Aug. 20) said applications for clinical trials must first be submitted to the Vaccine Expert Panel, reviewed by designated ethics boards, and submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for review and approval for the conduct of clinical trials.
Earlier, President Duterte accepted Russia’s offer to conduct and fund the third phase of its COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines, saying that he will be the first to take a shot to ensure its safety.
Malacañang said Duterte can only get vaccinated as early as May 1, 2021.
‘Sputnik V’ trial results
Meanwhile, some vaccine experts said the results of the first and second phase of the clinical trials of “Sputnik V,” the Russian COVID-19 vaccine, have not been released despite it already being in the third phase.
Dr. Josefina Carlos, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and a clinical trialist, said the first and second phases of the vaccine clinical trials would look into its safety, efficacy, and optimal number of doses.
“We have to look into this first. We don’t know. I haven’t read the results. The results are not published in the scientific world, if I may say,” she said.
Dr. Jacinto Blas Mantaring, chairman of the Department of Health (DOH) Single Joint Research Ethics Board, said they will not allow “Sputnik V” to go through with the third phase of the clinical trials until they have seen its preliminary results.“We will not allow any trial if there is no preliminary proof of efficacy and safety,” he said. “We need to look at the scientific and ethical considerations. We need to look at the safety reports, there should be a continuing review, to ensure the safety of research participants.”
“Hindi porke’t may pandemya ay ikokompromiso namin ang proseso, ang pag-review ay high quality (Just because there is a pandemic does not mean that we will compromise the process, reviewing is of high quality),” he added.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque recently said that an expert panel in the country will review the results of the first and second phases of the clinical trials of “Sputnik V” in September.
The third phase of the Russian vaccine clinical trials by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology will be held simultaneously in the Philippines and Russia from October 2020 to March 2021.
The vaccine is expected to be registered with the FDA by April 2021. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Zamboanga Sibugay 1st district Rep. Wilter “Sharky” Wee Palma II has justified the proposal to waive the Phase 4 trial requirement for COVID-19 vaccines to be procured by the Philippine government.
Zamboanga Sibugay 1st district Rep. Wilter “Sharky” Wee Palma II
In an interview Thursday night, Palma said the proposal, which was retained in the Bicameral Conference Committee report on the “Bayanihan to Recover as One” bill, simply intends to help the Philippines get ahead in the long queue of countries that would want to buy the vaccine once it is out in the market.
“Ang ginawa na lang namin (What we said in the bill) is, we will waive the Phase 4 requirement insofar as procurement (is concerned). Let me repeat, procurement only,” said the solon, who was part of the House of Representatives contingent in the just-concluded bicameral meetings with senators on the so-called “Bayanihan 2” stimulus package.“Otherwise, baka maunahan tayo sa pagbili (others will purchase ahead of us). Once it is open in the market, dapat nakapila na tayo (we should be in queue). We should have signified our intent to buy already,” he said.
“Definitely, we anticipate that there would be a shortage of the vaccine because worldwide pandemic to eh (this is a worldwide pandemic),” reasoned Palma, a member of the House Committee on Rules.
Millions, or even billions worth of dosages of the COVID-19 vaccine are expected to be ordered from all points of the globe. In other words, there’s a real possibility that some nations will get wait-listed for their supply of the vaccine.
Phase 4 of the vaccine development process refers to the completion of the post-marketing surveillance of the medicine. “Medyo magtatagal talaga if we will follow Phase 4 (Following Phase 4 will really take time),” Palma said.Citing the example of vaccine frontrunner Russia, Palma said its antigen candidate needs to meet three requirements in order to satisfy the procurement provision for drugs and vaccines in Bayanihan 2.
He said the Russia vaccine must 1) get approved by its Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-equivalent agency, 2) get approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), and, 3) gain international recognition. “Yun lang ang requirement natin (Those are our only requirement).”
After that, the Philippines may begin to procure (purchase) or accept donations of the vaccine.“Afterwards, we will encourage also the pharmaceutical companies that we have to conduct their own personal research and development, and even standards for the distribution in cooperation with our FDA and HTAC (Health Technology Assessment Center),” the Mindanaoan solon said.
The bicameral meetings on the P165-billion Bayanihan 2 took four days to complete. The Senate ratified the resulting report from the meetings on Thursday night.
Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez said the House would do the same next week. This will pave the way for the bill to be signed into law by President Duterte. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Anthony Fauci, the United States’ top infectious diseases official, said Wednesday the government wouldn’t make any future COVID-19 vaccine obligatory for the general public — though local jurisdictions could make it mandatory for some groups, like children.
“You don’t want to mandate and try and force anyone to take a vaccine. We’ve never done that,” said Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, during a video talk organized by George Washington University.
“You can mandate for certain groups of people like health workers, but for the general population you can’t” he added, citing the example of the National Institutes of Health, where health workers can’t treat patients without a flu shot.Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison hours earlier announced that coronavirus vaccines, once approved, would be mandatory for everyone in his country, barring medical exemptions.
But the United States’ decentralized system of government, and anti-vaccine sentiments that have been building for decades, had in any case made a program of mandatory immunization unlikely.
“It would be unenforceable and not appropriate,” said Fauci.
This however doesn’t prevent states from making a vaccine mandatory for children to attend school, as is already the case for certain diseases such as measles, though some are exempt for medical or religious reasons.At any rate, the administration of President Donald Trump has pre-ordered hundreds of millions of vaccine doses from six companies, and these will be distributed for free.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Tuesday admitted he is hesitant to endorse plans for the Philippines to participate in a COVID-19 vaccination plan that did not undergo Phase 4 clinical trial.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
Duque said the fourth phase in vaccine development is critical as this is the completion of the post marketing surveillance and is meant to ensure that a novel vaccine is safe and efficient for use of thousands and millions of people.
“Just to ensure that this, being a new vaccine, the Universal Health Care law requires that this is undertaken to ensure the safety of the product, as we all know, that any new product has some heightened risks. And so, critical trial phase 4 is really meant to protect (people),” Duque said responding to Senate minority leader Franklin Drilon’s question during the Senate inquiry on Philippine Health Insurance Corp. or PhilHealth.Asked by Drilon if he would endorse moves to dispense with a Phase 4 of clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines, Duque said he would not, considering it is a novel vaccine and the situation is evolving.
“It’s very difficult to answer but…no, no sir, knowing what I know,” Duque said.
However, Sen. Pia Cayetano pointed out it is imperative that the Department of Health (DOH) soon decide on the matter since Congress is finalizing the Bayanihan to Recover As One Act or “Bayanihan 2.”
“If the phraseology in the Bayanihan (2) Law would be such that, if WHO (World Health Organization) and other countries with recognized and mature FDAs(Food and Drug Administration) would approve the waiving of a Stage 4. Would that seem acceptable to you?” Cayetano asked.“If WHO endorses, or these countries with mature FDAs – and I understand mature FDAs include the US, UK, and Russia din pala – so if they would allow and they are okay with doing away with that, are you prepared to endorse it or do you even have to consult other experts? Hindi po kayo epidemiologist, hindi po kayo microbiologist, so do you need time to consult? Because this is very important to us,” she stressed.
To which Duque replied: “I will consult the experts, your honor. But having said that, one of the guiding principles in our pandemic response is that science should be the basis of whatever decision we make, whether to wait for Phase IV or to… We have to be open to the experts, but we have groups of experts as well, some opposing each other, some very divided, but some have very strong consensus.”
“Makikipag-usap po kami (we will consult with them). How much time can we be given, your honor?” Duque asked.Cayetano responded that the bicameral conference committee is hoping to wrap up the final version of the Bayanihan 2 on Wednesday. “I think our deadline is tomorrow. But this is a crucial issue,” she said.
She said she fears that the Philippines could be left behind if other countries decided to waive Phase 4 of the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine while the government decides to wait for the final stage before approving it.
Among the vaccines being considered by the government are Moderna from the United States, Sputnik V from Russia and one from China.
“Natatakot lang po ako, kasi nami-misquote tayo sa mga napakahalagang issue na ganito (I am afraid because we are usually misquoted over important issues like this). For the record, the reason there is a provision like that in the draft is precisely because we wanted to ensure that if WHO and countries with mature FDAs like the US are already using the vaccines, and they have decided to waive stage 4, then hindi naman pwedeng tayo lang ang nakatali, yung buong mundo, nag-vaccine na (we can’t afford to be tied on this, while the rest of the world have already been vaccinated),” she pointed out.
On the other hand, Cayetano said she does not “believe in legislating science.” Congress, however, is in a rush to approve the Bayanihan 2, which aims to boost the country’s COVID-19 efforts and revive the Philippine economy battered after the series of lockdowns imposed to contain the spread of the disease.“That’s why we are asking these questions. Because precisely, we want to craft the wording such that we are basing decisions on science. For the record because it is very important that our country’s confidence in vaccination is preserved,” she said.
“Because we already went through a trauma on vaccinations with Dengvaxia. Our country cannot afford another trauma. We cannot afford millions of infants not being vaccinated for measles, for chickenpox, for smallpox, for the polio drops, because of erroneous decisions on this, Mr. President,” Cayetano pointed out.
Sen. Francis Tolentino, meanwhile, expressed his disappointment at Duque for “dilly-dallying” on crafting a clear roadmap for a COVID-19 vaccine acquisition.
“Let me remind you Mr. Secretary that your dilly-dallying and semblance of evasion in answering the question is probably reflective of your non-bravery being the field marshall of this pandemic war,” Tolentino retorted during the hearing. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

ANKARA — China, ground zero of the novel coronavirus outbreak, confirmed its first COVID-19 vaccine patent Sunday, according to state-affiliated media.
(PIXABAY / MANILA BULLETIN)
“#China has approved its first #COVID19 #vaccine patent, which has been developed by PLA infectious disease expert Chen Wei’s team. Earlier, the phase 2 trial of the vaccine candidate found that the vaccine is safe and induces an immune response,” China Global Television Network (CGTN) said on Twitter.
Citing data from clinical trials published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that the COVID-19 vaccine candidate is “safe and generates an immune response.”The research involved 320 “healthy volunteers” aged between 18 and 59, of which 96 participated in phase-1 clinical trials and 224 in phase-2 trials, it said.
Xinhua said the results indicated that the vaccine effectively induced neutralizing antibodies in the volunteers and demonstrated good ability of a substance to trigger an immune response.
On Saturday, Russia’s Health Ministry announced that the country has started production of its first Covid-19 vaccine, noting initial batches will be earmarked for immunizing doctors and health workers before going to the general public.
Russia officially registered the world’s first coronavirus vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, on Tuesday.The announcement drew skepticism worldwide as Russia plans to continue the third phase of trials along with the vaccine’s production and use.
The coronavirus pandemic has claimed more than 772,000 lives in 188 countries and regions since originating in Wuhan, China in December.
The US, Brazil, India, and Russia are currently the worst-hit countries.More than 21.5 million COVID-19 cases have been reported worldwide, with recoveries exceeding 13.5 million, according to figures compiled by US-based Johns Hopkins University. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Philippines may ask for a “credit line” from Russia and China to facilitate the country’s payment for the coronavirus vaccine if it is too expensive, President Duterte said Monday night.
President Rodrigo Roa Duterte talks to the people after holding a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) core members at the Matina Enclaves in Davao City on August 17, 2020. ROBINSON NIÑAL JR./PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO
The President said the government is willing to pay in installment for the vaccine supply that will be offered by the two countries to the Philippines.
“This is not for free for after all they did not develop the vaccine without great expense and also the human effort involved. Bibilhin natin ‘yan (We will buy them),” he said during a televised address Monday.“If it is quite expensive then I will ask my friend (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin and (Chinese) President Xi Jinping to give us a credit, parang utang, a credit line but we will pay not in one payment but by installments. Basta ang sinasabi ko magbayad tayo. Hindi ito libre (I’m saying we will pay. This is not for free),” he said.
Duterte has proposed the payment scheme for the vaccine in case the country will be “short of money.” He recognized that like other nations, the country’s economy has been weakened by the coronavirus pandemic.
“All of the economy of the world, individual countries, have fallen flat. Lahat ngayon nagkakaroon ng (All nations are experiencing) economic hemorrhage. It is uncontrollable because people cannot really work. They cannot be productive. And so you have a problem at hand,” he said.
The President expressed gratitude anew to Russia and China for their offer to supply vaccines to the Philippines once these are available. He said a vaccine, which comes with a great expense, is the “only salvation available to humankind” in the face of the pandemic.“I would like to thank Russia, President Putin, and China President XI Jinping for offering to provide us with vaccine as soon as it is possible for distribution to the public. I can’t overemphasize my debt of gratitude,” he said.
Last week, the President accepted Russia’s offer of its coronavirus vaccine and even volunteered to take a vaccine shot as a gesture of trust and gratitude.
Russia recently announced it has registered the world’s first coronavirus vaccine and announced plans to share the supply with the Philippines. The approval of the vaccine, however, triggered safety concerns from some groups following reports it has not yet completed phase 3 trials.The Palace said the country will work with Russia on the clinical trials, production, and supply of the vaccine. The clinical trials, to be funded by Moscow, will be conducted in the Philippines this coming October. The President may be injected with the Russian-made coronavirus vaccine as early as May, 2021.
Last month, the President said the nation may return to normal lives by December while lauding the breakthrough in the global race for the coronavirus vaccine. He particularly expressed appreciation for China’s offer to prioritize the country in the access to such medicines.
Once supplies are available, he said the government intends to purchase vaccines and distribute them for free to the country’s poorest of the poor, soldiers, policemen, and those from the middle income families. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

FINDING ANSWERS
Former Senator Atty. Joey Lina
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
It’s one of the longest words in the English language and it may mean something so wonderful and extremely good. Being so, one may relate it to the awaited coronavirus vaccine being developed — the long road towards something so extraordinarily beneficial to mankind now virtually paralyzed by the pandemic.I had an enlightening talk in my Teleradyo program last Sunday with former Health Secretary Esperanza Cabral who described the arduous process in the frantic search around the world for a safe and effective vaccine which many hope would be the magic bullet to defeat COVID-19 and bring forth economic recovery.
While many vaccines for other illnesses took 10 to 15 years to develop, with the fastest at 4 years (for mumps), the world’s scientists and the entire pharmaceutical industry are now racing to develop within a year’s time the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
It’s possible to come up with such vaccine in less than a year, Dr. Cabral said, using a mix of new technologies and experience. Indeed, many reports point out massive efforts of research scientists have been “accelerated considerably by acquired knowledge developed during the generation of candidate vaccines for related SARS and MERS coronaviruses, as well as recent research into Ebola vaccines.”
Still, despite the urgent need to come up soonest with a product that protects against COVID-19 and its transmission, a vaccine must go through multiple stages — consisting of initial research and development, followed by a series of pre-clinical and clinical trials — before being approved for use by the general population.The pre-clinical trial stage is when the vaccine is administered to animals to see if an immune response is triggered and to see how safe it is. But there are reports that for some coronavirus vaccines, “researchers have been able to speed up normal protocol by testing animals and humans in parallel.”
Dr. Cabral described the clinical trials which consist of three phases. In the first phase, the vaccine is given to a small group of volunteers, usually from 10 to 50 people. The second phase covers several hundred people, while the third and last stage consists of thousands or even tens of thousands of various ages in various locations.
All three phases are administered to determine the vaccine’s potential side-effects, immune response, dosage required, and to further gauge its safety, of course.The US biotechnology firm Moderna was first in the world to start human trials last March 16, according to a CNN report last week. “Now there are six vaccines in the last stage of human trials (Phase 3) before they seek approval: Three from China — two developed by state-owned Sinopharm and one from private Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech; one from the United Kingdom produced in partnership between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca; and two from the US, one by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, in addition to the candidate by Moderna,” the report said.
But the first country to declare it had registered a vaccine and approved it for use is Russia, with President Vladimir Putin saying that one of his daughters had been inoculated. He said the vaccine, called “Sputnik V” after the Soviet-era satellite that was first launched into space, “works quite effectively, forms strong immunity… and has passed all the needed checks.”
However, the vaccine’s development process has raised concerns because, apart from being approved in Russia without undergoing the Phase 3 trial, no data on Phase 1 and 2 trials conducted by the state-run Gamaleya Research Institute have been subjected to peer review.
The Philippines will join Russia’s Phase 3 trial to be conducted from October, 2020, to March next year, according to Dr. Jaime Montoya, executive director of Department of Science and Technology Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), who said around a thousand healthy Filipinos from areas with high COVID-19 transmission will be selected.
Those joining clinical trials are not paid, according to Dr. Cabral. But they will be compensated for time lost from their work. They will be covered by medical insurance to ensure free treatment if they get sick and there will be compensation for deaths resulting from the trial.
But it remains to be seen how Filipinos would be willing to be part of the Russian Phase 3 trial amid President Duterte’s declaration that he wants to be a volunteer.Email: finding.lina@yahoo.com SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

PEACE-MAKER
Russia’s discovery of a COVID-19 vaccine seems to provide light at the end of the pandemic tunnel.President Vladimir Putin has announced that the Russian-developed vaccine offers “sustainable immunity” against the coronavirus. He revealed that it was even administered on his daughter and the results are positive.
The vaccine, developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, is dubbed “Sputnik V,” in honor of Sputnik 1, the world’s first ever satellite launched by the USSR in 1957.
We also welcome and deeply appreciate Russia’s gesture that it will supply our country with the vaccines, as announced by President Duterte and by our good friend Russian Ambassador to Manila Igor Khovaev.
Russia’s “feat” as the first country in the world to launch a COVID-19vaccine has not escaped critics, which is expected. We humbly suggest, however, that instead of sowing cynicism and intrigue, the international community should commend and support Russia in this endeavor. After all, Russia’s scientific accomplishment is good for humanity, for the world.It is easier said than done, but we also believe that when it comes to combating this raging pandemic, which has been claiming lives, shattering businesses and livelihoods, and devastating economies, countries must temporarily set aside their differences. It has been repeatedly pointed out that international solidarity and cooperation are needed to win the war against this deadly plague.
We do not think that Russia, or any other country, will unveil a much-needed and -anticipated vaccine that is not safe and effective. Doing so would be foolish, to say the least.
Currently, there are reportedly hundreds of COVID-19 vaccines that are being developed worldwide, six of which are in the final stage of clinical trials. The first three have been developed by Chinese scientists and the three others by the British-Swedish companies Oxford-AstraZeneca, the German firms Pfizer Inc-BioNtech, and the American company Moderna.
Coronavirus is truly the global community’s common enemy.

We convey our sympathies to the family of our fellow Rotarian Alfredo “Fred” Lim, who passed away last August 8.
Fred Lim served our country with great distinction as police general, National Bureau of Investigation chief, local government secretary, senator, and mayor of Manila where he captured the Filipino people’s imagination with his no-nonsense approach in combating illegal drugs and criminality.
Fred was the fifth former Philippine senator who died during this pandemic period. The other senators who recently passed away were Heherson “Sonny” Alvarez, Ramon Revilla Sr., Tessie Aquino Oreta, and Eddie Ilarde.
Fred and we, and eight others, ran in the 1998 presidential elections, where our friend, then Vice President Joseph Estrada, won. Like President Estrada and we who have remained friends up to this day, Fred and we maintained our respect for each other. We always exchanged pleasantries whenever we saw each other, especially at the regular meeting of the Rotary Club of Manila where we are both long-time members. Fred Lim was a humble and soft-spoken man and a devoted public servant. We in the Rotary Club of Manila and the Filipino people will certainly miss him. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“Ang mga trials siguro magsisimula ay gawing Oktubre pa at ang tapos niyan mga around six months pa (Trials could start this October and it will be finished after six months),” said dela Pena during his weekly Facebook briefing citing estimates made by DOST’s panel of experts.
“Sabihin na nating pinaka-maaga meron tayo vaccine either May, June or July next year (We could expect the vaccine to be available May, June or July next year),” he added.Dela Pena said the DOST panel of experts have already identified three hospitals where the clinical trials will be made, namely, the Philippine General Hospital, Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, and Manila Doctors Hospital.
“Yung ibang gustong sumali ay makiki-affiliate na lang diyan sa mga hospital na yan (Hospitals that want to participate will have to affiliate with one of these institutions),” the DOST chief advised.
Dela Pena said the panel, which also analyzes the safety considerations of the trials, are at the moment identifying “trialists” or experts who will conduct the trials.
So far, the secretary said the Philippines has reached an agreement with Russia for the conduct of clinical trials of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine.Aside from Russia, he said the governments of China, Taiwan and the United States have also reached out to them for the conduct of clinical trials for their respective COVID-19 vaccines.
The secretary said the World Health Organization (WHO) will also be conducting solidarity trials for vaccines.
“Doon sa WHO solidarity trial, naghihintay pa tayo kung alin yung final list ng mga vaccines na isasama ng WHO at tiwala tayo doon kaasi nga talagang maraming bansa ang nag-i-screen collectively (In the WHO solidarity trial, we are still waiting for the final list of vaccines and we are confident in that because there are many countries which will be screening said vaccines collectively),” he said.

(AFP/Angela Weiss)Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber was lauded for his dedication to save the theater industry by pledging to take part in an ongoing Covid-19 vaccine trial being developed by Oxford University and drug company, AstraZeneca.
A day after, the renowned composer and musical theater impresario announced on Twitter that he had completed the mission, along with a photo attachment of himself being propped up by a medical worker for his injection. “Just completed the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trial. I’ll do anything to get theaters large and small open again, and actors and musicians back to work,” the caption said.Webber’s involvement with an experimental immunization is just a part of his attempts to revive the theater stage. He vows to reopen London’s The Phantom of the Opera as soon as possible on behalf of the ensemble and producers, including Cameron Mackintosh, who admitted the show is currently facing a huge financial hit that could snowball into a permanent shutdown. Webber has also created a video series on Youtube called “Composer in Isolation,” where he takes suggestions from his fans and proceeds to play the most requested song off his vast catalog. He also squeezes in a few “Stories Behind the Scores” videos to share a detailed account of his compositions. “Composer in Isolation”
Since March, he has been very vocal about his ambition to keep the theater industry running and to bring back the confidence of the audience during the crisis, in spite of “cultural catastrophe” and the widely criticized U.K. government’s weak response for the arts.Webber has composed scores for several famous musicals, including Phantom of the Opera, Cats, and Sunset Boulevard. He was recognized as “the most commercially successful composer in history” by the New York Times. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the government’s research and development efforts include the clinical trials for lagundi, tawa-tawa, virgin coconut oil, among others, as potential COVID treatment.
The proposed establishment of a virology institute in the country is also under review by President Duterte as part of the government’s long-term plan to address a major disease outbreak, Roque added.“The Palace views that while the Administration continues to conduct information, education, and communication campaign on the use of face masks/face shields as part of preventive efforts to minimize the spread of the coronavirus, government scientists are working diligently to find local treatment for COVID-19 patients,” he said.
“The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) recently approved the clinical trial for lagundi and the clinical trial for tawa-tawa as supplement COVID-19 treatments.These trials are in addition to the melatonin, convalescent plasma, and virgin coconut oil trials,” he added.
He said the country has also joined the global efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine.
“We have been in touch with several institutions to collaborate on vaccine development and allow local manufacturing, if possible.Our country is part of the World Health Organization Solidarity Trials for COVID-19 treatments,” he said.The country also recently agreed to work with Russia on the clinical trials, production and supply of its potential vaccine for the coronavirus. The clinical studies are expected to begin this October.According to Roque, the government has also included long-term plans in the research and development efforts in fighting any outbreak of diseases in the country.
“President Rodrigo Roa Duterte is now reviewing the recommendation to establish a Virology Science and Technology Institute of the Philippines that will serve as a premiere research institute in virology and diseases to strengthen local vaccine development in the country,” he said.
Roque made the latest pronouncement after drawing flak on social media for supposedly dwelling on government’s efforts on the provision of protective gear instead of moving forward on finding the potential COVID treatment.
Some netizens have poked fun at Roque for showing off the locally produced face masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) sets during his televised briefing on Thursday. One of the memes that circulated online read: “Ang Russia nasa phase 3 na ng vaccine. Indonesia nasa phase 1 na rin. Ang Pilipinas nasa phase shield pa rin.”
In Thursday’s press briefing, Roque congratulated the local companies that have started to produce the country’s own face masks and PPE sets. He showed off samples of the products “with pride and pleasure” during the press conference aired on state television. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The country is already in talks with other vaccine developers worldwide regarding their candidate vaccines for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and not just with the Russian government, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Friday.
Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario S. Vergeire (PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)
“What we have right now, we are discussing and exploring avenues. We already have about 16 na mga vaccine manufacturers na may mga different stages na tayo ng pakikipag usap and ito ay through our bilateral partners [We already have about 16 vaccine manufacturers with different stages of discussion and this is through our bilateral partners],” said DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire during a media briefing.
Vergeire also said that the Philippines also joined the COVAX Facility. The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the COVAX Facility is “designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for every country in the world.” The country will also participate in the WHO Solidarity Trials for Vaccines.“Lahat ng pwede magkaroon ng ganitong pagkakataon na makasali tayo sa clinical trials nila ay ineexplore ngayon ng ating government [All the possibilities for us to join in the different clinical trials are now being explored by our government],” said Vergeire.
“We are not very specific na sa Russian vaccine lang. Tinitingnan at mina-mapa natin lahat na meron ngayon sa buong mundo na makaka-benefit sa ating mga kababayan [We are not very specific with the Russian vaccine alone. We are all looking at and mapping what is there around the world currently that will benefit our countrymen],” she added.
Vergeire also said that the Philippines is also in coordination with the US-based company Moderna for its candidate vaccine.
“Base doon sa mga pag-uusap at sa mga nakikita namin na reports, parang walang balak ang US na mag-clinical trials outside (of their country) pero meron sila balak magprovide [Based on the talks and the reports we see, it seems that the US has no intention of conducting clinical trials outside (of their country) but they have plans to provide],” she said.“Nagkaroon na ng pag uusap between countries, ang Philippines and US, na magprovide sila sa atin, magbebenta sila sa atin. Pero ang earliest pa ay second quarter of 2021. Iyon ang abangan natin when it comes to Moderna [There were already some discussions between countries, the Philippines and the US— that they will provide for us, they will sell it to us. But the earliest is the second quarter of 2021. Let’s wait for further developments when it comes to Moderna],” she added.
Vergeire said that among the aims of the government is to conduct clinical trials in the country to prove the safety of the different candidate vaccines.
“Iyan yung direction ng national government of the Philippines na magkaroon din tayo ng localized trials dito sa atin nitong mga phase 3 clinical trials. Kailangan natin maintindihan na ang ibang vaccines gives different effects to different ethnic groups at iyan ay evidence-based, na yung effect ng bakuna na ito ay maaaring iba doon sa isang population, race, or ethnic group [That is the direction of the national government of the Philippines that we also have localized trials here. We need to understand that different vaccines give different effects to different ethnic groups and that is evidence-based, that the effects of these vaccines may be different from that of a population, race, or ethnic group],” she said.“Tulad ng Moderna, hindi man nila gawin ang clinical trials sakali sa ibang bansa, pero tayo assured kasi yung Filipino-Americans ata isasali sa Phase 3 clinical trials nila doon. So makikita natin yung effect ng bakuna sa race natin. May ganyang details or technical intricacies ang mga bakuna. So mas papaboran natin kung magkakaroon tayo ng parallel na clinical trial here in the Philippines [Like for Moderna, even if they will not conduct clinical trials in other countries—but we are assured—because Filipino-Americans will be included in their Phase 3 clinical trials there. So we can see the effect of the vaccine on our race. Vaccines have such details or technical intricacies. So we will favor those that will have a parallel clinical trial here in the Philippines],’ she added.
Vergeire assured that all vaccines for COVID-19 will undergo the strict regulatory process of the country.
“Lahat ng vaccine, whether Russian vaccine or any other vaccine in the market right now on Phase 3 na papasok sa ating bansa, it’ll go through the regular regulatory process of the government. Because it’s a clinical trial, dadaan yan sa FDA (Food and Drug Administration) [All vaccines, whether the russian vaccine or any other vaccine in the market right now on Phase 3 that will enter our country, it’ll go through the regular regulatory process of our government. Because it’s a clinical trial, it will go through the FDA ],” she said.
“Kailangan din iyan ma-vet ng ating vaccine expert panel under ng Department of Science and Technology at kailangan din dumaan sa ethics review board [That also needs to be vetted by our vaccine expert panel under the Department of Science and Technology; and also needs to go through the ethics review board].

Nograles said residents of Quezon City and other cities in Metro Manila may qualify for the clinical studies since they belong to communities with local transmission.
“Ang alam ko, they are looking for 1,000 volunteers so it will be purely voluntary. They have to be in community na may local transmission and so with that, I think some of the residents of QC might qualify for that,” he said over ABS-CBN News Channel Friday.“But again it’s on a voluntary basis but if they are looking for areas na may local transmission, then QC and other Metro Manila cities would be candidates for that,” said Nograles, co-chairman of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), the government’s policy-making board on the country’s coronavirus response.
According to Nograles, Russia would likely conduct random selection from the pool of volunteers.
“If I were to assume how they’re gonna do it, they would probably look into which cities have local transmissions and then from there, do a randomized pagpili (selection) or something to that effect,” he said.
“I think necessarily may mga (there are many) Quezon City residents who will be asked to join the clinical trials,” he added.Russia recently announced it has developed a coronavirus vaccine and approved its limited use for health workers and other risk groups.
The approval of the vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute in Moscow, however, sparked safety concerns from some groups amid reports it has yet to finish phase 3 trials.
Russia has expressed willingness to supply vaccines to the Philippines, which President Duterte has welcomed. Manila has agreed to cooperate with Moscow on the clinical trials, production and supply of the vaccine.On Thursday, Malacañang said the President may be injected with the Russian-made coronavirus vaccine as early as May, 2021.
Duterte recently volunteered to participate in the vaccine trials as a supposed gesture of trust and confidence.
The clinical trial phase 3 will be simultaneously conducted in the Philippines and Russia from October, 2020 to March, 2021.
Russia is expected to fund the vaccine studies, according to the Palace.
Vaccine search expanded
Apart from the Russian vaccine, the Department of Health (DOH) said the Philippines is already in talks with other vaccine developers worldwide.“What we have right now, we are discussing and exploring avenues. We already have about 16 na mga vaccine manufacturers na may mga different stages na tayo ng pakikipag-usap and ito ay through our bilateral partners [We already have about 16 vaccine manufacturers with different stages of discussion and this is through our bilateral partners],” said DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire during a media briefing.

Meanwhile, Nograles said the government is finalizing the protocols for antigen testing to rapidly screen people with the coronavirus illness in the country.
Nograles said the country’s testing efforts could be enhanced since the antigen test results could be available in just 30 minutes.
“That’s why importante ‘yung, kung ma-approve na sana yung protocols for the antigen testing, because antigen will take about 30 minutes to an hour, we are finalizing that,” he said over ABS-CBN News Channel.
Last month, Nograles announced the IATF directed a technical working group to prepare the guidelines on the new diagnostic test for coronavirus.
The antigen testing, which can detect a part of the coronavirus, is expected to give “more accurate” results at a faster turnaround. (With a report from Analou de Vera)

“We are not at all reducing the regulatory rigor with which we will evaluate and hopefully approve vaccines,” Paul Mango, a senior health department official, told reporters.Washington has invested more than $10 billion in six vaccine projects and signed contracts guaranteeing the delivery of hundreds of millions of doses should they be approved following clinical trials.The vaccine doses themselves will be paid for by the government.
Doctors or clinics that administer them will have to be paid but these costs should mostly be covered by private and public insurers.
“Most” commercial insurers have agreed to waive any out-of-pocket costs to their customers, said Mango.
“We are on track to deliver hundreds of millions of doses by January 2021,” he added.Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said he was “cautiously optimistic” that at least one of the six vaccines the US had invested in would come through by the end of the year.
Critics of President Donald Trump have expressed worries that the administration may bypass safety precautions to announce a vaccine is available before the election on November 3 — a charge Mango denied.
“We are not at all reducing the regulatory rigor with which we will evaluate and hopefully approve vaccines,” he said.Russia this week approved a vaccine even before the start of the last phase of clinical trials, in which the drug is injected into tens of thousands of volunteers to verify its effectiveness and safety.
“I hope that the Russians have actually definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective, but I seriously doubt that they’ve done that,” Anthony Fauci, the United States’ top infectious disease official said at a virtual panel hosted by National Geographic.
Collins compared Russia’s vaccine, which they have dubbed “Sputnik V” after the Soviet Union’s pioneering satellites, to a game of “Russian roulette.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

CAVITE – Two pharmaceutical companies from the United Kingdom and the United States will conduct a field trial for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine in the province, Governor Jonvic Remulla announced on Thursday (Aug. 13).
“Ang Cavite ay malapit na sumailalim sa Phase 3 field trial ng dalawang kilalang pharmaceutical giant. Kasama sa pag-aaral ay ang mahigit sa 10,000 volunteer recipients ng experimental vaccine (Cavite will soon be under the Phase 3 field trial of two known pharmaceutical giants. The study involves over 10,000 volunteer recipients of the experimental vaccine),” Remulla wrote on his Facebook page.
Under the field trial, 5,000 volunteers will get the vaccine while the other 5,000 will get placebo medication as part of the standard protocol.“Ito din ay bahagi sa 100,000 sample size na parte ng pangatlong level ng pagsusuri sa epekto ng bakuna (This is also part of the 100,000-sample size which is part of the third level of trials to see the vaccine’s effectivity),” the governor added. “This will undergo intense scrutiny with the scientific community to determine its validity and efficacy. Only then will the vaccine be made available to the public.”
Meanwhile, Remulla expressed his concern over the news of Russia launching a COVID-19 vaccine.
“I have nothing against the Russians nor am I connected to any preferred country or vaccine manufacturer. I do NOT stand to gain on this but forgive me if my primary interest is to safeguard the health and safety of my constituents in Cavite. As far as I know, the Russian data is UNAVAILABLE; their methodology is NOT open; and its efficacy has not been subject to a review and analysis,” the governor wrote.
Remulla appealed to the Department of Health (DOH) to “safeguard the process of review, approval, and appropriation of the COVID-19 vaccine.”According to data compiled by the Cavite Provincial Information and Community Affairs Department (PICAD), the province has recorded 2,370 cases as of August 11.

Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri on Wednesday urged the government to be cautious in its planned purchase of COVID-19 vaccines from abroad.
Sen. Juan Miguel Zubiri (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
Zubiri said the Philippines should get the coronavirus vaccines from “reputable sources” to avoid the repeat of the Dengvaxia controversy.
“We have to make sure our FDA (Food and Drug Administration) officials will make certain that the vaccines na bibilhin po natin at ipapamigay po natin sa ating mga kababayan ay mga matitinong bakuna hindi tulad ng nangyari sa Dengvaxia (that the vaccines we will purchase and distribute to our people are safe and will not end up like Dengvaxia),” he said in an online interview with reporters.“We don’t want to have another Dengvaxia scandal on our hands,” he added.
Several officials from the Department of Health (DOH), its attached agencies, and French drug manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur were charged over the government’s dengue immunization program for schoolchildren in 2016.Dengvaxia, the anti-dengue vaccine used in the program, was criticized for putting at risk individuals who have not yet had dengue and were immunized. Hundreds of children’s deaths were also blamed on the vaccine.
“Kailangan mag-ingat po tayo (We should be careful).Let’ s continue with the testing, let’s follow science, let’s follow the reports given by the WHO (World Health Organization) about the efficacy of these vaccines bago tayo (before we) mag-hook, line and sinker, magpaturok po tayo ng bakuna (get injected with the COVID-19 vaccine). Hindi po natin alam baka mapasama pa sa atin (We might not know that these could put us in more danger),” Zubiri said.“We want to make sure vaccines that we get are very good, ‘yong talagang high level of resistance ang nabibigay niya (that it will give a really high level of resistance),” said the senator, who is also a COVID-19 survivor.President Duterte had recently accepted an offer from Russia to supply potential coronavirus vaccines to the Philippines. He also volunteered to take the first shot of the vaccine reportedly called “Sputnik V”.
Some scientists, however, were skeptical about Russia’s claim that its vaccine is ready for use, citing the need for more trials to determine if it is safe and effective.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said the government “must act on the basis or our national interest” regarding its purchase of COVID-19 vaccine.
“We are being asked to participate in the testing. I would rely on the judgment of our health authorities to hand this request. What is important is we must have access to this vaccine once it is tested and accepted in the market. It is essential for the health of our people,” Drilon said in a separate virtual briefing.
Zubiri said that in including funds for the purchase of vaccines under the proposed Bayanihan 2 law, he said he will propose a provision that would mandate the government to buy vaccines not only from one country, but should be sourced out from different countries. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Lim said the agency will appropriate funds to ensure the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines through the help of the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC), an attached agency under the Department of Trade and Industry.
The MMDA is in coordination with PITC President and CEO Dave Almarinez, Lim said.
“Once finalized, the agency will execute a Memorandum of Agreement with PITC for the inclusion of MMDA in the procurement of the vaccines worth ₱20 million,” the agency noted.
Per the agency, PITC has been mandated by Pres. Duterte to purchase COVID-19 vaccines from overseas.
“The vaccine will add up to our sustained efforts against COVID-19. Our personnel who are mostly frontliners can be fully secured of their health,” the MMDA chairman said.
According to Lim, each employee can also nominate one member of their family to receive vaccination as well. “Our employees’ families are as important as they are to us. We want them to be protected, too.”MMDA General Manager Jose Arturo Garcia, meanwhile, stressed the importance of getting vaccinated against the coronavirus.
“Vaccination can stop the spread of the virus. COVID-19 spreads from one person to another, but when a person is vaccinated, he is protected from the virus. COVID-19 vaccines can help boost our personnel’s immune system, thus decreasing their risk from getting the virus,”Garcia said.
The MMDA currently has over 8,000 employees, with almost 80 percent working in the field in various locations in the metropolis. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sen. Juan Miguel Zubiri (Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Zubiri said he supports the allocation of more funds for the government’s forthcoming vaccination program to put an end to the coronavirus epidemic.
He said lawmakers from both houses of Congress are set to discuss tomorrow, August 13, in pre-bicameral conference committee meeting the provisions of the proposed “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act”.“I think part of the funds will be utilized for Bayanihan 2 will be set aside —this was of course unofficially mentioned within our chat groups— for purchases of vaccines, para hindi na po tayo kailangan maghintay pa ng (so we will no longer have to wait for the) budget for 2021,” Zubiri bared.
“Dahil napakarami nang (because there are a lot of) vaccines that are starting to come out in the market…Ang ayaw natin mangyari mahuli tayo sa pagbili ng vaccines (We don’t want to be late in purchasing vaccines),” he added.
The Senate’s version of the bill provides a P140-billion standby fund to support programs responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, proposed a P162-billion allocation.
The Department of Finance (DOF) earlier said it could only commit some P140 billion due to the government’s depleting funds for this year.“We are looking into the budget kasi napaka-meager ng amount, ‘di ba, P140 billion, napakaraming industriyang humihingi ng tulong. Pero siyempre bibigyan natin ng halaga ang pagbili ng bakuna kung gusto nating bumalik sa normal (But of course we will have to prioritize the procurement of vaccines if we wanted to return to normal),” he said.“By doing that, we will have to get the budget of the other industries that need help,” he continued.
Zubiri said he will also appeal to the DOF and the DOH for the increase of the budget for vaccines so that industries that are badly affected by the pandemic could also slowly recover.
“I’m sure papayag naman po si Secretary [Carlos] Dominguez kung magdagdag tayo ng P3 billion. Gawin nating P5 billion for vaccines, initially,” he said.The Department of Health (DOH) had initially set aside P2.4 billion for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines under its proposed 2021 budget.

Regulatory authorities are expected to “go out of their way” to hasten the clinical studies for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Russia following President Duterte’s willingness to be the first to receive it, Malacañang said Wednesday.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque recognized that while the President welcomes the Russian-made vaccine for the coronavirus, it must still pass the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) safety standards.

“I don’t think it’s false hope because when the President said he wants to be injected with it, I think the FDA would have to go out of its way to fast track the clinical studies that are required and it can be done anyway,” he said over CNN Philippines Wednesday.“The words of the President constitutes actionable policy and it’s a signal also to our local FDA to do everything and anything it can to make sure that it can be administered to the President safely,” he said.
Russia earlier announced it had developed a coronavirus vaccine called Sputnik V and would soon enter mass production despite growing skepticism from some sectors about its safety and efficacy.
President Duterte has offered to take the coronavirus shot to dispel safety concerns,citing his trust in and gratitude to Russia.
According to Roque, thecoronavirus vaccine from Russia must still go through the FDA process before allowing public use.
“The good news is the Russians have declared that they have a vaccine. Whether or not we could actually use it will depend on compliance with our existing laws, because we have a statute which penalizes the use of any drug without prior approval of the FDA,” he said.
“And before the FDA could approve it, the universities will have to conduct clinical studies to prove that it has no adverse effects,” he added.Roque said the FDA could classify the vaccine for “compassionate use” but only on a limited basis.
“That goes for any vaccine that’s developed anywhere else in the world and that is why as early as now, we have been cooperating not only with WHO (World Health Organization) but with individual countries that are racing to develop the vaccine to help also in the worldwide clinical studies to be conducted,” he said.
Roque said having a vaccine is the only way to find “closure” to the coronavirus problem.“But let’s allow the FDA to do its job because after all, that’s why the lawmakers established the FDA,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In an interview with CNN Philippines, FDA Director-General Eric Domingo raised concern about the Russian vaccine because it has yet to enter Phase 3 or the last phase of clinical trials.
Domingo said he would also like to know what “approval process” the vaccine went through.“Usually, we approve vaccines after the completion of the third phase of the clinical trials,” Domingo said.
“We really want to know how accelerated the approval was and what the basis was for that,” he added.
When asked if a separate trial on the Russian vaccine will be conducted in the country, Domingo said such will depend on the developer or clinical trial sponsors.
“Unless the clinical trials are sponsored, for example, by the Department of Health, [then] that can also be done,” he said.Domingo said the FDA approves vaccines only after the completion of tests on a large number of patients and once the “safety and efficacy” of the vaccines are assured.
The FDA director said a vaccine will “probably be available” by the end of the year or early next year, noting that there are already about six vaccines in the last phase of trials.

President Duterte is willing to be a “guinea pig” for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Russia but such action will still depend on the approval of his security team, Malacañang said Wednesday.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said although the President has offered to risk his life to take the vaccine shot, he has actually “limited” free will for safety and security reasons.
“It was perfectly fine for him to offer it because that’s his way of telling the people that ‘I want us to have a vaccine and if I have to be a guinea pig for it, i don’t mind.’ Because that’s the attitude of the President. He’s old, he’s at the end of his term, he can sacrifice his life for the Filipino people,” he said over CNN Philippines Wednesday.“But as to whether or not the PSG (Presidential Security Group) will actually allow him is a different thing,”he said.
Roque said the PSG implements strict safety and health protocols to ensure the President’s wellbeing especially during the coronavirus pandemic. He recalled that after delivering his State of the Nation Address (SONA) last month, Duterte wanted to shake hands with lawmakers but the PSG did not allow him.
“It’s difficult to be President because you have limited free will. The PSG is there to guard you and they are very good at doing their job,” he said.
The President recently accepted Russia’s offer to supply potential coronavirus vaccines to the Philippines and volunteered to take the first shot. The Palace already sent word to Russia that the Philippines is ready to work with Russia on clinical trials, vaccine supply, and production but stressed that such cooperative initiative must be “consistent” with testing and health protocols.
Russia recently unveiled its potential vaccine for the coronavirus, reportedly dubbed Sputnik V, with plans to test the product in foreign countries like the Philippines. Some scientists, however, are skeptical about Russia’s claim about the vaccine, citing the need for data to determine if it is safe and effective.
Roque said Russia’s coronavirus vaccine must still hurdle the regulatory approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). He said authorities could allow “compassionate use” of a potential coronavirus drug for limited people but not for mass distribution.
He said the President is grateful for Russia’s offer to supply vaccines to the country owing to the friendly relations between them. He said the government has sought clarification if Russia will give the vaccines for free.
“He already recognizes that he has a debt of gratitude because the Russians considered us first for the vaccine,” Roque said.
“If Russia had developed this and we did not have the same kind of ties that we do now with Russia, they would not have offered it to us,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

As of July 31, the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed 165 COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Out of that number, 139 are under pre-clinical evaluation or being studied and tested on animals, and 26 are already undergoing clinical or human trials.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials have three phases: Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3.Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP) President Dr. Beavery Tamesis said Phase 1 is a “safety” test of the vaccine conducted on a small group of volunteers of around 10-12 people. Dr. Tamesis is also the country president of Merck Sharp & Dohme (Merck & Co.).
“[In this phase] you’re trying to figure out, how many of them will develop side effects, and how many of them will develop an antibody response,” Tamesis told Manila Bulletin in an interview via Zoom.
In Phase 2 or the expanded trial, the vaccine will be tested on about a hundred people. It is during this stage that the correct dose of vaccine is being identified, according to Tamesis.
The last phase, Phase 3, is a “large-scale efficacy trial” of the vaccine, according to Tamesis. The vaccine now will be tested on thousands of volunteers.“Some will be given the vaccine being studied and the other half will be given salt water or saline just to see whether or not there is really an effect or difference between these two,” Tamesis explained.
Six leading vaccines
To date, there are six COVID vaccine candidates that are already on the final phase of clinical trials, according to the WHO.
Three of the six vaccine candidates are being developed by China-based pharmaceutical companies – one from Sinovac, and the two are from the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, and Beijing Institute of Biological Products which are both under Sinopharm.
Also in the last phase of trials are vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and University of Oxford; Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; and BioNTech, Fosun Pharma, and Pfizer, according to the WHO.
Sinovac (China)
Sinovac started clinical trials on its Adsorbed COVID-19 (Inactivated) Vaccine or CoronaVac on July 21, according to theUS National Library of Medicine’s website.
Sponsored by Butantan Institute in São Paulo, Brazil, Sinovac targets to test its vaccine on 8,870 participants.
Among counties which are testing the efficacy of Sinovac’s vaccine are Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, Bangladesh and Chile.
Sinovac expects to complete its study by October 2021, based on data from the United States National Library of Medicine.
Sinopharm, Wuhan Institute and Beijing Institute (China)Both the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Beijing Institute of Biological Products are testing the efficacy of an inactivated SARS-Cov-2 vaccine, according to the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry’s website.
The Wuhan Institute of Biological Products is targeting to recruit 5,000 participants for its trials.
Trial on the candidate vaccine of Wuhan Institute of Biological Products is also being conducted in the United Arab Emirates, particularly in Abu Dhabi.
AstraZeneca & University of Oxford (United Kingdom)
AstraZeneca started its trials for its ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or MenACWY vaccine on March 1, 2020.
Funded by the University of Oxford, AstraZeneca aims to test its vaccine on 2,000 people, particularly in Brazil.
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has been called “the most promising” COVID-19 vaccine candidate in the world by Brazil’s Acting Health Minister General Eduardo Pazuello.
On August 7, Reuters reported that Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has already issued a decree to set aside US$356 million in funds to “purchase and eventually produce,” the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford researches.
AstraZeneca’s trial is expected to end on October 31, 2021.
Moderna (United States)
Moderna’s investigational vaccine called mRNA-1273 is considered one of the leading candidates among candidate vaccines, according to the US National Library of Medicine website.
The US National Institute of Health (NIH), citing an August 5 research of London-based scientific journal Nature, said Moderna’s vaccine showed promise in its mouse trials.
The trial is expected to be completed on October 27, 2022.
BioNtech (Germany), Fosun Pharma (China), and Pfizer (US)
BioNTech in collaboration with Pfizer and Fosun Pharma developed an RNA-based vaccine for COVID-19, according to US National Library of Medicine website.
A RNA-based vaccine, according to the Milken Institute, is “an experimental vaccine which provides immunity through the introduction of genetic material (RNA).”
“RNA vaccines can also be potentially developed more quickly and easily than other vaccines,” it added.
The vaccine candidate entered Phase 3 of clinical trials in July 2020. BioNTech has about 29,481 participants for the trial of the vaccine which is being conducted in Argentina, Brazil, and the United States.
The trial is expected to be completed on November 11, 2022.
When will we have a vaccine?
Despite the “overly optimistic projections,” Dr. Tamesis said the most realistic progress that can be achieved by end of 2020 or early 2021 in terms of vaccine development is “getting good data.”
To be able to get good data, Tamesis said developers and researches should conduct its trials in countries where there are many reported transmissions.
“You have to identify a place where maraming virus na spreading (the virus is spreading) throughout the community because if there is no virus spreading, you will never prove that your vaccine worked,” he said. He cited Brazil, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines as good vaccine trial sites.
The PHAP president expressed hope that a vaccine will be approved “sometime early 2021.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Although none of the coronavirus vaccines under development has proved its efficacy yet in clinical trials, at least 5.7 billion doses have been pre-ordered around the world.
Countries and organisations that have announced advance agreements to acquire doses of COVID-19 vaccines
First shipments of a COVID-19 vaccine created by Western laboratories have often been snapped up by the United States.
Five vaccines — three Western and two Chinese — are in Phase 3 efficacy trials involving thousands of people.In a surprise announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed Tuesday that a vaccine dubbed “Sputnik V” — after the Soviet satellite — conferred “sustainable immunity” against the novel coronavirus.As research laboratories around the world race to develop a vaccine, manufacturers have received financing to help them prepare to have millions of doses ready to administer in 2021 or even before the end of the year.
Oxford University, working with the Swedish-British pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca, hopes to have results by September while the US biotech company Moderna, partnering with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), is aiming for the end of the year, possibly November.
– US: 700 million doses –
President Donald Trump has launched “Operation Warp Speed” in a bid to develop, manufacture and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine to all Americans by January 2021.Hundreds of millions of dollars have been directed to vaccine developers including nearly $500 million to Johnson & Johnson at the end of March.
The United States has allocated funding to more companies than other nation in the hope that one of them will come up with the vaccine to counter the highly contagious virus.
So far, Washington has handed out at a total of least 9.4 billion dollars to seven vaccine developers and signed manufacturing contracts with five of them to provide 700 million doses.The companies involved are: Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Oxford/AztraZeneca, Novavax, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sanofi/GSK, Merck Sharp and Dohme.– Europe: 700 million doses
Two vaccine developers — Oxford/AztraZeneca and Sanofi/GSK — have signed or are in advanced negotiations with the European Commission to provide a combined 700 million vaccine doses.
– Britain, Japan, Brazil –
Britain, because of Brexit, is negotiating a separate pre-order of 250 million doses from four developers.
Japan is counting on 490 million doses from three suppliers including 250 million from Novavax of the United States.
Japanese pharmaceutical giant Takeda bought the rights to a Novavax vaccine for Japan, which has funded the research. It would be produced locally.Brazil chose a similar model, ordering 100 million doses from AstraZeneca, and partnering with China’s Sinovac to produce 120 millions of “CoronaVac,” which is already undergoing testing with Brazilians.
– China, Russia –
Clinical tests of two Chinese vaccine candidates — Sinovac and Sinopharm — are well underway but only a few international partnerships have been announced, the one with Brazil and a possible one with Indonesia.
Russia said 20 nations have pre-ordered one billion doses of Sputnik V and that with foreign partners it would be able to produce 500 million doses a year in five countries.
– Developing countries –
TheCoalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), launched in 2017 by Norway, India, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, seeks to ensure that there is “equitable access” to future vaccines.
It has pre-ordered 300 million doses from AstraZeneca for dozens of developing countries in a partnership with The Vaccine Alliance (Gavi).
Billions of doses would be produced for Asia and elsewhere by the giant Serum Institute of India (SII), the largest vaccine producer in the world.
Novavax and AstraZeneca have separately signed agreements with SII to produce a billion doses each for India and low- and middle-income countries on the condition, of course, that they prove their efficacy in clinical trials. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“The first registration has taken place,” Putin said Tuesday at a televised government meeting, adding that one of his daughters has already been given the vaccine. “I hope that we can soon begin mass production.”
The move clears the way for widespread use of the vaccine, named Sputnik V, among Russia’s population, with production starting next month, although it may take until January to complete trials.Medical workers could begin receiving the drug by the end of the month, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said at the meeting.
The announcement represents a propaganda coup for the Kremlin amid a global race to develop vaccines against the coronavirus pandemic and accusations that Russian hackers sought to steal international drug research.
The disease has killed nearly 750,000 people, infected more than 20 million and crippled national economies.
Companies including AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna, Inc. are still conducting final-stage trials of their vaccines in studies that are expected to soon yield results.Sputnik comparison
Russia indicated how it regards the development, naming the vaccine Sputnik V in a nod to the Soviet Union’s achievement in launching the world’s first satellite into space in 1957.
Yet the speed with which the vaccine has received regulatory approval has drawn criticism, with a local association of multinational pharmaceutical companies calling the rushed registration dangerous.“This is a political decision by Putin so he can claim that Russia was the first in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine,” said Svetlana Zavidova, executive director of Russia’s Association of Clinical Trials Organizations. “I can’t understand why Russia needs to build this Potemkin village.”
The vaccine is being developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which have said it is undergoing Phase 3 trials, the final stage of testing during which it is given to thousands of people to determine its fitness for use. A World Health Organization database lists the vaccine as still only in Phase 1 testing, the earliest stage.
RDIF chief Kirill Dmitriev dismissed criticism that the developers haven’t published peer-reviewed results to date during a press conference Tuesday.
Test Data
“Following Russian regulations, they can publish it easier after the registration,” Dmitriev said about data from the initial trials, adding that the results are “incredibly impressive” and will be published soon.
RDIF will be able to produce more than 500 million doses a year in five countries, with mass immunizations in Russia planned to begin in October, Dmitriev said.
RDIF plans to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, India, and the Philippines, according to the Sputnik V website. Mass production is lined up in India, South Korea, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Cuba, it said, with at least 20 countries interested in obtaining supplies.
WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said last week that all vaccine candidates should adhere to established practices and finish clinical trials before being made widely available.
The Russian candidate is a viral vector vaccine based on a human adenovirus — a common cold virus — fused with the spike protein of SARS CoV-2 to stimulate an immune response and is similar to one developed by China’s CanSino Biologics.
The news comes as Russia reported daily COVID-19 cases dipped below 5,000 for the first time since April 23, with the number of infections continuing a slow decline from its May peak.
The seven-day moving average has fallen for the last 31 days, with new cases less than half of the 11,656 reported on May 11.
Russia has nearly 900,000 people diagnosed with COVID-19, the fourth-most confirmed cases in the world.
It had over 27,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the second quarter, according to Federal Statistics Service data published this week. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and Department of Health (DOH) announced on Tuesday their commitment to fund and support the country’s participation in the World Health Organization (WHO) Solidarity Vaccine Trial as part of the efforts in joining the global action in developing a vaccine against COVID-19.
Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara
“We are in close collaboration with WHO to intensify our preparations for the Solidarity Vaccine Trial, including the identification of trial sites in the country. In addition, we are continuously monitoring several vaccine candidates with the technical help from the Vaccine Expert Panel,” said Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara, Chair of the sub-Technical Working Group (TWG) on Vaccine Development and DOST Undersecretary for Research and Development. DOST- Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD) said that the Solidarity Vaccine Trial will ensure prompt, efficient, and reliable evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the many SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates currently being developed worldwide. To date, over 100 countries have expressed interest to participate in this large-scale vaccine trial.The Philippines’ participation in the trial was approved by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) as recommended by the Sub-TWG on Vaccine Development led by DOST.
Two weeks ago, DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña announced that the agency has nominated a representative to be part of the WHO COVID-19 candidate vaccine prioritization working group which aims to identify the vaccines to be included in the upcoming WHO Solidarity Vaccine Trials.
Dela Pena said during his weekly report that the agency has nominated Dr. Nina Gloriani, Professor Emeritus at the University of the Philippines-Manila.
The secretary said that the DOST Vaccine Expert Panel created to assist the Sub-TWG on Vaccine Trials is continuously holding meetings with companies willing to conduct clinical trials in the Philippines.
Last June, DOST and PCHRD discussed its plans to capacitate local vaccine manufacturing in the country if clinical trial results are favorable.
“The DOST has been in touch with several international partner institutions to collaborate on vaccine development so that we can participate in their clinical trials, as the country doesn’t have the capacity yet to develop vaccines on its own,” said DOST Undersecretary Guevara said.“Locally, we hope that the local pharmaceutical industry is open to the opportunity of capacitating our country in vaccines, not just for this pandemic, but to prepare for the future as well,” DOST Secretary de la Peña added.To give participants ideas on international discussions on COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Gloriani presented the list of best vaccine candidates, the status of development, and vaccine platforms of nine international partners which expressed interest in conducting clinical trials in the country.
As part of DOST’s business propositions to pharmaceutical industries, Dr. Jaime C. Montoya, Executive Director of DOST- PCHRD stressed that the government will provide support to the private sector’s conduct of clinical trials and assistance in product registration for pharma groups.
“The Philippines will be dependent on global supply of vaccines if it will not be developed locally, so to get hold early, it will be beneficial for the country to require a license to manufacture for local pharmaceutical industries and to meet the local demand for vaccines,” said Dr. Montoya.

But that is the initial amount that we set aside for our next year’s budget],” she added.
Vergeire said that the DOH is closely coordinating with other government agencies for the purchase of vaccines once available.“We are still working with other government agencies para maiayos natin ito, especially DOST (Department of Science and Technology), and of course kasama na dyan ang DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) kasi sila yung nakikipag usap when it comes to international transactions, and the DOF (Department of Finance) [We are still working with other government agencies in preparation for this, especially the DOST, and of course that includes the DFA because they are the ones coordinating when it comes to international transactions, and the DOF],” she said.The Chinese government recently vowed that the Philippines is one of its priority recipients once it develops a COVID-19 vaccine. President Duterte also said that the government is also in talks with Russia for a supply of its potential vaccine.AviganIn a related development, Vergeire said that clinical trials of the Japanese anti-flu drug Avigan will start on Monday, August 17.“We start on August 17.One hundred patients ang ating ire-recruit [We will recruit 100 patients]. Drugs are here, protocols have been approved by FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and Ethics Board,” said Vegeire.The patients that will be allowed to participate must be 18 to 74 years old and have no pre-existing condition such as heart and kidney ailments. Participants must also agree to use contraceptives because of the “teratogenic” effects of Avigan.
The DOH earlier announced the venue of the clinical trials: Sta. Ana Hospital, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital, and the Quirino Memorial Medical Center.Other countries that are conducting study for Avigan include China, Italy, Russia, and the United States of America.

Duterte made the statement after Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev told reporters in a virtual press briefing that the results of Russia’s vaccine trials are turning out to be “very promising.”
Khovaev had said that proposals for the clinical trials and the production of the vaccine in the Philippines were already with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA)In his Monday public address, Duterte said he was over the moon with Russia’s gesture toward the Philippines, saying this proved that the two countries are very good friends.
“Nagpapasalamat ho ako sa inyo sa mabuting loob ninyo sa Filipino. Someday, we will, makabayad man lang kami sa utang na loob sa inyo (I thank you for your kindness toward Filipinos. Someday, we will repay you),” he said Monday evening.
“I promise you that the Philippines and Russia will remain friends forever,” he added.
To show his gratitude to Russia, President Duterte said he would be the first to take a vaccine shot to show that he trusts their studies and to make sure that it is safe for Filipinos.
“Ako, pagdating ng bakuna, in public, para walang satsat diyan. In public, magpa-injection ako. Ako yung unang ma-experimentuhan, okay sa akin (When the vaccine arrives, I will take it in public. Experiment on me first, that’s fine with me),” he said.
“Sabihin ko rin kay President Putin na malaki ang tiwala ko sa (I will tell President Putin that I have faith in)… your studies in combating COVID and I believe that the vaccine you have produced is really good for humanity,” he added.

“Kaya lang (However), whether or not it is safe for a particular race, hindi natin malaman (we will not know) unless we go into clinical trials,” he added.
Putin’s promise
President Duterte shared that President Putin once promised him when they last met in Sochi that Russia will assist the Philippines in any medical endeavor.
“Sabi niya (He said), ‘If you have a medical question mark on anything about medicines or cures, feel free to call me and anyone you’d like to be confined and treated here in Russia, we will [help],’” Duterte recalled.

The Philippines may just be a few months away from heaving a sigh of relief as Russia prepares to officially register what could become the world’s first vaccine against COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).
Russia is one of the few countries that expressed readiness to supply the Philippines with the COVID-19 vaccine once mass production in Moscow starts.Russian authorities earlier announced that the vaccine developed at the Gameleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology will be officially registered on Wednesday, August 12, 2020, in preparation for the third and last stage which is the testing to ensure that the vaccine is safe.After the final stage, Russian health officials are planning a nationwide mass vaccination program sometime in October giving priority to medical workers and the elderly.On Friday, Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev assured the Philippines that Moscow is ready to supply Manila and even invest in the local production of the vaccine.Khovaev said after the completion of all the bureaucratic procedures by mid-August, Russia will be ready to prepare for launching what he described as an “effective and safe” COVID-19 vaccine.Russian experts defended the manner they managed to research and approve a formula for the vaccine, citing their country’s head start over the last 20 years it has spent in developing skills and trying to understand how viruses transmit.Aside from Russia, China also assured that it will prioritize the Philippines should the COVID-19 vaccine be made available for commercial use and distribution.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Philippines, under the leadership of President Duterte, continues to deepen its engagements with Russia, United States, and other countries to ensure that Filipinos would have access to the development and supplies of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines once these are made available, Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong’’ Go said on Monday.
Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go (OFFICE OF SEN. BONG GO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Go, chairman of the Senate Health and Demography Committee, issued the statement after receiving a letter, dated August 1, from Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Philippines Igor Khovaev who informed him that Russia was nearing completion of the production of the vaccine against COVID-19.
Khovaev has subsequently confirmed that Russia has already successfully completed the clinical trials (phase 3) for the world’s first vaccine against COVID-19.“Tatlong bagay ang nasa offer ni Ambassador Khovaev. Una, na dito rin sa Pilipinas mag-conduct ng clinical trials. Magsu-supply din sila sa atin ng bakunang ito kontra COVID-19.At, pangatlo, plano nilang mag-set up ng local manufacturing dito mismo sa bansa natin,’’ Go said. (Ambassador Khovaev has offered three things: First, the clinical trials will be conducted here in the Philippines;second, they will supply usthe vaccines against COVID-19;and third, they are planning to set up local manufacturing here in our country.)
The vaccine, using the trade name “Avigavir,” has been developed by the National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology under the name of N.F. Gamaleya of the Russian Ministry of Health.
The center has previously developed successful vaccines against Ebola fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus. The vaccine research was supported by the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). It was the RDIF that proposed to establish partnership with the Philippines in the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing and distribution.
“Dahil sa maayos na independent foreign policy of ‘being an enemy to none and a friend to all’ ni Pangulong Duterte, nasisiguro ng pamahalaan natin na meron tayong access sa development at, eventually, mga supply ng bakuna kontra COVID-19 mula sa mga bansa na itinuturing nating mga development partners,’’ Go explained.(Due to the good independent foreign policy of ‘being an enemy to none and a friend to all’ of President Duterte, the government has been assured access to the development, and eventually, we will have the supply of the vaccine against COVID-19 from the countries we considered as our development partners.)Go attributed President Duterte’s independent foreign policy for this, which is anchored on a national security policy that puts a balanced emphasis on the welfare and well-being of the Filipino people.
The senator from Davao also stated that the Philippine Ambassador to the United States, Jose Manuel Romualdez, confirmed that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is urging two vaccine manufacturers to meet Romualdez anytime this week. “Inaayos ang pagpupulong between our ambassador to the United States and at least two vaccine manufacturers in the US (The meeting between our ambassador to the United States and at least two vaccine manufacturers in the US is now being arranged),” Go said.Novavax is reportedly also interested in co-manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines.
The President, in his recent State of the Nation Address (SONA), also revealed that he talked to his Chinese counterpart President Xi Jinping to ensure access of the Philippines to Chinese vaccine against COVID-19, Go said.
As of August 7, at least six vaccines are entering Phase 3 trials, according to Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization – Health Emergencies Program.
Phase 3 trials are conducted involving the general population and are required before making available to the public any vaccine produced to further ensure its safety.They are designed to determine if the vaccine being developed can protect a large number of people over a longer period of time.Previous trials had focused on safety, immunogenicity, and immune response in a smaller number of people.
To date, at least 165 vaccines against COVID-19 are being developed under various trial stages, with 26 of them now under clinical trials.Go previously urged the national government to come up with a national vaccine program to ensure access particularly for the poorest of the poor and other vulnerable Filipinos should a vaccine against COVID-19 become available. “Unahin dapat ‘yung mga mahihirap na nangangailangan ng vaccine pero walang kakayahan na makabili nito. Dapat siguraduhing maging available, accessible at affordable ito sa lahat. Dapat pantay-pantay,’’ he said. (We should prioritize the poor who need the vaccine but do not have the means to buy it. We should also ensure that the vaccine will be available, accessible, and affordable to all. It has to be fair.)
The Department of Finance had earlier announced that it has earmarked P20 billion for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, with Go also appealing to the government to allocate additional funds.
Go reminded concerned government agencies that they are expected to prioritize, coordinate, and report to the President and the Filipino people the developments on this issue of national importance.
“Patuloy po nating hinaharap ang epekto ng pandemya sa ating buhay. Bigyan natin ang ating mga kababayan ng balitang mas magpapalakas ng kanilang loob,’’ he added.

The Chinese government on Friday assuredthe Philippines that itwill be considered as a priority in getting the vaccine against COVID-19.
“And the Philippines as a close neighbor and friendly neighbor of China we will consider Philippines the priority once we successfully developed our vaccines,” Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said during an interview over CNN Philippines.
Citing the telephone conversation with President Duterte, Huang said Chinese President Xi Jinping has assured that “once we developed the vaccines we will make it as global public goods and make it affordable and accessible to all countries in the world especially for developing countries and our neighbors.”The ambassador said that according to scientists “it is likely that the vaccine could be developed by the end of this year or early next year.”
Among the 165 candidate vaccines listed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the ambassador noted that six have entered the final stages of clinical trials including four from Chinese pharmaceutical companies.
“All the clinical trials are doing quite well,” he said.
“We are quite optimistic that the vaccines will be developed in the near future after the third phase clinical trial,” he added.Of the four Chinese pharmaceutical companies, Huang said China National Biotec Group Co. Limited (CNBG) and Sinovac have been “engaging your government and institutions concerned for vaccine cooperation.”
The ambassador said the two Chinese firms started last June the last stages of the vaccine trials in the United Arab Emirates and Brazil.Huang assured China will continue to support Philippine efforts in fighting COVID-19.“We have been doing every effort to help the Philippines after the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Philippines in return to reciprocate what you have done to help China earlier this year,” he said.
So far, he noted, China has donated 10 million sets of personal protective equipment (PPE) and turned over 130 ventilators with 50 more arriving.
“We try to guarantee that kind of sufficient supplies of medical goods,” he said.
“And, of course, at the same time we try to reinvigorate, revitalize our projects of cooperation in the Philippines so that they contribute to your efforts to restart your economy,” he added.
Huang believes the country is on the right track in combatting COVID-19.“According to the assessment of the Chinese medical team who visited your country they feel that your measures are reasonable, comprehensive, and vigorous,” he said.
“We believe facing the challenge of COVID-19 the joint efforts of the people across this country you would be able to win over this fight, this battle at an early date,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The other three are made by the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna/NIAID and BioNTech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer, he added.The vaccines will be put into the general population for the first time in phase 3, after previous trials have focused on safety, immunogenicity, and immune response in a small number of humans, said the WHO official.
The phase-3 trial will test whether the vaccines can “protect large numbers of people over a prolonged period of time.”
However, “phase-3 doesn’t mean nearly there,” he said, as “there is no guarantee that any of these six will give us the answer.”

This is particularly crucial when it comes to COVID-19 — a disease that kills black people and Latinos twice as often as whites, according to US federal data.Eight out of ten deaths are among those over 65.By the end of this week, David Diemert, an infectious diseases doctor and professor of medicine at George Washington University, will start enrolling 500 people.
The process will take two months. Washington is one of 90 test sites nationwide for the mRNA vaccine developed by the National Institutes of Health and biotech Moderna.It will involve 30,000 people and take at least two years to fully complete, though its developers have said they hope to have preliminary results that could win an emergency use authorization within months.
“I’d say our main challenges are going to be enrolling that many people in a very short period of time, it’s much quicker than you’re normally used to,” said Diemert, who has overseen past vaccine trials into HIV and hookworm among other diseases.“We are aiming for individuals who are at greater risk of developing symptomatic COVID infection, so older people, and also people from communities of color.”
Past medical research in the United States has been plagued by focusing on homogeneous populations, skewing results, despite federal guidelines to include diverse groups, he said.
A study found that of 167 new medicines approved by the US between 2008 and 2013, about a fifth showed differences in response levels across ethnic groups.Another example: for many years clinicians relied on a diagnostic called Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, which was only validated among white women and drastically underestimated risk for black women who are more susceptible at younger ages.
Diemert added that, as a city with a 45 percent black population, Washington was an important site for investigation.
George Washington University teams therefore are going on recruitment drives — to testing centers, churches, and market places.
Part of their job is to try to win over trust in a community still leery toward drug research given the legacy of the Tuskegee experiments.In those, doctors intentionally did not treat black men with syphilis so they could study its progression in the 1932-1972 program.One thing Diemert wants people to know: according to earlier trial stages, the vaccine causes less severe side-effects in the elderly compared to young people, possibly as a result of less robust immune systems among the old.
The actual shot is two injections in the shoulder “just like you would get your regular flu shot,” spaced a month apart.
Leading the trial in the US capital is “both exciting and daunting,” added Diemert, given the world’s hopes for a swift return to normal.
“This is a good opportunity for people to contribute to their community in trying to put an end to this disease, and to participate in an altruistic way.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

US biotech company Novavax on Tuesday announced its experimental COVID-19 vaccine elicited a robust immune response, producing more antibodies than are present in recovered patients, and with generally tolerable side-effects in its early-stage trial.
The company was given $1.6 billion by the US government last month to develop and fund the drug under Operation Warp Speed — but in terms of timeline it is behind other firms including Moderna and AstraZeneca which have entered the final stages of their trials.
It reported in a press release that the phase one stage of its placebo-controlled trial involved 131 healthy adults aged 18-59 and two dose groups of five and 25 micrograms.Side effects included soreness at the site of injection, headache, fatigue and muscle pain. These were classified as mild to moderate, and none were severe.
After the first dose, all subjects who got the vaccine developed antibodies that block SARS-CoV-2’s “spike protein,” which it uses to latch on to human cells.
Most also developed “neutralizing antibodies” which are more potent and prevent viruses from infecting cells.
After a second dose given 28 days later, all participants had the more powerful neutralizing antibodies.Novavax reported that the lower dose performed comparably with the higher dose, which is important when it comes to mass production and because lower doses generally elicit fewer side effects.
Antibodies are infection-fighting proteins made by the immune system.Another part of the immune response comes in the form of T cells, types of white blood cells that have the capability to kill infected cells and which are increasingly thought to play an important role against COVID-19.Novavax said it looked for these cells in a subset of participants and found they were present.
The trial was supported by funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and was conducted at two sites inAustralia.
Novavax has not yet shared the detailed findings but said it was submitting the research for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and to medical preprint site medrxiv.org.The final stage Phase 3 trial of its vaccine, called NVX-CoV2373, is set to take place this fall.
The Maryland-based company grows synthesized pieces of the SARS-CoV-2’s “spike protein,” which triggers an immune response, inside insect cells in order to help scale up production.It also uses an “adjuvant,” a compound that boosts the production of neutralizing antibodies.
The company says the drug, which is a liquid formulation, can be stored at two degrees celsius to eight degrees celsius, refrigerator temperature.
In the spring, the company said it had proven the efficacy of a seasonal flu vaccine it had developed using the same technology. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In his public address on Sunday, the Presidentsaid the NPA and the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) do not have to respond to his declaration that he will allow them to get vaccinated as long as they behave.He added that he already asked the military to accommodate the communist rebels if they peacefully line up to get the shots.“If they (NPA) really want to get their shots (for) free, they can always line up. And I will ask now the military and the police to be forgiving,” Duterte said.
“‘Pag nakapila sila doon — wala namang armas (If they show up without their arms) — just to get the shots, give it to them. After that, if you go home, then we fight again but on even grounds. I want you to stay healthy because my soldiers are very, very healthy,” he added.
President Duterte said the military will be the first in line for the vaccine once it arrives in the country.
“They (soldiers) should be getting the first shots of the vaccine should we acquire them in due time,” he added.
Protest all you want
The President told the communist rebels and other protesters to protest all they want and they will even be allowed to stay on the streets despite the threat of COVID-19.
“If you want to protest, go ahead. I myself will sign the permit,” he said.
“‘Pag maghingi ka ng tatlong araw, magagalit ako. Gawain mong 10 araw.Diyan ka sa — magbabad kayo (I will be mad if you only ask for three days. Make it 10, stay there on the streets).

State-lenders Land Bank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) would provide loans to private companies planning to locally supply the coronavirus vaccines for commercial purposes.
Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said that qualified borrowers may tap the two government banks for the sale of any Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Dominguez said this financing option is aimed at complementing the national government’s COVID-19 immunization program that will cater only to 20 million Filipinos considered as poorest of the poor.
“They [Land Bank and DBP] can fund loans to qualified borrowers who wish to supply FDA-approved vaccines on a commercial basis,” Dominguez told reporters in a mobile phone message.Buoyed by the progress in the global race for the coronavirus vaccine, Dominguez said last Friday that the government will purchase P20 billion worth of vaccines once supplies become available. Under the initial plan unveiled by President Duterte, Land Bank and DBP will provide a P20 billion loan to Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC), the state-owned trading firm mandated to purchase the COVID-19 vaccines from overseas. The PITC will then sell the vaccines to the Department of Health (DOH) payable in several years. The P20 billion worth of COVID-19 vaccines, equivalent to 40 million doses, will be given for free to the poor beneficiaries.Currently, three pharmaceutical firms from China, a company from the United Kingdom, and another firm from the United States are expected to complete the third stage of the trials of their potential coronavirus vaccines by October.Dominguez said the two state-owned lenders can fully fund the estimated P20 billion budget for vaccines without support from the national government due to Land Bank and DBP’s strong balance sheets.He said Land Bank and DBP, being the third and ninth largest lenders in the country in terms of assets, respectively, will not get any additional capitalization from the national government to fund the loan. “The current balance sheets of both GFIs can support the estimated loan requirement of P20 billion. Please recall that since 2016—by hardly collecting any dividends from Land Band and DBP—the national government in effect strengthened their capital bases,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Duterte made the statement as he assured the public that there was nothing to worry about and that the vaccine may reach Philippine shores by December this year.
In his public address aired Friday, Duterte gave the responsibility of supervising the fair distribution and administration of the vaccines to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) but warned them to not cause any problem.“Mga pulis pakinggan ninyong mabuti ha: Ayaw ko nang — ayaw ko nang magkaatraso kayo dito. (To the cops, you better listen: I don’t want you to cause any trouble here),” he said.
“‘Pag kayo nagkaatraso, nagkamali, kulong talaga kayo (If you err here, I will send you to jail),” he added.
He even warned them to not sell the vaccines or he will hunt them down and “kill” them. The President has promised that the vaccine will be free and that the priority recipients are the beneficiaries of the government’s social amelioration program.
Meanwhile, Duterte called on nurses who are not working and volunteers to administer the vaccines in police stations and the military camps once they arrive.“May mga nurses ‘yan, and volunteers, I am asking, iyong mga nurse na walang trabaho (There should be nurses and volunteers there. I’m asking you, especially those who have no work now),” he said.
“Tutal bakuna na ito, hindi naman ito ‘yung may COVID. Basta mag-mask lang kayo and, of course, gloves (After all we’re talking about vaccines now and not COVID-19. Just wear your masks and, of course, gloves),” he added.
Duterte has expressed his admiration for the Chinese government after it publicly stated that the Philippines is one of its priority recipients of the COVID-19 vaccines it is developing.Last week, Duterte revealed that he appealed to President Xi Jinping to let the Philippines be one of the first vaccines to acquire their vaccines for COVID-19, a disease that originated from China.

The Philippines has two potential sources ofthe highly-coveted COVID-19 vaccine – the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility and China.
Most optimistic projections have the vaccine ready before 2020 ends.
FAIR DISTRIBUTION FOR ALLSeveral countries are concerned about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available, since countries with access might prioritize their own citizens before sharing it with the rest of the world, the reason why the COVAX Facility is strongly backed by the World Health Organization (WHO), since it is whereparticipating countries will be guaranteed fast and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
“COVAX is the only truly global solution to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “For the vast majority of countries, whether they can afford to pay for their own doses or require assistance, it means receiving a guaranteed share of doses and avoiding being pushed to the back of the queue, as we saw during the H1N1 pandemic a decade ago.”
Berkley explained that even countries able to purchase and secure their own vaccines directly from manufacturers will benefit from COVAX because the scheme reduces “the risks associated with individual candidates failing to show efficacy or gain licensure.”
Seventy-five countries have submitted expressions of interest to be a part of the COVAX Facility. According to WHO, these countries would finance the vaccines and partner with 90 lower-income countries that would be supported through voluntary donations to Gavi’s COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).The 165 countries, including the Philippines, will enjoy rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Once COVAX is fully financed, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that participating governments such as the Philippines will have its share of the vaccine.
The WHO said that the goal of COVAX is to deliver two billion doses of safe and effective medicine by the end of 2021. These vaccines must have passed regulatory approval and WHO prequalification.
The vaccines will be delivered to the participating countries, and the number of vaccines will be proportionate to their populations. Healthcare workers will be given priorities to the vaccines.Extra vaccine doses will be made available to any country based on its need, vulnerability, and COVID-19 threat. At the same time, the COVAX Facility will maintain a “buffer of doses” in case of emergencies and for humanitarian use.
WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swminathan gave COVAX her seal of approval.
“The COVID-19 pandemic, like every health crisis, also presents us with opportunities,” she said.“A vaccine that is affordable and accessible to all will help us address systemic health inequalities. We need all countries to support COVAX to achieve this goal and bring an end to the acute phase of the pandemic.”
Countries that have submitted expressions of interest to the facility are Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.
CHINA VACCINE
It seems the Philippines has all bases covered when it comes to the COVID-19 vaccine as China vowed to consider the country’s request to be given first priority.
A report from the Chinese Global Television Network said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin affirmed President Duterte’s remarks during the 2020 State-of-the-Nation Address (SONA) that China will give priority to its “friendly neighbor” should it succeed in developing a vaccine for COVID-19.
“Since the COVID-19 outbreak, China and the Philippines have been helping and supporting each other in the efforts to fight the pandemic, attesting to the mutual cooperation that has brought out a new highlight in bilateral relations,” said Wang. “We are willing to give priority to the vaccine request made by China’s friendly neighbor the Philippines.”
PROMISING VACCINE
There are two vaccines that are currently being developed that show much promise.
These are from Moderna Inc., which is based in Massachusetts, and Oxford University in England.
The University of Oxford vaccine appears to be leading the pack as its head scientist, Sarah Gilbert, said that it has an 80 percent probability of stopping people exposed to COVID-19 patients from developing the virus, according to Bloomberg Newsweek. Gilbert said she would know by September if that is indeed the case.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response and prevented the virus from replicating in the noses and lungs of monkeys.
The study said this prevention of the virus from replicating in the noses and lungs is crucial in the prevention against further spread of the virus.
The scientific journal The Lancet reported that Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine produces strong immune response.
Prof. Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford University and co-author of the study, said that Phase 1 and 2 data for their COVID-19 vaccine showed no “unexpected reactions.” However, they must still continue with their “rigorous clinical trial program” in order to confirm the vaccine in humans.
Oxford is working hand-in-hand with the UK-based global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to mass-produce the vaccines and eventual distribution. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso made the announcement on his Facebook Live on Friday night (July 31) and said that he has asked the city council, led by Vice Mayor Honey Lacuña, to prepare for the “end game.”
“The city government, and the vice mayor, and I talked already [about] our next plan in the coming months and hopefully, December,” Domagoso said.“Just so you know, your local government is already preparing… so Vice Mayor Lacuña and the councilors would be able to come up with an ordinance appropriating funds for the purchase of an upcoming COVID-19 vaccine… so we could give them for free to the Batang Maynila [Manila residents],” he added in mixed English and Filipino.
The local chief executive did not disclose the name of the company which is nearing approval to roll out the vaccine, but said that it is a big and well-known company.
He said they will directly purchase vaccines from that company if the local government will be allowed to do so.
Domagoso, however, clarified that there is still no completely approved vaccine and that his recommendation to appropriate a budget is only part of the city’s preparations. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The government’s roadmap for recovery will depend on the national budget and the availability of the coronavirus vaccine, according to President Duterte.
President Rodrigo Roa Duterte (SIMEON CELI JR./PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
In his televised address Friday, the President admitted that he was unable to dwell on such roadmap until these two factors are ensured.
Duterte made the statement after he was widely criticized for the supposed missing detailed roadmap to ride out the pandemic during his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA) last Monday.“Sabihin niyo wala kaming roadmap. The roadmap ng recovery natin — I do not know din ‘yung headline niyang newspaper. Sabi ko nga hindi ako nagbabasa ng newspaper eh. The roadmap… If it’s about me, I do not read. “Duterte, where is your roadmap?” Hindi nga kami maka-roadmap because we were talking about a budget. Ito, ito ngayong gabing ito (You said we have no roadmap to recovery. I do not know but the headline of the newspaper — I said I don’t read newspapers if it’s about me — read ‘Duterte where is your roadmap?’ We cannot craft the roadmap because we are talking about the budget tonight),” Duterte said.
“I could not have uttered a single sentence about roadmap to recovery kasi ang una talaga diyan ang medicine (because first we also need the medicine),” he said.
The President has highlighted the progress in development of coronavirus vaccines, citing the efforts made by foreign drug companies.Duterte said he hopes the vaccine can be available by December so people can start returning to their normal lives.He intends to buy the vaccines and give free medicines to the poor, the middle income, soldiers and policemen.
On the proposed national budget, the President met with the economic team on the matter before his public address, according to his spokesman Harry Roque.The proposed 2021 national budget was not submitted to Congress in time for the President’s SONA. The P4.3 trillion spending proposal is reportedly still being finalized by the budget department.
The President recently drew criticisms from several lawmakers and groups for allegedly failing to present a concrete plan to fight the pandemic and jumpstart the economy during his recent SONA.
Malacañang hit back at critics, saying they were probably deaf when the President called for the passage of the proposed Bayanihan 2 law and tackled programs such as loan assistance for affected industries.In his SONA before the joint session of Congress, the President tackled several issues including possible state takeover of telecommunication firms over their supposed bad service, tirade against Senator Franklin Drilon,and his being a “casualty” of ABS-CBN network during the 2016 elections.
He said the country is in a better fiscal position to weather the crisis but he remained reluctant to further open up the economy due to possible spike in infections. He also pushed for the swift passage of several priority bills such as death penalty for drug-related offenses. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Senator Christopher “Bong” Go today urged anew the Department of Health (DOH) and other concerned agencies to prepare a national coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine program in order to ensure the accessibility and affordability of the vaccine, once it is made available, even to the poorest of the poor and, most especially, to the vulnerable sectors.Sen. Bong Go (Senate of the Philippines / MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
Once the vaccine and medicines for COVID-19 are available, we should be prepared to provide all Filipinos who need them, especially the poor,’’ Go, chairman of the Senate health and demography committee, said.
Go warned that difficult decisions would have to be made once a vaccine is available.Hence, the need to already plan and anticipate possible scenarios in order to ensure that the vaccine can be accessible to those who need it the most, he said.“Huwag sana pabayaan ang mga mahihirap. Paghandaan na natin ngayon palang. Magtabi na tayo ng budget para masigurong kakayanin ng gobyerno na matulungan ang mga mahihirap. Magkaroon po tayo ng plano kung saan dapat pantay-pantay at hindi lang ang mga may kaya sa buhay ang makakakuha,’’ he explained. (The poor should not be left behind. We should prepare as early as now to ensure that the government can afford to help the poor. Let’s have a plan wherein everybody will be treated equally and not only the rich can have access to [the vaccine and medicines].)In his recent speech during the virtual launch of the country’s 77th Malasakit Center in Guimaras, Go also said that preparations for the availability of the vaccine are already being discussed and developed by the country’s health officials and finance managers.“Nagkausap po kami ni (Finance) Secretary (Carlos)Dominguez kahapon at gagawan na po nila ng paraan. Once available ‘yung vaccine ay handa po ‘yung gobyerno para bumili ng vaccine,’’ he said. (I have talked to Secretary Dominguez yesterday and he informed me that they’re now finding ways and means [to produce the funds needed]. Once the vaccine is available, the government must be ready to purchase it.)Go stressed that once a vaccine is available, no one should be left behind when it comes to access.
President Rodrigo Duterte, in his address to the people today, appealed to the public to cooperate and trust the government as necessary measures are already being implemented while the availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 is still being studied by scientists and health experts.President Duterte said the Philippines would likely get COVID-19 vaccines first from China, as he noted that developments of different vaccines are also underway.On distribution of vaccines once it is available, the President also reiterated, “Ang mauna ‘yung walang-wala… tsaka ‘yung mga nasa hospital… ‘Yung pangalawa, middle income. Libre ito, hindi ko ito ipagbili…. (The first to get it will be the poor…and those in the hospitals….comes second are the milddle income earners. This is for free. I will not sell it…)”Dominguez also said that the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) would help in the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.Dominguez explained that the country might need to vaccinate for free a minimum of 20 million people.
“If one to two shots are needed, that is around 40 million doses and at around $10 per dose, that is $400 M or P20 billion,” according to the finance secretary who added that the economy is already beginning to recover from its lowest point last April to May. “Wala tayong problema sa liquidity. May pera (We have no problem in liquidity. There is money). Inflation is within target.

President Duterte tapped the military as an “implementing arm” in the distribution of the potential vaccine maintaining local government officials may “politicize” the process.
Outgoing AFP Chief, General Felimon Santos Jr., has already instructed his men to set up a distribution plan.“Bagaman at kababanggit pa lang ng Pangulo ang tungkol sa bagay na ‘yan, kaagad pong inatasan ng ating AFP Chief of Staff General Felimon Santos Jr. ang kanyang mga staff upang pagpaplanuhan at paghandaan ‘yan before December kung kailan pinaniniwalaan na magkakaroon na ng vaccine para sa COVID-19 (While the President recently discussed the matter, AFP Chief of Staff General Felimon Santos Jr. immediately ordered his staff to plan and prepare for it before December, when the vaccine for COVID-19 will likely be made available),” said Major General Edgard Arevalo, AFP spokesperson.
“Ikinatutuwa po natin ang malaking tiwala sa AFP ng ating Commander-in-Chief (We are glad with the immense trust of our Commander-in-Chief with the AFP),” Arevalo added.
Duterte is pinning his hopes China will make a vaccine available before the year ends.
He also thanked the Chinese government for promising to prioritize the Philippines once a vaccine becomes available.
The President has relied heavily on the military and the police in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic since it began early this year.
He appointed ex-generals to lead government task forces which are responsible for the COVID-19 response, and asked the military to use its assets to haul medical supplies, equipment and personnel to and from abroad.
Military personnel were also told to secure quarantine checkpoints when community quarantine was enforced in March to control the spread of the virus, and help social workers in distributing cash aid to communities.The AFP also sent medical personnel in isolation facilities to augment the Department of Health’s workforce, and in areas with high COVID-19 cases such as in Cebu City to control the surge of infections.

Senators on Friday urged the government to proceed with caution on its plan to purchase and distribute COVID-19 vaccines once they are available.
President Duterte, in a taped address aired Friday morning, announced his plan for a mass immunization program for coronavirus. An initial fund of P20 billion will be allocated for the procurement of the COVID-19 vaccines that will be given for free to the poor and the sick.
Senator Joel Villanueva said coronavirus vaccines are still undergoing the World Health Organization’s (WHO) evaluation and that there are risks involved with developing them in haste.The WHO said that as of July 27, 25 candidate vaccines are under various stages of clinical evaluation with at least five of them in the third phase of the clinical trials.
“Not to be overly optimistic, we wish that there will be transparency in the experimental results of these vaccines,” Villanueva said.
“We know the urgency to have a vaccine as soon as possible but there are risks attached to fast tracking the development of vaccines that normally takes 10 years to produce,” he added.
He urged the Food and Drug Administration to “exercise rigor in approving the vaccines that will be available for us.”Villanueva added that “no one should be discriminated against from accessing the vaccine.”
“It’s the obligation of the State to support the right to health,” he said.
Senator Francis Pangilinan said that President Duterte should fire Health Secretary Francisco Duque III before implementing his free vaccine distribution plan.
“Before we even begin to take the President’s plan seriously, he should fire Duque. His (Duterte) proposals to address COVID rings hollow and empty when he condones incompetence and corruption and when his team continues to miss their targets for mass testing, contact tracing, and treatment, and in doing so has miserably failed to stop the spread of the disease,” Pangilinan said.The opposition senator has been firm in his call for Duque’s resignation. He recently voted against the passage of the proposed Bayanihan 2 law in the Senate as he stood pat that Duque should step down before additional funds are released to the Department of Health (DOH) for its COVID-19 response.
Early this month, the DOH said the country is set to participate in the clinical trials for five candidate vaccines for COVID-19 from China and Taiwan. The DOH is also preparing for its participation in the WHO’s Solidarity Trials for Vaccine.SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Duterte made the statement amid high hopes the vaccine to the dreaded viral illness may be available before the end of the year.“Yung mga NPA pabakunahan ko ba? If you stop fighting for a while during the period or until December kasi my soldiers will be busy monitoring, supervising, huwag lang ninyo galawin, pwede kayong sumali at pumila doon (Will I let the NPA be vaccinated? If you stop fighting for a while during the period or until December because my soldiers will be busy monitoring, supervising, do not harm them and you may join and fall in line),” Duterte said.
“Even if you announce that you are an NPA, it’s okay. Pagamot ka muna o pa-vaccinate ka, para mahusay kang lumaban sa puwersa ko (Have yourself treated or vaccinated so you can have the strength to fight government forces),” he added.
Duterte, however, made it clear that his pronouncement was not a declaration of a unilateral ceasefire with the communist rebels.
He said he made the appeal to “allow the normal process of helping the country.”Duterte said he is ready to help the rebels “as a matter of humanity because it is not our money, and because you are a Filipino.”
“Post-COVID na tayo mag-away ulit (Let’s fight again post-COVD). I am just telling you, stop it and allow the normal process of helping the country,” he said.
The President has remained hopeful about the potential coronavirus vaccine by December, citing the efforts in vaccine development by China. He appreciated China’s gesture to prioritize the country’s request for vaccine access.Once the coronavirus vaccines are available, the government plans to purchase the supply and prioritize the poorest of the poor in the vaccination program.
Duterte said he wants the military to supervise the vaccine distribution program “to remove partisanship, favoritism, and petty corruption.” “However you do it, I don’t care. I just want unified monitoring and supervising. We intend to vaccinate every Filipino for that matter,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The proposed fund allocation comes after President Duterte presented the government’s plan to prioritize the country’s poorest of the poor for the coronavirus immunization program.Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said Friday that the Land Bank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) can fully fund the estimated ₱20-billion budget for vaccines without support of the national government due to Land Bank and DBP’s strong balance sheets.
Under plan, Land Bank and DBP, two government financial institutions (GFIs), will provide a loan to the Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC), the state-owned company mandated by President Duterte to purchase COVID-19 vaccines from overseas.Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon M. Lopez said the ₱20 billion worth of vaccines is just an initial batch.“The GFIs will fund PITC’s purchase with a term loan for the purchase of the vaccines identified by the DOH [Department of Health].PITC will sell the vaccines to the DOH. The DOH will pay PITC over time from their future allocations from the national budget,” Dominguez said.
“We can pay that over maybe two or three years. So they will pay the financing companies which are Land Bank and DBP. These can finance the purchase of the vaccines which will be about ₱20 billion,” he added.He said Land Bank and DBP, being the third and ninth largest lenders in the country in terms of assets, respectively, will not get any additional capitalization from the national government to fulfil the President’s directive.“The current balance sheets of both GFIs can support the estimated loan requirement of ₱20 billion. In his taped public address, the President welcomed the progress in vaccine development, particularly expressing appreciation for China’s offer to prioritize the Philippines’ access to the vaccine and medicines. Once the vaccine is available, Duterte said the government will purchase these and tap the military to help in the distribution.Read more: AFP ready to assist in COVID vaccine distribution
“I promise you by the grace of God, I hope by December we will be back to normal. Don’t expect the new normal because I said when we started, let us just wait for the vaccine,” Duterte said.“Just wait by December if you can be patient. Because if you keep going out and get infection, you’ll end up dead,” he said.Under his free vaccine distribution plan, Duterte said the poor beneficiaries of the government’s subsidy program will be the first to benefit.The middle-income people as well as soldiers, policemen, and uniformed personnel will also be entitled to the free coronavirus vaccines.
Excluded from the government’s distribution list are the country’s rich “who can buy their own vaccine” as well as the “drug pushers and drug addicts,” according to the President.“Those who have nothing will be the first beneficiaries and of course those in the hospitals, the sick, and dying. We will prioritize the people on the list of those getting assistance from the government,” the President said.“’Yung mga mayaman, huwag na ninyong – huwag na ninyo akong isipin kasi hindi ako nag-iisip sa inyo. Sorry na lang. Kayo kung makaafford (To the rich, don’t think of me because I don’t think about you. Sorry. You can already afford),” he added.Duterte said he would ask Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and the military to implement the distribution of the coronavirus vaccines to the rightful beneficiaries.“Libre ito. Hindi ko ito ipagbili (This is for free. I won’t sell it),” he said. In the meeting with some Cabinet members, the President asked Dominguez to discuss how the government will finance the vaccine acquisition program. Dominguez said the government could provide vaccines for free initially for 20 million people as estimated by the Department of Health.The DOF chief said three pharmaceutical firms from China, a company from the United Kingdom, and another firm from the United States are expected to complete the third stage of the trials of their potential coronavirus vaccines by October.“Before December most likely ma-a-approve na po ‘yun ng mga FDA nila, ‘yung Food and Drug Administration. So when that happens ho, ang Department of Health ang mamili kung anong tamang bakuna ang bibilhin (Before December, mostly like their Food and Drug Administrations (FDAs) will approve them. When that happens, the Department of Health will choose the right vaccine to be purchased),” Dominguez said.“Ang estimate ho ng Department of Health, we will need to vaccinate for free a minimum of 20 million people ‘di ba? So I don’t know if it’s one vaccine or two shots, two shots. So we need – so 40 million vaccines – doses, 40 million doses. Ang 40 million doses times roughly 10 dollars per dose ‘di ba is 400 million dollars or roughly 20 billion pesos,” he said.Dominguez said if the vaccine costs $10 per dose, the pharmaceutical firms may sell the medicine around ₱1,200 to include the service and transportation of the product.“That’s totally available, the financing is available for this program,” he added.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday cautioned the public against supposed vaccine products claiming to be effective in preventing or treating the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
FDA Director-General Rolando Enrique Domingo
said there remains no approved vaccine for the said respiratory illness.“Pag meron po kayong nakita na nagbebenta ng bakuna, sigurado pong fake po iyon, hindi po iyon bakuna para sa COVID-19. [If you see someone selling a supposed vaccine, it is definitely fake, it is not a vaccine for COVID-19],” said Domingo in a press briefing.
“Kung meron po kayong makita sa Facebook, sa social media, o kahit na anong text–ipaalam niyo po agad sa FDA. [If you find anything on Facebook, on social media, or even text (messages)—report it immediately to the FDA],” he added.The pronouncement of Domingo was also echoed by Department of Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.“Wala pa talagang bakuna.

US biotech firm Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response and prevented the coronavirus from replicating in the noses and lungs of monkeys, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine said Tuesday.

The fact that the vaccine prevented the virus from replicating in the nose is seen as particularly crucial in preventing it from being transmitted onward to others.The same outcome did not occur when the University of Oxford’s vaccine was tested on monkeys, though that vaccine did prevent the virus from entering the animals’ lungs and making them very sick.In the Moderna animal study, three groups of eight rhesus macaques received either a placebo or the vaccine at two different dose levels — 10 micrograms and 100 micrograms.
All vaccinated macaques produced high levels of neutralizing antibodies that attack a part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus used to invade cells.
Notably, monkeys receiving both dose levels produced these antibodies at levels higher than those found in humans who have recovered from COVID-19.
The authors reported that the vaccine also induced the production of a different immune cell known as T-cells that may have helped boost the overall response.A major area of concern is that vaccines under development could actually backfire by amplifying rather than suppressing the disease.
So-called vaccine-associated enhancement of respiratory disease (VAERD) has been linked to the production of a specific type of T-cell known as Th2 — but these cells were not produced during the experiment, suggesting this vaccine won’t backfire.
Four weeks after the monkeys received their second injection, they were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, both through the nose and directly to the lungs via a tube.After two days, no replicating virus was detected in the lungs of seven of the eight macaques in both the low and high dose groups.
By contrast, all eight in the placebo group continued to have the virus present.
None of the eight macaques in the high dose groups had detectable levels of virus in their noses two days after exposure.“This is the first time an experimental COVID-19 vaccine tested in nonhuman primates has been shown to produce such rapid viral control in the upper airway,” said the National Institutes for Health, which co-developed the vaccine.
A COVID-19 vaccine capable of stopping the virus in the lungs will prevent the disease from becoming severe, while stopping the virus from replicating in the nose would lessen transmission.The Moderna vaccine uses genetic material in the form of viral RNA to encode the information needed to grow the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inside the human body to trigger an immune response.
Spike proteins give coronaviruses their crown-like appearance and are used to invade human cells, but by themselves are thought to be relatively harmless.
The advantage of this technology is that it bypasses the need to manufacture viral proteins in the lab, helping to ramp up mass production.
Both Moderna’s vaccine and the vaccine co-developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have entered late-stage human trials. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

US President Donald Trump vowed to defeat the coronavirus by “unleashing American scientific genius” as he toured a COVID-19 vaccine facility in the swing state of North Carolina on Monday.

Trump appears to have pinned his hopes on the swift emergence of a successful vaccine to both contain the country’s still raging epidemic and revive his faltering re-election hopes.“We will achieve a victory over the virus by unleashing American scientific genius,” he told reporters at Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies in Morrisville, hours after it was revealed national security advisor Robert O’Brien had tested positive.
The facility has been awarded a contract to mass produce an experimental vaccine developed by Novavax, as part of a multi-billion dollar government initiative dubbed Operation Warp Speed.
The plan involves investing heavily in leading pharmaceuticals to aid their development and manufacturing efforts, with the goal of delivering 300 million doses of vaccine by January 2021.
It’s “never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work, and work very well,” added Trump, who later donned a black mask and toured the lab.The United States is by far the worst-hit country in the world, with more than 4.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and nearly 150,000 deaths.
Though the number of new cases has leveled off over the past few days, the US has failed to push its curve down as other nations have done through lockdowns and physical distancing.
Trump’s latest comments confirmed that the administration believes that, in America’s case, only a vaccine can help.“It’s not masks. It’s not shutting down the economy. Hopefully, it is American ingenuity that will allow for therapies and vaccines to ultimately conquer this,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told ABC News on Sunday.
The virus has also repeatedly penetrated Trump’s inner circle, with O’Brien the latest and most senior White House aide to test positive.
He “has been self-isolating and working from a secure location off site,” the White House said in a statement Monday, adding that there was “no risk of exposure to the president or the vice president.”
Others who have been previously infected include Vice President Mike Pence’s spokeswoman Katie Miller, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a top fundraiser for the Trump campaign and his elder son’s girlfriend.
Results by November?
The US has spent more than $6.3 billion since March to fund vaccine development efforts under Operation Warp Speed.The program is unabashed in its aims to procure vaccines for the American people first — unlike European leaders who have called for COVID-19 drugs to be a “global public good.”
Pharmaceutical newcomer Moderna, which, alongside AstraZeneca and two Chinese firms is among those furthest in its development timeline, began the final stage of its clinical trial Monday.
The trial is being co-conducted by the National Institutes for Health (NIH) across the United States and is expected to enroll approximately 30,000 adult volunteers.
Participants will get two doses of the vaccine given 28 days apart.
The first volunteer, a Black woman identified as Robyn, participated in a video chat hosted by the NIH on Monday, telling viewers her friends and relatives had initially told her “it was a bad idea.”
“And the reason for that was because in the African American community, we are all familiar with the Tuskegee experiments,” she added, referring to a 40-year-study the US conducted on Black men to see the effects of untreated syphilis.
The men involved were kept in the dark about cures on purpose.
But, added Robyn, she was encouraged by laws that are now in place to prevent a repetition, and motivated by the desire to help others against a disease that disproportionately impacts communities of color.
An irony of the process is that, given the rampant nature of the US epidemic, results could come far sooner than the two years the trial is set to run.
Daily new cases have plateaued around the 66,000 mark for the past few days, making it more likely that trial participants will be exposed to the virus sooner rather than later.
“It’s a really optimistic scenario. It could be November,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC on Monday. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

President Duterte revealed that he recently asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to allow the Philippines to be one of the first countries to get their hands on a vaccine against COVID-19.
Pres. Rodrigo Duterte
Duterte made the statement as he delivered his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday.
In his speech, the President acknowledged that every country, including the Philippines, is living in troubled times because of the pandemic.“Our dream of prosperity for our country was suddenly snuffed by a pandemic virulent virus. No nation was spared. Neither rich nor poor were exempt from the onslaught of this deadly disease,” he said.
However, President Duterte assured Filipinos that they do not have to wait much longer for a vaccine as it will be coming soon even though it would be difficult to access.
“But let us not despair. The vaccine is around the corner. Sooner and not later, the virus that gobbled up thousands of lives will itself be laid to rest,” he said.
“How to get it (vaccine) from the producers or other governments is really something which we have to deal with it because everyone… It’s a global need and everyone will go for it,” he added.According to President Duterte, he already asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to allow the Philippines to have first dibs on their vaccine.
“About four days ago I made a plea to President Xi Jinping that if they have the vaccine, can they allow us to be one of the first, or if needed, if we have to buy it, that we will be granted credit so that we can normalize as fast as possible,” he said.
President Xi had assured President Duterte that the Philippines will be among the first countries to get a vaccine against COVID-19, once it is developed. The China National Pharmaceutical Group (SinoPharm) said last week that a vaccine could be ready by the end of 2020.Last week, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said it does not matter how much will these vaccines cost or who makes them because Duterte’s friends-to-all-enemies-to-none foreign policy will help the Philippines secure vaccines.
“Tayo po ay may independent foreign policy at dahil po diyan, dahil kaibigan tayo ng lahat–ng China, ng Russia, ng America, ng Europa—na kung sino man ang maka-develop ng vaccine ay tayo po ay tinuturing na kaibigan nila. (We have an independent foreign policy where we are friends with everyone–China, Russia, America, Europe—so whoever develops a vaccine, we’re friends with them),” he said.
President Duterte has said that he was willing to sell all government assets to buy vaccines for COVID-19. However, Roque said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III is against this.
Countries like China, the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom have all reported positive developments in their quest for a COVID-19 vaccine.
On Friday, the Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases allowed the Philippines to join the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.Gavi has announced that 75 countries have submitted expressions of interest to protect their populations and those of other nations through joining the COVAX Facility.
The 75 countries, which would finance the vaccines from their own public finance budgets, partner with up to 90 lower-income countries that could be supported through voluntary donations to Gavi’s COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).
Among the group are representatives from every continent and more than half of the world’s G20 economies.
COVAX aims to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or World Health Organization (WHO) pre-qualification by the end of 2021.
In a statement, Gavi said that the vaccines will be delivered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritizing healthcare workers then expanding to cover 20 percent of the population of participating countries. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The China National Pharmaceutical Group (SinoPharm) said this week that a vaccine could be ready by the end of 2020.Studies published in The Lancet medical journal showed that two COVID-19 vaccine candidates have proven safe for humans and produced strong immune reactions among patients involved in two separate clinical trials.The first trial among more than a thousand adults in Britain found that the vaccine induced ‘strong antibody and T cell immune responses’ against the novel coronavirus while a separate trial in China involving more than 500 people showed most had developed widespread antibody immune response.Meanwhile, while the world raced to secure COVID-19 vaccines before they are even ready, the United States government has announced a $1.95-billion contract with Pfizer and a German biotechnology company BioNTech for 100 million doses by December.Russia, on the other hand, said its first vaccine against COVID-19 was “ready” after two groups of volunteers have successfully completed clinical trials with all of them having “built up immunity.”SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Two Chinese nationals have been indicted for seeking to steal COVID-19 vaccine research and intellectual property from hundreds of companies in the United States and other countries, the US Justice Department said Tuesday.
Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, also targeted human rights activists in the United States, China and Hong Kong, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said.
The hackers, who are believed to be in China beyond the reach of US law enforcement, acted in some instances “for their own personal gain” and in others for the benefit of China’s Ministry of State Security, Demers said at a press conference.“Cybercrimes directed by the Chinese government’s intelligence services not only threaten the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law,” FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said.
US Attorney William Hyslop said the hackers targeted companies worldwide.
“The computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen,” Hyslop said.
The Justice Department said the targets of the hackings included “hundreds of victim companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activists in the United States and abroad, including Hong Kong and China.”SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“At cost price that will be about 2.5 euros ($2.8) per unit.“We hope to be able to produce a vaccine by the end of the year… perhaps a little earlier if all goes well” on the back of phase three results expected in the autumn, Soriot added in an interview.
Early results of a closely watched Phase 1/2 trial published this week in The Lancet suggest the vaccine candidate is safe and induces an immune response.
US group Johnson & Johnson has also vowed to deliver a vaccine at “non-profit” pricing.
In contrast rivals Pfizer, Merck and Moderna confirmed Tuesday to US lawmakers they would not sell vaccine at cost.Soriot said the vaccine had performed well in stage 1 and 2 trials suggesting it offered good tolerability without serious side effects.
Stage 3 trials will now be carried out on a wider sample before product can finally be rolled out.
“We are working hand in hand with the regulators, we exchange our data on a daily basis to enable very swift evaluation. We are carrying out clinical trials which allows us to gain time,” said Soriot.He added the group had begun to produce product in “a number of regions” so they would be ready to start delivering “if the clinical trials are positive.”
A separate trial in Wuhan, China, where the disease first emerged late last year and involving more than 500 people, showed most had developed widespread antibody immune response.The race is on in labs across the world to win the race to produce a vaccine to deal with the world health crisis the world has seen in a century.
More than 200 candidate vaccines are being developed with 23 having progressed to clinical trials with human volunteers. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A Chinese-made vaccine against the new coronavirus entered the final stage of testing Tuesday in Brazil, where volunteers received the first doses of what officials hope will be a game-changer in the global pandemic.

The vaccine, developed by private Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech, became the third in the world to enter Phase 3 clinical trials, or large-scale testing on humans — the last step before regulatory approval.
“We’re living in unique and historic times, and that’s why I wanted to be part of this trial,” said the 27-year-old doctor who received the first dose at the Clinical Hospital of Sao Paulo.Her name was withheld for confidentiality.
Around 9,000 health workers across six Brazilian states will receive the vaccine, known as CoronaVac, in two doses over the next three months under the study.
Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria said Monday initial results were expected within 90 days.
Sinovac is partnering with a Brazilian public health research center, the Butantan Institute, on the trials.If the vaccine proves safe and effective, the institute will have the right to produce 120 million doses under the deal, according to officials.
Brazil is the second-hardest-hit country in the coronavirus pandemic, after the United States.
Its death toll surpassed 80,000 Monday, and it has registered 2.1 million infections.Because the virus is still spreading quickly in the South American country, it is seen as an ideal testing ground for vaccine candidates.
Brazil is also helping carry out Phase 3 testing of another experimental vaccine, developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.
It has a similar deal to produce that vaccine domestically if it is successful in tests, which are also being carried out in Britain and South Africa.
Brazilian health regulators announced Monday they have also authorized Phase 1, 2 and 3 trials of two more vaccines, developed by US firm Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech.
Researchers worldwide are racing to develop and test a vaccine for the virus. There are more than 150 projects so far.Studies published Monday in British medical journal The Lancet found two vaccine candidates were safe and produced an immune response in Phase 2 trials: the Oxford vaccine and another Chinese-made vaccine, developed by pharmaceutical firm CanSino Biologics and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology.

The Chinese Embassy in Manila on Tuesday assured that China will give priority to the Philippines, in the name of “global public good,” once a vaccine against COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is developed and put into use.
Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian made this assurance as he seeks to expand cooperation between the two governments in the areas of health, smooth flow of goods and people, economic and social recoveries, and sustainable growth.“When the COVID-19 vaccine is developed and put into use, China will give priority to providing it to the Philippines, as a global public good,” Huang said.
Huang said China and the Philippines, along with other Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) partner countries, have accelerated their cooperation in the field of public health, and are committed to building a “Health Silk Road” and a community of common health for mankind.Following the outbreak, Huang said China is working through various channels to fully support the Philippines’ resistance to the virus, including the dispatch of its medical experts to Manila at the onset of the enhanced community quarantine period.A report on Monday revealed that the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research of Bangladesh and Chinese company and inventor Sinovac Research and Development Limited will begin the Phase III clinical trial of a Chinese vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19.While awaiting the vaccine, Huang said the Chinese government has so far provided the Philippines with a total of 252,000 testing reagents, 130 ventilators, 1.87 million medical masks, protective suits, goggles, and other epidemic prevention materials.In addition, he said a large number of Chinese local governments, enterprises, and civil groups donated millions of PPEs and other medical supplies to different local governments and hospitals of the Philippines.
To hasten and strengthen other areas of cooperation, both China and the Philippines have been negotiating for the establishment of the “fast track” for two-way essential travel and a “green channel” for smooth flow of goods to ensure the stability of the industrial and supply chains.
At the same time, Huang said the two countries are continuing to synergize the BRI with the Philippines’ “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure program, and steadily carry out major cooperation projects in infrastructure construction to further consolidate and upgrade the relations.“As the resumption of work and production proceeds in an orderly manner, there will be more Chinese-financed projects in the Philippines which will inject strong impetus to the local economic recovery and improvement of people’s livelihood,” he said.
The top Chinese diplomat in Manila likewise assured that the two countries are making every effort to accelerate work resumption and help the public return to their normal lives. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The President said he intends to raise funds to procure 110 million vaccines to immunize all Filipinos from the disease as he welcomed the advancement in the clinical trials of coronavirus vaccine abroad.
“As a matter of fact, I would need about 110 million para mapainom ko sa lahat para… Ang COVID nandiyan pa pero maging inutil na… they remain on the air but we are immunized already so maghintay lang kayo nang kaunti (As a matter of fact I would need about 110 million for the people.

But if there is a thing that develops which is really good for you, mauna ako — mag-utang ako. Magpabili ako kung saan magpabili ng lupa para ipagbili ko ng — ibili ko ng medisina (For our plans, put it something like towards the end of the year. But if there is a thing that develops which is really good, I’ll be the first. I will borrow money. I will sell properties to buy medicines),” he added.
Duterte said the clinical trials for the coronavirus vaccine are in the final stages, citing progress in Russia, China, and the United States.
“Actually ang ipinangako ko sa inyo kung mayroon ng vaccine. Mayroon na, final trial. Sa Russia, binitawan na nila. I’m sure China has already one, ang Amerika (Actually I made a promise to you that if there will be a vaccine, there is one. The trials are in the final stages. In Russia, they released it.

House Committee on Health chairwoman QuezonRep.Angelina “Helen” Tan asked the government on Sunday to prepare the funds for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines should it become available in the global market.
She said as early as now,the national government should start looking for funds to ensure that the 107 million Filipinos have access to the vaccine.
“No. 1one requirement , siyempre ‘yung funds,‘yung pondo kasi ang vaccine naman, especially ang demand ay globally, so makikipag-agawan tayo sa ibang bansa. Mahalaga at this time napro-project na natin, kung paano natin pinaghandaan, for example ang Social Amelioration Program nawalang maiiwan, especiallythe vulnerable sectors.So ngayon pa lang hinahanda na natin,nakakapaghanda tayo (The No. 1 requirement is definitely funds,there will be global demand for vaccine, so we will compete with other countries. It is important that at this time,we already have our own projection, the way we prepared, for example, Social Amelioration Program that no one will be left behind, especiallythe vulnerable sectors. As early as now,we should prepare for it,we started our preparations),” she said in an interview over DZBB.She urged the government to gauge whether or notit has the capacity to provide the vaccines to all Filipinos and determine the sectors who will first receive the COVID-19 vaccination.
“Kung talagang ang madevelop na vaccine ay puwedeng ibigay sa kahit anong edad,lahat siyempre gustong makakuha ng bakuna, pero kaya ba natin na magbigay nang sabay sabay? Darating ang pagkakataon na may kailangan kang unahin at may iprioritize ka (If a vaccine that will be developed can be given to all ages,given that all wanted to avail it, can you simultaneously give it to all? There comes a point that you have to prioritize),” Tan said.
“So ngayon, dapat sila, duon sa atin sa Executive,tinitingnan na ‘yan so that dumating ang panahon na available na, implementation na lang, ready na tayo hindi ‘yung kelan dumating saka maghahanap tayo pondo, sino makakatangap, ilan sila, things like that (So now, the Executive should look into it so that once the vaccine becomes available, we just focus on the implementation, we are ready, we shouldn’t scramble for funds when the vaccine is already here, identify those who will receive,how many of them,things like that),” she said.
The House leader said the government should now manage the people’s expectations, considering that all would like to avail the vaccine to protect themselves from the dreaded disease.
“I am sure it will create chaos, dahil lahat ng tao may clamor na gusto nilang magpabakuna dahil gustung gusto natin na lumabas talaga (All have clamor to have themselves vaccinated) . ‘Yung fear na nararamadaman ng tao sa COVID (The fear being felt by the people due to COVID)dahil nga ang binabanggit ay (because it was mentioned) hindi tayobabalik sa normal hangga’t walang bakuna (we will not return to normalcy until there is no vaccine).

As the global race for the development of an anti-COVID-19 vaccine heated on the positive side, the chairperson of the House Committee on Health vowed Thursday to eliminate legal impediments against the immediate procurement of the vaccine.
(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
Quezon Rep. Helen Tan said under Republic Act 11223 or the Universal Health Care Act, stringent measures were set before new medicines and vaccines could be procured in the country.
Tan noted that the law provides that “each intervention must have undergone Phase IV clinical trial, and systematic review and meta-analysis must be readily available. The interventions must also not pose any harm to the users and health care providers.”“As such, only vaccines, including drugs and medicines which have undergone Phase IV clinical trial and systematic review and meta-analysis, can be used for any population-based intervention,” she said.
Tan noted that although Phase IV clinical trial is an important component that could ensure the safety of pharmaceutical drug or medical device, such post marketing surveillance requirement “may limit the country’s access to any breakthrough drugs and medicines.”
“As one of the principal authors of the UHC law, I fully recognize the need to relax the post marketing surveillance requirement or Phase IV clinical trial as provided under the UHC law in times of public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said.
Tan vowed to propose an exemption from the law in the procurement of newly-developed vaccines and interventions aimed at addressing the rising 2019 coronavirus infection among Filipinos.
This can be done by putting such provision in the proposed “Bayanihan to Recover As One Act” or Bayanihan 2 that will be taken up soon by Congress.
“Hence, as Chairperson of the Committee on Health and Co-Chair of the Joint Congressional Committee for UHC, I am taking the initiative to include under the ‘Bayanihan to Recover As One Act’ or Bayanihan 2, a provision that will grant the President of the Philippines the power to authorize the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines even without undergoing Phase IV clinical trial,” said Tan.
Tan’s move will speed up the procurement process for COVID 19 vaccines and was inspired by reports that several leading international pharmaceutical firms and drug laboratories have reported positive results of development of candidate vaccines.Leading the pack of vaccine developers is US-based Moderna MRNA which became the first company to start human clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday disclosed that the Moderna invention has resulted in “robust” immune response among participants of the human trial.
Other optimistic developments were reported by Pfizer PFE which is collaborating with BioNTech, a biotech firm based in Germany.
The US government has released $1.6 billion to finance the late-stage development of the coronavirus vaccine candidate of Novovax Inc.
Reports said the US government funding will also finance Novovax’s bid to put up a large-scale manufacturing line for its NVX-CoV2373 by the end of 2020. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, United States – US biotech firm Moderna said Tuesday it would enter the final stage of human trials for its COVID-19 vaccine on July 27, to test how well it protects people in the real world.
(AFP File Photo/Maddie Meyer/ MANILA BULLETIN)
The announcement came as the results from an earlier trial intended to prove the vaccine was safe and triggered antibody production were published.
The upcoming Phase 3 trial will recruit 30,000 participants in the US, with half to receive the vaccine at 100 microgram dose levels, and the other half will receive a placebo.Researchers will then track them over two years to determine whether
they are protected against infection by the virus. Or, if they do get infected, whether the vaccine prevents symptoms from developing.
If they do get symptoms, the vaccine can still be considered a success if it stops severe cases of COVID-19.
The study should run until October 27, 2022, but preliminary results should be available long before.
The announcement came after the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday published results from the first stage of Moderna’s vaccine trial, which showed the first 45 participants all developed antibodies to the virus.Moderna is considered to be in a leading position in the global race to
find a vaccine against the coronavirus, which has infected more than 13.2
million people and killed 570,000.
But scientists caution that the first vaccines to come to market may not be the most effective or safest.
Encouraging resultsModerna had previously published “interim results” from the first stages of its trial, called Phase 1 in May.
The early results were called “encouraging” by Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is co-developing the vaccine.
But some in the scientific community said they would reserve judgment until they saw the full results in peer-reviewed form.
According to the paper, 45 participants were split into three groups to test doses of 25 micrograms, 100 micrograms and 250 micrograms.
They were given a second dose of the same amount 28 days later.After the first round, antibody levels were found to be higher with higher doses.
Following the second round, participants had higher levels of antibodies than most patients who have had COVID-19 and gone on to generate
their own antibodies.
More than half the participants experienced mild or moderate side ef-
fects, which are considered normal.
The side effects included fatigue, chills, headache, body ache and pain
at the injection site.
Three participants did not receive their second dose.
They included one who developed a skin rash on both legs, and two who
missed their window because they had COVID-19 symptoms, but their tests
later returned negative.
Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University, said it was encouraging that the participants developed high levels
of an advanced class of antibodies.
He added, however: “You have to be very limited in how much you can extrapolate from a phase one clinical trial, because you want to see how this works when a person is exposed to the actual virus.”
The Moderna vaccine belongs to a new class of vaccine that uses genetic material – in the form of RNA – to encode the information needed to grow the virus’s spike protein inside the human body, in order to trigger an immune response.
The spike protein is a part of the virus that it uses to invade human cells, but by itself the protein is relatively harmless.
The advantage of this technology is that it bypasses the need to manufacture viral proteins in the lab, helping to ramp up mass production.
No vaccines based on this platform have previously received regulatory approval.
Early work using this technology backfired by making hosts more, not less, susceptible to infection, David Lo, a professor of biomedical sciences at University of California Riverside told AFP.
“One of the things we certainly want to look out for is whether there is a long term effect where the immune response… potentially develops an immunologic tolerance which would actually be detrimental to protection,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

EDUARDO GONZALES
I do not doubt that we will eventually develop a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19. The signs point to that—the virus does not mutate at a fast rate, some of the promising vaccines are already undergoing clinical trials, governments are cutting the red tape that is associated with vaccine approval, and manufacturing deals are already being signed.But let’s temper our expectations because, despite all this good news, a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine is unlikely to be available for mass immunization anytime soon. Furthermore, contrary to what most people think, a vaccine will not eradicate the virus overnight, if it eradicates the virus at all.It takes time to produce a new vaccine
It takes years to produce a safe and effective vaccine. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years. Experts are not starting from scratch when it comes to the Covid-19 vaccine. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a relative of the SARS and MERS viruses, and a lot of work has already been done on the development of a vaccine for these two infections that can be put into good use in the development of a Covid-19 vaccine. Still, the most optimistic estimates place a Covid-19 vaccine as one to two years away.
Vaccine development is a complex and painstaking multi-stage process. It starts with identifying the antigens (parts or weakened strains of a virus) that will be incorporated in the candidate vaccine. Then, tissue-culture or cell-culture and animal testing are performed to find out if the candidate vaccine will produce immunity.
This is followed by three stages of clinical testing. Phase one entails testing for safety and immunogenicity in normal adults (less than 100 people), phase two entails testing for immunogenicity and safety in special populations (hundreds of human subjects), while phase three, which can include thousands of test subjects, continues to measure the safety (rare side effects sometimes don’t appear in smaller groups) and effectiveness of the candidate vaccine.After the clinical trials, the candidate vaccine is submitted for regulatory review and approval. It is only after it is approved by regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA), is a vaccine manufactured. A vaccine will not eradicate the virus overnight
No vaccine is 100 percent effective. The flu vaccine is only 65 percent effective while the measles vaccine is 95 percent effective. Even if the Covid-19 vaccine turns out to be as highly effective as the flu vaccine, as many as five percent of people who get the vaccine can still get sick with Covid-19. But a vaccine need not be 100 percent effective to achieve herd immunity. Herd immunity refers to the protection from a contagious disease that is conferred on an entire population because enough of its people are immune to (i.e., they do not get or spread) the disease. The percentage of the population which must be immunized to achieve herd immunity varies for each disease. For highly contagious diseases, the required figure is high. Measles requires 90 to 95 percent immunization coverage to achieve herd immunity, polio is 80 to 85 percent, while for Covid-19, that remains to be determined.The measles vaccine has been around since the late ’60s and despite an effective vaccine and all-out immunization campaigns, as a country, we have not attained herd immunity from measles. Periodic outbreaks of the disease still occur, killing hundreds of Filipino children annually.
To date, the only pathogenic virus we have eradicated worldwide is the smallpox virus. In 1958, armed with a safe and effective vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) started a global immunization campaign against smallpox. Yet it was only in 1979, more than 20 years later, that the WHO declared the world as free from smallpox.
All indications, therefore, point to the fact that, even in the best-case scenario, the virus will stay with us for a long, long time. But the situation is not hopeless, because we can adopt certain lifestyle changes that can contain the spread of the virus and prevent it from infecting us. And I’m pretty certain that an antiviral drug that can alleviate if not cure Covid-19 will become available soon. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Separately, the US also said it was providing $450 million to Regeneron for its experimental COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis, a combination of two antibodies.
Under the terms of its agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Defense, Novavax agrees to deliver 100 million doses of its vaccine, potentially by the end of the year.“We are honored to partner with Operation Warp Speed to move our vaccine candidate forward with extraordinary urgency in the quest to provide vital protection to our nation’s population,” said Stanley Erck, the company’s president and CEO.
The final stage Phase 3 trial of its vaccine, called NVX-CoV2373, is set to take place this fall.
The Maryland-based company uses insect cells to grow synthesized pieces of the SARS-CoV-2’s “spike protein,” which the virus uses to invade cells, in order to trigger the human body’s immune response.
It also uses an “adjuvant,” a compound that boosts the production of neutralizing antibodies.In the spring, the company said it had proven the efficacy of a seasonal flu vaccine it had developed using similar technology.
The amount awarded to Novavax by the US is higher than the $1.2 billion given to the Oxford University vaccine that is being developed by AstraZeneca.
Under Operation Warp Speed, the US is aiming to deliver millions of doses of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 in 2021.Also Tuesday, the US said it was providing New York-state based Regeneron with $450 million to scale up manufacture of its COVID0-19 antibody treatment.
The company, which announced on Monday it was entering late stage human trials, estimates that it could have between 70,000 and 300,000 treatment doses, with the first available by late summer.
The drug, called REGN-COV2, is a combination of two antibodies that block the coronavirus’ spike protein.
Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of antibodies harvested from genetically-modified mice with human immune systems and from humans, identifying the two they found to be most potent, while not competing against each other.
The company uses a multi-antibody strategy to decrease the chances that the virus will mutate in order to evade the blocking action of a single antibody, an approach it detailed in a recent study in Science.Last year, a triple antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron was shown to be effective against the Ebola virus.

Malacañang said the government is more than willing to sell its assets to buy COVID-19 vaccines that will be developed by any country, even if it is not China.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque (RESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the statement after it was reported that an experimental COVID-19 vaccine being developed by American drug giant Pfizer and biotech firm BioNTech from Germany showed positive results.
In Friday’s episode of “Laging Handa” public briefing aired over state-run PTV-4, Roque said it does not matter anymore if other countries will first come up with a vaccine before China.“Basta po meron nang gamot diyan sa COVID-19, basta may bakuna, ibebenta natin lahat ng ari-arian ng ating gobyerno para makabili po tayo para sa ating mga kababayan. (As long as there is a cure or vaccine for COVID-19, we will sell all our assets so we can buy them for our citizens),” he said.
“‘Yan po ang paninindigan ni Presidente. Buhay muna bago ari-arian (That is the stand of the President. Lives over properties),” he added.
BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said its BNT162b1 produces antibody responses at or above the levels seen in any convalescent serum at relatively low doses.
An AFP report said the preliminary data come from a so-called phase 1/2 trial that aimed to show the vaccine is not toxic and triggers an immune system response to prepare the body to fight off the virus.The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says a total of 23 COVID-19 vaccine projects have launched clinical trials on humans.
Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping assured President Duterte that the Philippines would be prioritized once China is able to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, a disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus that originated from Wuhan, China.
President Duterte has stressed the need to cooperate with research trials aimed at developing a vaccine. Roque also earlier said that the Philippines is expected to participate in clinical trials by the last quarter of the year. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The country cannot truly claim victory against the coronavirus until the world finds a safe and effective vaccine or cure to the deadly disease.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque made the admission after clarifying his remarks that the country was “winning” the battle against the pandemic.Roque had earlier congratulated the nation for beating a University of the Philippines (UP) forecast on 40,000 cases of coronavirus cases last month, triggering a firestorm of criticisms from some lawmakers and groups for allegedly being misinformed. The country had 37,514 cases of infections at the end of June.
“Kapag sinabi nating nananalo po tayo, dahil nahanda po natin ang ating health system para magbigay lunas sa mga magkakasakit bagamat tama po kayo, hindi talaga tayo mananalo habang walang bakuna, habang walang gamot dito sa sakit na ito (When we say we are winning, it is because we have prepared our health system to provide treatment for the sick. But you are right, we really cannot win until there is no vaccine, medicine to this disease),” Roque said during a Palace press briefing on Thursday.
Roque explained that he was merely celebrating the “small victory” of the country in having cases lower than the UP forecast.
Roque was reacting to Senator Nancy Binay’s pronouncement that it was premature to declare the country was winning the fight against the pandemic. Binay said there should be a “semblance of normalcy” if the country was indeed winning the fight. Metro Manila’s continued general community quarantine (GCQ) status belies Roque’s comment, she added.
The country is largely under modified general community quarantine as the government moved to revive the economy and promote livelihood of the people.
Cebu City remained under enhanced community quarantine due to the surge in infections, while Metro Manila kept its GCQ classification until mid-July. Other areas under GCQ are Benguet, Cavite, Rizal, Lapu-Lapu City, Mandaue City, Leyte, Ormoc, Southern Leyte, Talisay City, and the municipalities of Minglanilla and Consolacion in Cebu.
As of July 2, the country has recorded 38,805 cases of coronavirus with 10,673 recoveries and 1,274 deaths.Roque has trumpeted the gains in the fight against coronavirus, citing the decrease in the fatality rate and the plateauing case positivity rate.
“Ang patuloy na pagbababa ng mga namamatay sa virus ay matuturing nating small victory po. Ang tagumpay na ito, gaano man kaliit, ay tagumpay na masasabi (The continued drop in the deaths from the virus is considered a small victory. This victory, no matter how small, is still a victory),” he said.
Roque also claimed that case positivity rate has somehow “plateaued” after it reached 7.12 percent. “Sa buwan po ng June, ito po ay more or less stable. At ngayon po, ang positivity rate natin ay 7.12, ibig sabihin po niyan – 7 out of 100 persons actually tested positive for COVID-19 (For the month of June, it is more or less stable. Our positivity rate is now 7.12, meaning seven out of 100 persons actually tested positive for COVID-19),” he said.
He said the country could sustain the gains in containing the spread of the disease if the people will continue to cooperate and observe health measures. The wearing of face masks, frequent hand washing, and safe distancing from others could help stop the spread of infection, he added.
On government efforts to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, Roque said they will accelerate expanded testing efforts to detect, isolate, and treat patients with illness. The government will also resort to “localized or granular lockdowns” to curb the spread of the illness while limiting its impact on the economy. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

By Ben Rosario
The House of Representatives is adopting a very optimistic and refreshing view in the worldwide fight against the COVID 19 pandemic – it will set aside funds for the purchase of vaccines against the viral scourge.
House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano
(Alan Peter Cayetano / Facebook page/ MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
As early as now, Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano said funds should “already be allocated for the COVID-19 vaccine” even as he described as “very conservative” the government plan to submit a P4.3-trillion annual budget for 2021.Currently, pharmaceutical research laboratories in United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, and China, a number of them financed by the US government, are now racing to develop the first vaccine that would stop the spread of the killer virus. But so far, there remains no assurance that one will be developed anytime soon.
Still, Cayetano believes that funds should already be reserved to give Filipinos a bigger chance at getting vaccinated once an anti-COVID 19 vaccine is available.
“What if there is a vaccine and they won’t supply unless you pay at once? So the funds should already be available in the budget,” he said.
According to the House leader, a number of countries expect to develop a vaccine in about a year. He was apparently referring to various reports that the vaccine race has become very competitive worldwide.But if research laboratories fail to produce a vaccine, the House leader said the money allocated for the program could easily be used to finance COVID-19 testing or procure medical supplies.
“They (government) won’t have to go back to Congress for additional appropriation,” Cayetano stated.
Some eports indicated that Oxford University and pharmaceutical AstraZeneca have received huge funding from Great Britain and the US.French drugmaker Sanofi is also speeding up clinical trials of its vaccine candidate and is reportedly eyeing approval of regulatory authorities by the first six months of 2021.
Meanwhile, Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore has also joined the race and is experimenting on a vaccine candidate that uses genetic material to create an immune response in the body.
British press reported that Prince William had met patients participating in a human trial of what they claimed to be a promising COVID-19 vaccine.
With these developments, Cayetano said he and his House colleagues “want to enter 2021 fully aware that the country has to meet the challenges of COVID-19 head-on.”
Aside from the COVID-19 vaccine fund, the Lower House is also eyeing the allocation of funds for economic stimulus to help affected sectors recover from the harsh beatings they suffered during the pandemic.“We’re already talking about what part of the 2021 budget is stimulus as well,” he said.
Such appropriations would be in addition to those that would be contained in Bayanihan 2 or the proposed “We Recover as One” law, he added.
In an interview, Cayetano revealed that the House, together with the Senate and the Department of Finance, are now close to agreeing on the final version of the proposed legislation.
“I think 80-90 percent we’ve gone over it and we already have some consensus,” he said.
Bayanihan 2 would include loans for small and medium businesses, and funds for the procurement of more testing and medical supplies, and for tourism, he said.
Part of the money would also go to the requirements of the blended learning program of the Department of Education (DepEd) under the new normal, he added.
Cayetano stressed that while Bayanihan 1 or the We Heal as One Law was very general and broad in its language, the House wants Bayanihan 2 to be more detailed.
“For example, we don’t want to allocate funds for tourism in general. We want to be more specific. Is the money for facilities, infrastructure, or is it for training of tourist guides? But we are also discussing some flexibility for the executive branch,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

By Agence France-Presse
The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that a few hundred million COVID-19 vaccine doses could be produced by the end of the year – and be targeted at those most vulnerable to the virus.
The UN health agency said it was working on that assumption, with a view to two billion doses by the end of 2021, as pharmaceutical firms rush to find a vaccine.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said researchers were working on more than 200vaccine candidates around the world, including 10 that are in human testing.
“If we’re very lucky, there will be one or two successful candidates before the end of this year,” she told a virtual press conference.
She identified three groups most in need of the first wave of vaccine doses.
They are front-line workers with high exposure, such as medics and police officers; those most vulnerable to the disease, such as the elderly and diabetics; and people in high-transmission settings, such as urban slums and care homes.“You have to start with the most vulnerable and then progressively vaccinate more people,” Swaminathan said.
“We are working on the assumption that we may have a couple of hundred mil – lion doses at the end of this year, very optimistically,” she said.
“We’re hoping that in 2021 we will have two billion doses of one, two or three effective vaccines to be dis – tributed around the world. But there’s a big ‘if’ there, because we don’t yet have any vaccine that’s proven.“But because of all the investments going into this, let’s say we have two billion doses by the end of 2021 – we should be able to vaccinate at least these priority populations.”
Pharmaceutical compa – ny executives said late last month that one or several COVID-19 vaccines could be – gin rolling out before 2021, but warned that an estimated total of 15 billion doses would be needed to suppress the virus.
Swaminathan said scien – tists were analyzing 40,000 sequences of the new coro – navirus and while all viruses mutate, this one was doing so far less than influenza, and had not yet mutated in the key areas that would alter the severity of disease or the immune response.
Lower immunity
People who catch COVID19 but don’t show symptoms may have significantly lower levels of immunity against the virus than those who become severely ill, new research showed Thursday.
The majority of virus pa – tients display relatively minor signs of infection, and a small proportion show no symptoms at all.
Very little is known about this group, given that they are far less likely to be tested than those who go on to develop severe symptoms including respiratory problems.
Researchers based in Chi – na compared two groups of individuals infected with COVID-19 in Chongqing’s Wanzhou district: 37 who showed symptoms versus 37 who did not.
The researchers analyzed blood samples from both groups taken a few weeks after recovering and found that just 62.2 percent of the asymptomatic group had short-term antibodies, com – pared with 78.4 percent of symptomatic patients.
After eight weeks of con – valescence, antibody pres – ence had fallen in 81.1 percent of asymptomatic patients, compared with 62.2 percent of symptomatic patients.
What’s more, asymp – tomatic patients were found to have lower levels of 18 pro- anti-inflammatory cellsignaling proteins than the symptomatic group, suggesting a weaker immune response to the novel coronavirus.
Authors of the study, which was published in Na – ture Medicine, said their findings called into question the idea that everyone who has had coronavirus are im – mune to future infection.
“These data might indi – cate the risks of using COVID19 ‘immunity passports’ and support the prolongation of public health interventions, including social distancing, hygiene, isolation of highrisk groups and widespread testing,” they wrote.
Danny Altmann, a spokes – man for British Society for Immunology as well as pro – fessor of Immunology at Imperial College London, said the research raised a vital question for combating COVID-19.
“Much immunology data so far has come from analyz – ing the sickest, hospitalized patients, but most people who have been more mildly affected will want to know whether this is likely to have conferred lasting, protective immunity,” he said.
Altmann said it was “an important and potentially worrying point” that many patients in the study showed a significant decline in antibody levels in just two months.
“Though this is quite a small sample size of patients, it is in line with some con – cerns that natural immunity to coronaviruses can be quite short-lived,” said Altmann, who was not involved in the research. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

This was the assurance made by US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper in a conference call with Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana last Friday, Independence Day (June 12).“Secretary Esper mentioned that developments on vaccines and therapeutics in the US are making very good progress, and expressed their willingness to share them with US allies and partners once available,” said Department of National Defense (DND) spokesperson Arsenio Andolong in a statement on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Lorenzana took the opportunity to share the Philippines’ response to COVID-19 pandemic as he thanked the US government for its medical assistance and donations.
The conference call between the top defense officials was bared after Malacanang announced that President Duterte had a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the eve of Independence Day.
According to Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, Xi told Duterte that the Philippines will get a “priority” access to a vaccine that it is also developing to combat COVID-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province.Other matters
Aside from COVID-19 response, Esper and Lorenzana also talked about the decision of Duterte to suspend the termination of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).
It was Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. who made the announcement on June 3, citing the need for a stronger collaboration among partner-countries to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increased tension in the South China Sea.Further, Esper and Lorenzana discussed about the security situation in the South China Sea which, in the past weeks, has been a witness to a seemingly flex of military might between US and China what with the deployment of their respective warships in the disputed waters.
The discussion between the US and Philippines Defense chiefs also covered counter-terrorism and logistics cooperation, and the capability upgrades of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).
“Both sides committed to sustain dialogues amidst the pandemic and strengthen the cooperation between the two defense establishments,” Andolong said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

China has pledged to make its potential coronavirus vaccine a “global public good” and prioritize the Philippines to access it, owing to the close relations with their “friendly neighbor.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to President Duterte his country’s closer cooperation to combat the pandemic, including access to vaccines and a steady supply of medical goods, in a phone conversation Thursday (June 11) evening.The phone call between the two leaders lasted 38 minutes and was “productive, open, and focused,” according to Malacañang. It transpired a few days after the two countries observed the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations on June 9.
“President Duterte stressed the need for cooperation in research trials for COVID-19 vaccine and treatments. While noting China’s vaccine development program, President Duterte emphasized the imperative of making vaccines accessible and affordable to all countries, including the Philippines,” a Palace statement read.
“For his part, President Xi reiterated China’s commitment to the international community to make any vaccine it develops a global public good and that as a friendly neighbor, China certainly considers the Philippines as a priority,” it added.
The two leaders also tackled both countries’ progress in fighting the pandemic and their strategies to restart their economies under the new normal. Xi has offered China’s full support to the Philippines in ensuring the supply chain especially of medical supplies and equipment, promoting the free flow of goods, and completing priority infrastructure cooperation projects in the country, according to the Palace.The Chinese leader also extended his gratitude for the country’s support for its own fight against COVID-19. He highlighted the Philippines’ goodwill donation to the city of Wuhan “describing this as acts of kindness that shall be returned many times more,” the Palace said.
Strategic cooperation
Both leaders have also agreed to further boost the comprehensive strategic cooperation between the Philippines and China to new levels. They likewise renewed their commitment to promote regional peace, stability, and prosperity.“Both leaders expressed appreciation for each other’s very warm written messages on the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the establishment of Philippines-China diplomatic relations. The exchange of letters demonstrated shared commitment to strengthen comprehensive strategic cooperation and articulated the resolve to uphold peace, stability, prosperity, and principles of international law, including the rule of law,” the Palace said.
Xi likewise offered warm wishes to Duterte and the Filipino people on the observance of the 122nd anniversary of Philippine independence.
President Duterte recently sent a letter to Xi on the occasion of the milestone in diplomatic relations, saying he considers China a “close neighbor and valued friend.”
Duterte also recognized that the two nations must continue to strengthen the partnership especially in the face of the global health crisis. Xi, in his letter to Duterte, agreed to work closely with the Philippines on efforts to overcome the pandemic.
In recent months, China has donated medical equipment and supplies to the Philippines to boost its coronavirus response. Some Chinese biopharmaceutical firms have also recently been tapped by the Philippine government for the research and development of a potential coronavirus vaccine.As of June 11, the number of the country’s cases of coronavirus has soared to 24,175 with 1,036 deaths.
Years-long conflict
The two countries have been locked in a territorial conflict in the West Philippine Sea for years, with China aggressively reclaiming areas in the disputed waterway.
Under Duterte’s leadership, the Philippines opted to pursue dialogue with China to manage the territorial dispute while pursuing close economic and security ties with Asian giant. Duterte often declared that the country cannot afford to go to war with China over the territory since it will lead to the massacre of government troops.
In July 2016, the Hague-based arbitration court ruled that China has no legal or historical basis to claim rights over resource-rich South China Sea. The United Nations-recognized tribunal said China breached the sovereign rights of the Philippines by building artificial islands, interfering with its fishing and oil projects. Beijing has refused to recognize the decision. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A Chinese biopharmaceutical company will be among the “potential collaborators” in the country’s research and development for a coronavirus vaccine.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque
(OPS / MANILA BULLETIN)
According to Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) has approved the inclusion of Sinovac Biotech Ltd. to the list of organizations that will collaborate with the government in the COVID-19 vaccine development and clinical trials.The involvement of Sinovac, contained in IATF Resolution No. 44, was made upon the recommendation of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).
Last month, the inter-agency task force approved the DOST’s recommendations on the country’s participation in the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines.
The department earlier proposed the country’s collaboration with four institutions — Adimmune Corporation, Academia Sinica, Chinese Academy of Science-Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, and SinoPharm–Wuhan Institute of Biological Products — and the Beijing Institute of Technology in the development of a potential coronavirus vaccine.
President Duterte earlier expressed his optimism about the country’s involvement in the clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine in the last quarter of 2020 in the hope it will save more lives.“The President wants to save the life of each and every Filipino and thus places great interest in these clinical trials,” Roque said late last month.
Roque said the DOST has been tasked to provide the country’s collaborating organizations with the Department of Health, World Health Organization, and Food and Drug Administration Philippines guidelines on vaccine clinical trials.
The department must also identify the sites, the local institutions, and the Filipino researchers who will be involved in the collaborative trials; assist local participating institutions in their proposals and budgets, obtain ethics board approvals, as well as formalize the agreements.

In his public address on state television Friday, the President said Moderna has entered the final stage of testing to determine the efficacy of its potential vaccine. He noted that vaccine supply will be limited unless the US company shares the technology and “gives it free to everybody.”“The earliest that mayroon na sila, they are in the final stage of testing, ang Moderna. It’s Moderna, it’s a US — pero it’s backed up by several… Mukhang mauna ito sila and they say mid-summer available na (The earliest that they can have, they are in the final stage of testing. It’s Moderna. It’s a US firm but it’s backed up by several.. they will be first in the line and they say it’s available by mid-summer),” he said.
“But they can only produce 200 million and that is only good for — America has something like three — 3.4 — 314 million sila. Kulang pa ‘yung…Well, kung ibigay nila… If they will share the — ‘yung technology, give it the — for free to everybody (But they can only produce 200 million and its only good for.. America has something like 314 million population. It won’t be enough unless well, if they share the technology, give it for free for everybody),” he said.
Moderna recently announced that it was preparing for the third phase of its trials on the coronavirus vaccine candidate dubbed mRNA-1273 by next month. The company was reportedly the first to start human testing with its potential vaccine.
The President, meantime, appealed anew to the public observe the health precautions such as wearing of face mask, frequent hand washing, and safe distancing from others. The country is currently placed under community quarantine at varying levels to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease.“Remember when you go out, (wear a face) mask,” the President told the nation.
Duterte also suggested using alcohol to sanitize hands as he a made a demonstration during his public address.
“Ito mura naman ito eh. Hindi naman ito ano, because siguro mag-ano kayo. Isang — eh tingnan mo,” he said while squeezing alcohol from a small bottle. “One, two, three, four. That is enough to kill the germs,” he said, rubbing alcohol on his hands. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Sanofi Pasteur Philippines Country Manager Dr. Jean Antoine Zinsou said that they are not yet at the stage of having clinical trials “involving volunteers.”“We are at the early stage of the development of our vaccine and it is not only later on that we’re gonna have some study involving individuals to test the immunogenicity of this candidate vaccine, and also to assess the safety and efficacy of this vaccine. But we won’t get there before next year,” Zinsou told reporters on Friday.
“Based on our projections, we can be confident enough in saying that within 18 to 24 months we should have a vaccine ready for registration,” he added.
Zinsou said that it is important not to “raise too much hope” on the vaccine’s development as there are “a lot of uncertainties along the way.”
“It’s our responsibility not to raise too much hope. We need to be honest with the timelines. We need to acknowledge the fact that there are uncertainties, but at the same time, we are developing this vaccine but we are also developing manufacturing capacity –and that is our part of the work,” he said.“We are dealing with biologicals. It means we are dealing with living materials which are viruses. Yes, we can project some timelines but there is no guarantee because we don’t know how the virus will react. When you develop a vaccine, there is always a risk of failure,” he added.
Zinsou said that they are already in partnership with their rival, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), for the vaccine development for COVID-19.
If they succeed in developing the vaccine, Zinsou said that they are eyeing to produce 600 million to one billion doses per year in order to “match the international requirement and there is no reason on our side to leave any country who will need it aside.”“The world is open to this numerous number of candidate vaccines because we know out of this hundreds of vaccines that are [being] developed, only a few will reach the safety and efficacy requirement to be put on the market,” he said.
While the vaccine is being developed, Zinsou suggested that countries should start identifying how the vaccine will be administered to a specific population that is considered “more at risk.”
“Each country needs to have a clear picture of epidemiological situations to define which population is more at risk and which population should be prioritized when the vaccine is available. Because we know, we won’t be able to vaccinate everybody at the same time. So, we will have to define who needs to be prioritized,” he said.
“It is up to the country to define these parameters and to get prepared to implement a vaccination program,” added Zinsou. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

China may become the first country to discover a vaccine for the new coronavirus disease, President Duterte disclosed Thursday night (May 28).

In his televised public address, the President said China has started to develop a potential coronavirus vaccine and may be able to distribute the drug by September.“Everybody has a God. Just pray that the vaccine — ang target nila (their target) is November — ah, September. September, I think China will be able to distribute, if I’m not mistaken. And the other countries are catching up. Everybody is at it so they are really trying their very best,” he said.
“Kaya lang itong China hindi ito hambog. Wala itong ere. (China is not arrogant. It is not boastful.) Tut they, you know, they work and I’m very sure that they will be the first one — one of the countries that would be able to come up with a vaccine,” he added.
The President earlier said he was looking for funds to purchase the coronavirus vaccine once it is made available. He said many countries were on the verge of discovering a vaccine for the illness that has infected millions of people across the world.
But until the vaccine is discovered, the President appealed anew to the public to observe the health precautions, including mask-wearing and physical distancing. He told the public to remain vigilant as the community quarantine remains in effect in the country to cub the spread of the coronavirus.“Remember the COVID microbes are still in the air that you breathe, that you pass on to your fellowmen if you are not ready or willing to wear the mask. It is precisely — this is the protection, not for you if you do not want it, but for the protection of the other guy,” he said.
Duterte earlier approved the recommendation to place Metro Manila and several areas under the more relaxed general community quarantine (GCQ) by June 1. Other places in the country, he added, will shift to the modified GCQ next month.
The President meantime defended the government’s authority to impose restrictions on the movement of people while the quarantine is in effect. He said the state has “every right to control your movement if you pass on a contagion to the population.”“For you to pass the virus, if you get it from one place and from another person and pass it to the other guy, that’s different. That is where the right of the state comes in so that to prevent a mass contagion,” he said.
“That is the reason of the essence of the police power of the state, to come up with measures to protect public interest, public health, public safety,” he added.
As the country battles the pandemic, Duterte also said the government must also keep peace and order to prevent anarchy in the streets. He said citizens must obey laws or else face consequences for breaking them.
“People trying to seize other people’s property or things like just being into a state of anarchy, the state has the right to come in and kkrrkk — put a stop on it. That is the survival of the Republic of the Philippines,” he said.

With the “danger” posed by SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), President Duterte is not keen on allowing opening of classes that call for students to be physically present in schools like in pre-COVID days until a vaccine against the disease is discovered.
The President said it was useless to discuss any class resumption if the safety of the students from the disease cannot be guaranteed.
President Rodrigo Roa Duterte holds a meeting with members of the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Emerging Infectious Diseases
(IATF-EID) at the Malago Clubhouse in Malacañang on May 25, 2020. (ACE MORANDANTE/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO/FILE PHOTO/MANILA BULLETIN)“I will not allow the opening of classes na magdikit-dikit ang mga bata. Bahala na hindi makatapos for this generation. Wala na makatapos na doktor pati engineer (I will not allow the opening of classes where students will be close in contact with each other. So be it if for this generation, no one will become a doctor and engineer),” Duterte said in his televised public address late Monday night.
“Wala nang aral, laro na lang (No more studying. Only play). Unless I am sure that they are really safe, it is useless to be talking about the opening of classes. Para sa akin, bakuna muna. Pag nandiyan na bakuna, okay na (For me, there must a be vaccine first. Once there is a vaccine, then I will allow classes to open),” he said.
The President remained optimistic that a coronavirus vaccine can be made available before the end of the year. The Philippines is participating in the clinical trials for potential coronavirus vaccines.
“I think by the grace of God, we will have a vaccine before the end of the year. They are feverishly working on it,” he added.
Until a vaccine is developed, Duterte urged the public not to be “reckless” and instead follow the health precautions, such as wearing of face mask, frequent hand washing, andsafe distancing to avoid infection. Without a vaccine, Duterte said there will be “danger” and “disaster.”
Safe
But Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said it is still “safe” to open classes in August.
The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) earlier approved the Department of Education’s proposal to move the class opening for basic education to August 24, 2020.
The school year will end on April 30, 2021.
The IATF also approved the different learning delivery modes proposed by DepEd such as face-to-face, blended learning, distance learning, homeschooling, among others.
Duque made the assurance during the Senate Health Committee hearing after he was asked by Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, the committee chairman whether or not it would be advisable to resume classes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We will study this matter carefully, but for now, we think that it’s safe if we will be opening classes by August 24,” Duque, one of the chairpersons of the IATF told the Senate panel through video conference.
“All of our minimum health standards, however, have to be in place,” he added which include. use of alcohol and sanitizers, and regular disinfection of classrooms.
He said schools could also adopt thermal scanning in entrances and advised parents not to send their children to school if they are sick.
Duque said he also believes DepEd has “strong” programs to make sure that the minimum health standards will be met. Online learning alternatives can also be used to lessen volume in schools.
“I think the resumption of classes will be safe. We have many measures in place, Mr. Chairman,” Duque told Go. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) has been directed to lead the preparations for such clinical studies, including identifying the study sites and researchers to be involved in the vaccine trials as well as getting the approval of the ethics board.“President Rodrigo Roa Duterte has expressed optimism over news [of] clinical trials for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. We expect involvement in the vaccine clinical trials by the last quarter of 2020 with the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) taking a lead role,” he said in a statement.
“The President wants to save the life of each and every Filipino and thus places great interest [in] these clinical trials,” he added.
He said the DOST has been tasked to provide the country’s collaborating organizations with the guidelines on vaccine clinical trials of the Department of Health (DOH), World Health Organization (WHO), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The department must also identify the sites, the local institutions, and the Filipino researchers who will be involved in the collaborative trials; assist local participating institutions in their proposals and budgets; obtain ethics board approvals; as well as formalize the agreements, according to Roque.The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) recently approved the DOST’s recommendations on the country’s participation in the clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines.
The DOST has proposed the country’s collaboration with four institutions, namely Adimmune Corporation, Academia Sinica, Chinese Academy of Science – Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, and SinoPharma–Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Beijing Institute, in the development of a potential coronavirus vaccine.
The task force has created a sub-technical working group chaired by DOST to coordinate with the DOH, Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, and the WHO for matters relating to the clinical trials.Proposed research centers under review
Roque also said the President will review the DOST’s recommendations to establish the Pharmaceutical Development Center and the Virology Science and Technology Institute of the Philippines. The DOST proposal was earlier approved by IATF during a meeting last Friday.
“If and once approved by PRRD, both can start in 2020, with the Pharmaceutical Group and the Virology Research Group evolving out of DOST’s Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI),” Roque said.
He said the DOST has included the establishment of these research centers in its 2021 budget proposal. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) has approved the country’s participation in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines.
Under Resolution No. 39 released on Saturday (May 23), the IATF approved the Department of Science and Technology’s (DOST) recommendations on the participation of the Philippines in the clinical trials.The country will be collaborating with Adimmune Corporation, Academia Sinica, Chinese Academy of Science – Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, and SinoPharma – Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Beijing Institute.
The resolution signed on May 22 states a sub-technical working group chaired by the DOST will be formed and directed to coordinate with the Department of Health (DOH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM), and the World Health Organization (WHO).
The resolution also states that collaborating organizations will be provided with the WHO requirements for COVID-19 vaccine target product profiles, pre-qualification process for WHO approvals, and the FDA’s updated guidelines on clinical trials.
“Pursuant to the foregoing, the FDA is directed to advise on the process to facilitate the issuance of permit for the conduct of the clinical trial in the Philippines,” the resolution states.It also requires that the study sites will be identified together with the researchers who will be involved in the clinical trials.
Once the clinical trials are finished, these will form part of the requirements for the vaccine registration process by the FDA for issuance of the Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) for market release in the Philippines.
The resolution also mentioned the IATF’s support for the DOST’s plans to establish a virology science and technology institute in New Clark City, and the reactivation of the pharmaceutical development unit at DOST-ITDI (Industrial Technology Development Institute) as a Tuklas Lunas Center for pharmaceuticals development.According to the resolution, the research centers can initiate and strengthen local vaccine development towards the country’s vaccine self-reliance and self-sufficiency.

“Tuloy lang ako, maski yung ibang fencers, sa pag-ensayo everyday. Kailangan kundisyon pa din maski na ganito yung sitwasyon,” said the 27-year-old Nicanor in a phone interview Friday with TheManila Bulletin.“Medyo mahirap mag-ensayo kasi puro strengthening yung nagagawa ko, unlike kapag nasa gym nakaka-galaw and nakaka-ensayo ng fencing moves. Sa bahay hindi rin magawa,” she added.
Nicanor and five other Filipino fencers were supposed to join the Asian Fencing Championship in South Korea last April, which is an Olympic qualifying tournament, but because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the competition has been rescheduled next year.
Last month, the International Olympic Committee announced that the 2020 Olympics has been reset to next year with a target date of July 23.
Nicanor accepts that only a vaccine against the virus is the best solution for things to return to normalcy, including sports events. Without that, she said, it would be very difficult to hold games.“Lahat naman tayo yun ang dasal, na sana matapos na, na sana magkaron ng vaccine… sa tingin ko yun ang makaka-stop sa pagkalat ng virus. We’re all hoping and praying,” she said.

Nicanor, who began fencing at age 15 with juniors coach Christian Canlas, rose to fame when she gave the country its first gold medal in fencing in the 2019 SEA Games here following her triumph in the women’s saber event.
The national team also won gold medal in the women’s epee.Also part of the national team under Elite coach Amat Canlas for next year’s Asian Championship are Chris Jester Concepcion in men’s saber, Hanniel Abella and Noelito Jose in women’s and men’s epee, Nathaniel Perez and Samantha Catantan in men’s and women’s foil events.
Concepcion and Abella earned silver medals in their respective events in the biennial meet, while Jose settled for the bronze.
The 18-year-old Catantan is the reigning Asian under-23 champion.
Nicanor said that if the Tokyo Olympics is canceled entirely because of the lack of a vaccine, she would still continue to aim for an appearance in the Summer Games.
“Para sa akin goal ko na yun… una nakuha ko na yung gold sa SEA Games. Hopefully kasunod na yung maka-qualify sa Asian Games and Olympics,” she said. “Kung hindi matuloy, susubok pa din ako sa next.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

People all over the world are hoping to restart social and economic life safely, including visiting family and friends and getting back to work.
A vaccine against COVID-19 is crucial to end the pandemic and to save lives and livelihoods. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is playing an important role in funding and speed¬ing up the development of COVID-19 vaccine candidates on a global basis.That is why Nestlé is supporting CEPI’s efforts with a donation of CHF 1 million (US$ 1.03 million). CEPI is working quickly and collaboratively with the ambition to develop a safe, effective and globally accessible COVID-19 vaccine within a 12-18- month timeframe.
They have already raised over $1 billion from governments, private donors and individuals around the world but need further funding to reach their goal of USD 2 billon to allow their COVID-19 programs to continue at pace.
Mark Schneider, CEO of Nestlé, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has created a lot of pain and hardship in communities around the world. A safe and effective vaccine will be needed to return to normality. That is why it was important to us to get on board when CEPI issued their call. We hope others will join us and support this important mission.”
CEPI is an innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organizations launched in Davos in 2017 to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The President said Moderna pharmaceutical firm has developed the vaccine that may become available by January 2021, adding that people should avoid dying until then.“I’m looking for money to — balikan ko ulit dito kasi nag-usapan — nag-usapan tayo ng pera na may pera ako pangbili ng (I’d like to go back since we’re talking about money, I need money to buy) vaccine just in case somebody else would beat the Moderna to the vaccine. I think China has already won. We are just waiting for the announcement,” Duterte said during his televised public address Tuesday.
“Kailangan may pera ako niyan kasi bili kaagad tayo (I need the money by then so we can immediately buy),” he added.
He admitted that the government has limited resources since it is “short of tax collection” amid the coronavirus lockdown.
The President welcomed the latest milestone in the global race for the coronavirus vaccine, citing that clinical trial of Moderna’s drug yielded “positive results.” He admitted that this was the “good news” he has been hoping for.“Mayroon ng vaccine but ang problema it will be ready, according to them, by 2021 pa. January at the very — at the earliest. So kung ganoon ‘wag ka sanang mamatay hanggang January, hintayin mo ‘yung vaccine (There is a vaccine ut the problem is it will be ready, according to them, by 2021. January at the very earliest. So just don’t die until January. Wait for the vaccine),” he said.
“‘Pag tinawag ka ng kamatayan sabihin mo, p***** i** ka umalis ka diyan kay may hinihintay ako na vaccine. Hindi ko pa panahon mamatay’ (If death calls you, tell him ‘Son of a b*tch, go away because I’m waiting for a vaccine. It’s not yet time for me to die’),” he said.
Duterte also cited that many countries are “on the ‘verge” of developing the drugs or vaccines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus disease. “Judging from the COVID started up to now, I’m sure they made a lot of progress in finding the vaccine,” he said.
 “Basta may vaccine, puwede na tayo makahiram (When a vaccine is found, we can borrow),” the President said.
While waiting for the coronavirus vaccine, the President has appealed anew to the public to follow the government’s quarantine regulations to contain the spread of the disease. He reminded people to wear face masks whenever they leave their homes as well as use alcohol to sanitize their hands.
Duterte said the coronavirus will “remain with us” until a vaccine is found. “Ang kalaban ng COVID (the enemy of COVID) it’s the vaccine that can really fight the infection,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

US biotech firm Moderna reported promising early results on Monday from the first clinical tests of an experimental vaccine against the novel coronavirus performed on a small number of volunteers.
US biotech firm Moderna reported promising early results from a clinical test of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine
The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said the vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, appeared to produce an immune response in eight people who received it similar to that seen in people convalescing from the virus.“These interim Phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection,” said Moderna’s chief medical officer Tal Zaks.
“These data substantiate our belief that mRNA-1273 has the potential to prevent COVID-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials,” Zaks said.
President Donald Trump welcomed the news saying “it’s incredible what they can do and I’ve seen results.
“And the results are staggeringly good,” Trump told reporters. “So I’m very happy and the market’s up very big.”Wall Street stocks posted substantial gains on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 3.85 percent and the S&P 500 up 3.15 percent.
Moderna shares gained 19.96 percent to close at $80.00 in New York.
Moderna, which was founded nine years ago, said the vaccine “was generally safe and well tolerated” and that patients suffered no more than redness or soreness from the shots.In a conference call, Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said the preliminary tests inspired confidence that mRNA-1273 has “a high probability to provide protection” against the virus.
“We could not be happier about these interim data,” Bancel said of the Phase 1 test, the first of three in the development of a vaccine.
Separate tests performed on mice showed that the vaccine prevented the virus from replicating in their lungs, according to the company.
The US government has invested nearly half a billion dollars in the development of Moderna’s vaccine candidate.
It is being developed in a partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease headed by Anthony Fauci and the clinical test was carried out by the National Institutes of Health.– ‘As fast as safely possible’ –
Three groups of 15 patients aged 18 to 55 received three different doses of the vaccine in the Phase 1 test, the complete results of which are not yet known.
The Phase 2 trial, with 600 subjects, has already received the green light from the US Food and Drug Administration and Moderna said they should begin this quarter.
A Phase 3 trial, the largest and most important to validate the efficacy of a vaccine, should begin in July.
“The Moderna team continues to focus on moving as fast as safely possible to start our pivotal Phase 3 study in July,” said Bancel, Moderna’s CEO.
Based on the Phase 1 partial results, Moderna said they would no longer study the highest dose since the lower doses appeared to provide some effect.
“The lower the dose, the more people we expect to be able to protect,” said Moderna president Stephen Hoge.
Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that while it was difficult to be sure of the results “from a press release,” there was reason for optimism.
“It must be noted that this is a Phase 1 study which has an object of showing the vaccine is able to induce an antibody response and that the dose range is appropriate,” Evans said.
“It will not be until the Phase 3 trial is completed that it will be known whether the vaccine actually prevents COVID-19 disease,” he added.
Trump has said he wants 300 million vaccine doses by January 2021 to protect the US population and his administration has provided funding to Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and France’s Sanofi.
The development of a vaccine usually takes years but the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused more than 315,000 deaths, has given unprecedented urgency to the search.
A dozen clinical trials are taking place around the world, half of them in China, according to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
China has said that it is carrying out tests on humans of five experimental vaccines.
The challenge is not only finding a safe and efficient vaccine but also producing billions of doses.
Several large laboratories, including Moderna, have said they would immediately begin production of an eventual vaccine even before the completion of all of the clinical trials.
Moderna recently announced a partnership with the giant drugmaker Lonza to boost its manufacturing capacity to up to one billion doses a year. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

US President Donald Trump Friday said he hoped a COVID-19 vaccine would be available by the end of the year, and announced he was appointing a former pharmaceutical executive to spearhead the effort.
“We are looking to get it by the end of the year if we can, maybe before,” Trump said, as he delivered an update on the race for a vaccine.“We think we are going to have some very good results coming out very quickly,” he told reporters in the Rose Garden of the White House.
The timeline projected by Trump is more optimistic than what Europe foresees.
The European Medicines Agency said Thursday a vaccine could be ready in a year’s time under an “optimistic scenario.”
Trump announced he would appoint Moncef Slaoui, the former head of GSK Vaccines, and four star army general Gustave Perna, to lead “Operation Warp Speed.”“My administration is providing roughly $10 billion to support a medical research effort without parallel,” the president said, comparing the effort with the Manhattan Project during World War 2 that led to the development of nuclear weapons.
Trump added that when a vaccine was ready the military would be enlisted to distribute it — and evoked a spirit of global cooperation.
“We are working together with many different countries, and again we have no ego,” he said.“Whoever gets it, we think it is great, we are going to work with them and they’re going to work with us. If we get it, we’ll be working with them.”
Scientists have cautioned that it is possible that despite worldwide efforts, it is possible that an effective vaccine may never be found — or that some vaccines could backfire and make people more, not less, susceptible to infection.
Trump also sought to temper expectations.
“Again, it is not solely vaccine based,” he said.
“Other things have never had a vaccine and they go away. So I don’t want people to think this is all dependent on a vaccine, but a vaccine would be a tremendous thing.”
Scientists have never previously developed a successful vaccine for any kind of coronavirus that infects humans.
Efforts that were underway against the SARS coronavirus were halted early because that disease was contained after infecting about 8,000 people, and it was therefore not judged profitable to pursue.
Vaccines do exist for animal coronaviruses, for example a type of coronavirus that infects chickens — and this is used by farmers.
However, it also kills a certain percentage of chickens, and such an outcome would not be acceptable in humans. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A keenly-watched COVID-19 vaccine will be priced to allow as wide as possible access to it, if it proves successful, and will be made at huge scale to keep costs down and supply up, said the Oxford University professor co-leading its development.
Adrian Hill, director of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, which has teamed up with the drugmaker AstraZeneca to develop the vaccine, said ensuring wide distribution and low cost have been central to the project from the start.“This not going to be an expensive vaccine,” Hill told Reuters in an interview. “It’s going to be a single dose vaccine. It’s going to be made for global supply and it’s going to be made in many different locations. That was always our plan.”
The experimental vaccine, known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, is one of the front runners in the global race to provide protection against the new coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic.
Preliminary data from a small trial of the experimental vaccine in six monkeys found that some of the animals given a single shot developed antibodies against the virus within 14 days, and all developed protective antibodies within 28 days.
When the monkeys were exposed to the new coronavirus, the vaccine appeared to prevent damage to the lungs and kept the virus from making copies of itself there, although it was still actively replicating in the nose.Hill said the data from the animal tests were “encouraging of course” and reinforced his team’s high degree of confidence that ongoing human trials of the shot will also show positive results. The first signals on whether and how well it works could come as early as July or August.
Hill’s team began early-stage human trials of the vaccine in April, making it one of only a handful to have reached that milestone.
Hill said that as of this week, more than 1,000 people have been dosed in the trial – with around half getting the experimental vaccine and the other half serving as a control group.Asked about the progress of the human trials, Hill said he and his team “are not going to give a running commentary” but added: “You can conclude that if the trial is still running – as it certainly is – that would mean there have been no major upsets.”
Almost 4.5 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and more than 301,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
Health and disease experts say a vaccine that protects people from the new coronavirus could help end the pandemic, but finding one that works and manufacturing enough doses is a huge challenge.
The ChAdOx vaccine, a type known as a recombinant viral vector vaccine, uses a weakened version of the common-cold virus spiked with proteins from the novel coronavirus to generate a response from the body’s immune system.
Other vaccines in human trials include those by Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE and China’s CanSino Biologics Inc.Hill told Reuters the ChAdOx1 project has at least seven manufacturing sites around the world. Those include India’s Serum Institute as well as sites in Europe and China.
Hill has said that up to a million doses of the shot are already being manufactured and will be available by September, even before trials fully prove whether it works.
“The ambition is shared to get a low-priced, very, very extensively available vaccine as soon as possible,” Hill said. “And one of the reasons that we chose Astrazeneca was because they shared that ambition and they were convincing that they could provide supply and large scale.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A keenly-watched COVID-19 vaccine will be priced to allow as wide as possible access to it, if it proves successful, and will be made at huge scale to keep costs down and supply up, said the Oxford University professor co-leading its development.
Adrian Hill, director of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, which has teamed up with the drugmaker AstraZeneca to develop the vaccine, said ensuring wide distribution and low cost have been central to the project from the start.“This not going to be an expensive vaccine,” Hill told Reuters in an interview. “It’s going to be a single dose vaccine. It’s going to be made for global supply and it’s going to be made in many different locations. That was always our plan.”
The experimental vaccine, known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, is one of the front runners in the global race to provide protection against the new coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic.
Preliminary data from a small trial of the experimental vaccine in six monkeys found that some of the animals given a single shot developed antibodies against the virus within 14 days, and all developed protective antibodies within 28 days.
When the monkeys were exposed to the new coronavirus, the vaccine appeared to prevent damage to the lungs and kept the virus from making copies of itself there, although it was still actively replicating in the nose.Hill said the data from the animal tests were “encouraging of course” and reinforced his team’s high degree of confidence that ongoing human trials of the shot will also show positive results. The first signals on whether and how well it works could come as early as July or August.
Hill’s team began early-stage human trials of the vaccine in April, making it one of only a handful to have reached that milestone.
Hill said that as of this week, more than 1,000 people have been dosed in the trial – with around half getting the experimental vaccine and the other half serving as a control group.Asked about the progress of the human trials, Hill said he and his team “are not going to give a running commentary” but added: “You can conclude that if the trial is still running – as it certainly is – that would mean there have been no major upsets.”
Almost 4.5 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and more than 301,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

Norway will give $1 billion to support the distribution worldwide of any vaccine developed against COVID-19 as well as for vaccines against other diseases, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Monday.
Oslo made the pledge as part of a donor conference held on Monday by the European Union to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.23 billion) towards the testing, treatment and prevention of the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Non-EU member Norway is a co-chair of the event as a long-standing donor to global health initiatives.
“This is a global problem that needs common solutions between countries, not least with distribution, so that everyone gets access to the vaccine,” Solberg told Reuters in an interview ahead of the conference.
The $1 billion will go to GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, a global partnership of private and public organizations focusing on immunisation worldwide, as direct funding for the period 2021-2030. Norway has financed GAVI since its inception in 2000.
Solberg said she regretted the United States, a close ally of Norway, had stopped funding the World Health Organization (WHO) and that it was not part of Monday’s initiative, which also includes Canada, Japan and Saudi Arabia, the current chair of the G20 group of nations.“It is a pity the U.S. is not a part of it. When you are in a crisis, you manage it and you do it jointly with others,” Solberg said.
“Everyone will certainly evaluate their work at some point and see what could have been done differently,” she said. “But you do this afterwards, not when you are in the middle of it.”
Oslo will also give an additional 50 million crowns ($4.8 million) to the WHO to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic, on top of its normal funding to the U.N. agency.Norway has already announced 2.2 billion crowns in funding to the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), set up to fight emerging epidemics by funding the development of new vaccines.
She said it was also in the interest of western nations to help developing nations with their coronavirus response to prevent longer-term problems.
“Without the medicine and the (possible) vaccine, there will be bigger economic setbacks, bigger security and environmental challenges, as well as migration challenges,” she said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año on May 3, Sunday, stressed that the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) has prevented the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) from claiming more lives.
Año attributed the surge of COVID-19 cases in the country despite the implementation of the ECQ to improved testing capacity, which is now estimated at 6,300 per day.
Department of Interior and Local Government
(DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año
(PCOO / MANILA BULLETIN)Earlier, the DILG chief said the ECQ may be relaxed when the country’s COVID-19 testing capacity reaches 30,000 per day.
Despite public grumblings, Año appealed for understanding imploring people that the ECQ has slowed down the spread of COVID-19.
Depending on how things proceed, he said, the President would then decide if the ECQ can be lifted or extended beyond May 15.
In the event it gets lifted, Año asserted the public should adjust to the policies under the so-called “new normal” to avoid a recurrence of the deadly virus.He believes that the decision to lift the ECQ and the general community quarantine (GCQ) in low-risk areas will be based on how the public adapts to this “new normal.”
Under this “new normal,” Año said the public should get used to regularly wearing face masks in public, observing physical distancing, and hygienic practices.
He noted that this should be observed until a COVID-19 vaccine is discovered.
In an interview with ANC, he cited the case of Singapore, where COVID-19 cases ballooned when its government thought that they already had the virus under control.
In late April, Singapore had a daily surge record of more than 1,400 COVID-19 cases, with most of the new infections linked to dormitories housing foreign laborers. Año noted that Singapore initially kept the viral pandemic in check with its strict testing and contact-tracing.
But as its government thought everything was under control, anti-COVID guidelines were relaxed, which resulted to a fast-moving second wave of cases.
The DILG chief noted that the country should be wary of being complacent as things may worsen if the “new normal” policies are not enforced. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

As the global cases of coronavirus topped over three million since the outbreak was confirmed in China late last year, dozens of laboratories around the world have been working on finding both a treatment and vaccine to stop the further spread of the disease.
As of April 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 102 candidate COVID-19 vaccines in development globally.Of the 102 potential vaccines, only eight are currently in clinical evaluation, while 94 are still in the pre-clinical trial stage.
Clinical trials, WHO explained, involve research on new tests and treatments and evaluates effects of these on humans.
China’s CanSino Biological Inc., in partnership with the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, has a candidate vaccine currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. The vaccine is based on the same platform as the Ebola virus disease.
United States drugmaker Pfizer, in partnership with Germany’s BioNtech and other pharmaceutical companies, are in Phases 1 and 2 trials.Also in Phases 1 and 2 is a vaccine developed by England’s University of Oxford. Scientists had already used the same platform directed against various infections, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza, tuberculosis, Chikungunya, Zika, and meningitis B.
Currently in phase 1 are potential vaccines developed by United States-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna, as well as vaccine candidates sponsored and developed by China’s Wuhan Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm, Beijing Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm, and Sinovac.
There are four phases of biomedical clinical trials, according to WHO.Phase 1 tests new drugs for the first time in a small group of people to evaluate a safe dosage range and identify side effects.
Phase 2 involves testing treatments that have been found to be safe in Phase 1 but need a larger group of human subjects to monitor for any adverse effects.
During Phase 3, tests are conducted on larger populations and in different regions and countries, and are often the step right before a new treatment is approved.
Lastly, during Phase 4, studies take place after a country approval has been secured, but there is a need for further testing in a wide population over a longer period.
Scientists have been saying that it may take about 12 to 18 months before a vaccine can be approved for mass use.Realizing the urgent need to stop the spread of infection in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has earlier promised to give P50 million, from an initial P10 million, to Filipino scientists who can develop a vaccine against the coronavirus disease.
The country has already recorded almost 9,000 cases of COVID-19 three months after the first case was reported in January 30.
Testing existing drugs
While it seems that it may take a little longer to find a vaccine, scientists are hoping to find a cure for COVID-19 soon.
Leading a team of Philippine experts taking part in the WHO’s solidarity trial is Dr. Marissa Alejandria of the University of the Philippines-College of Medicine and president of the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.
The solidarity trial is an international randomized and adoptive clinical trial to test the safety and effectiveness of four possible therapies in treating COVID-19, according to the Philippines’ Department of Health (DOH).
The DOH announced last April 22 the participation of the Philippines among more than 100 countries in the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of antiviral drug Ebola virus, Remdesivir; antimalarial drug, Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine; antiretroviral drugs used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), Lopinavir with Ritonavir; and multiple sclerosis treatment, Lopinavir with Ritonavir plus Interferon beta-1a.
“There is currently no magic drug or known treatment for COVID-19 and there is an urgency to find effective treatment,” DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said.
“The drugs included in this trial are largely untested against SARS-COV 2 virus that causes COVID-19, and more robust data is needed,” she added.
The testing will be conducted in at least 20 Level 3 hospitals nationwide.
In a report by CNN Philippines, hospitals that will be joining the “mega trial” are Philippine General Hospital (Manila), The Medical City (Pasig City), San Lazaro Hospital (Manila), Lung Center of the Philippines (Quezon City), Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (Muntinlupa City), Baguio General Hospital (Benguet), East Avenue Medical Center (Quezon City), Makati Medical Center (Makati City), St. Luke’s Medical Center Global City (Taguig), St. Luke’s Medical Center (Quezon City), University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center (Quezon City), Cardinal Santos Medical Center (San Juan), Manila Doctors Hospital (Manila), Manila Medical Center (Manila), Chinese General Hospital (Manila), San Juan de Dios Medical Center (Pasay City), Diliman Doctors Hospital (Quezon City), University of Santo Tomas Hospital (Manila), Vicente Sotto Medical Center (Cebu City), Southern Philippines Medical Center (Davao City), and World Citi Medical Center (Quezon City).
WHO said that based on emerging evidence, other drugs can be added.
However, until there is sufficient evidence, WHO cautions against physicians and medical associations recommending or administering these unproven patients with COVID-19 or people self-medicating with them. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Currently, there are six “vaccine candidates” that are being developed worldwide, WHO acting country representative for the Philippines Socorro Escalante said in a virtual presser with the Department of Health (DOH).
While these candidate vaccines are undergoing research and development, Escalante said the government can take advantage of the time to polish regulatory processes and formulate vaccine strategy.
“I think the country could take advantage of the vaccines that are now in the pipeline, but what is key for the country is to be able to prepare its regulatory processes… Because the vaccine development will really take time. For the meantime, we encourage the country to prepare its regulatory processes in terms of assessment and evaluation of the vaccine,” Escalante said.
This is to fast-track the process of receiving and registering the vaccines developed by other countries.
The WHO official also emphasized that the country should formulate strategies on the vaccine’s deployment “depending on how we are going to prioritize the vaccine to the more susceptible population.”
“Dahil kapag nagawa na ‘yung bakuna, hindi natin mababakunahan lahat ng tao at the same time, so ‘yung gobyerno kailangan ding gumawa ng (because when the vaccine is already available, we won’t be able to vaccinated everybody at the same time, so the government needs to formulate) vaccine strategy particularly by prioritizing more healthcare workers or ‘yung may comorbidities,” Escalante added.
The process to develop a vaccine to counter COVID-19 is “highly technical and tedious” as it may take a year to a year-and-a-half before it can be declared safe and effective.
“There are steps that scientists and experts must follow to be able to develop the vaccines,” Escalante said.
The first stage, which can last up to six months, is where the experts identify potential candidates for the vaccine. Clinical trials with three phases will then follow to test the vaccines on animals to determine their safety and efficacy.
“Then, the vaccine will be registered [with the] national regulation authority of a country for another evaluation. It will be given marketing authorization and could finally be used, but this period is actually the phase 4 of clinical trial where the vaccine needs to be monitored in terms of safety,” Escalante explained.
If the Philippines opts to develop a vaccine on its own in the future, the country must first prepare for local production capacity, particularly technology, the WHO official said.
“I think the Philippines has experts and scientists that are world-class, and we also have institutions to be able to undertake research and development, but the technology has to be really adapted to the vaccine development.
“The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine is capable but on a small scale. [A] laboratory for testing [the] quality and safety of the vaccine must also be developed,” Escalante said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa were among those who joined a video conference to launch what the WHO billed as a “landmark collaboration” to fight the pandemic.The aim is to speed development of safe and effective drugs, tests and vaccines to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, the lung disease caused be the novel coronavirus – and ensure equal access to treatments for rich and poor.
“We are facing a common threat which we can only defeat with a common approach,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he opened the virtual meeting.
“Experience has told us that even when tools are available they have not been equally available to all. We cannot allow that to happen.”
During the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, there was criticism that distribution of vaccines was not equitable as wealthier countries were able to purchase more.
“We must make sure that people who need them get them,” said Peter Sands, head of the Global Fund to Fight on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. “The lessons from AIDS must be learned. Too many millions died before anti-retroviral medicines were made widely accessible.”
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the objective at a global pledging effort on May 4 would be to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.10 billion) to ramp up work on prevention, diagnostics and treatment.
“This is a first step only, but more will be needed in the future,” von der Leyen told the conference.
“COMMON FIGHT”Leaders from Asia, the Middle East and the Americas also joined the videoconference, but several big countries did not participate, including China, India and Russia.
A spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva had earlier told Reuters that the United States would not be involved.
“Although the United States was not in attendance at the meeting in question, there should be no doubt about our continuing determination to lead on global health matters, including the current COVID crisis,” he said by email.
“We remain deeply concerned about the WHO’s effectiveness, given that its gross failures helped fuel the current pandemic,” he later said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has lambasted the WHO as being slow to react to the outbreak and being “China-centric” and announced a suspension of funding.
Tedros has steadfastly defended the WHO’s handling of the pandemic and repeatedly committed to conducting a post-pandemic evaluation, as the agency does with all crises.
Macron, Merkel, Ramaphosa, and Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were among those voicing strong support to WHO.
Macron urged all G7 and G20 countries to get behind the initiative, adding: “And I hope we’ll manage to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the U.S., because this is about saying ‘the fight against COVID-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle’.”
Merkel said: “This concerns a global public good, to produce this vaccine and to distribute it in all parts of the world.”
Ramaphosa, chairman of the African Union, warned that the continent – with its generally poor standards of healthcare – was “extremely vulnerable to the ravages of this virus and is in need of support”.
VACCINE TRIALS
More than 2.7 million people have been infected with COVID-19 and nearly 190,000 have died from it since the new coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, according to a Reuters tally.
“As new diagnostics, treatments and vaccines become available, we have a responsibility to get them out equitably with the understanding that all lives have equal value,” said Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation, which was WHO’s second largest donor last year.
More than 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, including six already in clinical trials, said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI vaccine alliance, a public-private partnership that leads immunization campaigns in poor countries.
“We need to ensure that there are enough vaccines for everyone, we are going to need global leadership to identify and prioritize vaccine candidates,” he told a Geneva news briefing.
Yuan Qiong, senior legal and policy advisor at Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Access Campaign welcomed the pledges but called for concrete steps. “There shouldn’t be any patent monopoly and profiteering out of this pandemic,” she told Reuters. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In his public address, President Duterte said he knew people had been wondering when could they return to their normal lives.“Ang interesado ninyong gustong lumabas sa bunganga ko. Kailan ba talaga ito matapos? Ang COVID ho hindi matatapos ‘yan (People are interested to know from me when this will end. COVID-19 will not go away). It will be here and it will stay until kingdom come,” he said.
The President said only a vaccine could end the COVID-19 pandemic.
“‘Pag may bakuna na — baka sakali nga mauna tayo — ma-emboldened ‘yung ating mga scientists (When there’s a vaccine already — perhaps we will be the first — maybe our scientists will be emboldened) to work overtime to come up with a vaccine,” he said.
“COVID equals vaccine, period,” he added.President Duterte then asked the public to bear with the quarantine restrictions because the government is trying to contain the spread of the disease.
“I can assure you that we are just waiting for the right time. Tiisin lang muna natin. Ako nakikiusap na sa inyo para lang ito sa bayan (Bear with it for now. I appeal to you because this is for the country). Because we are trying to limit the contamination,” he said.
“Alam ninyo ang ginagawa namin. Kung nagustuhan ninyo, magpasalamat kami. ‘Pag sabi ninyo kulang, then humihingi kami ng dispensa (You know what we are doing. If you like it, then thank you. If you feel we’re lacking, then we apologize). We’ll try our very best next time,” he added.President Duterte earlier said that he would lift the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) once a vaccine against COVID-19 is discovered. Malacañang has expressed confidence that the Philippines will be one of the first countries to benefit if China is able to develop a vaccine.
The President, meanwhile, offered P50 million to Filipinos who will be able to develop the necessary vaccine. He said he may even increase it to P100 million if he is satisfied.
President Duterte has extended the ECQ in Metro Manila and other “high-risk” areas in the country due to the threat of COVID-19. To date, the country has recorded 7,192 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 477 of whom have died while 762 recovered. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

“This is a landmark collaboration to accelerate the development,production and equitable distribution of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics for COVID-19,” World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing. “United we can fight this virus.”The event was co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and Melinda Gates of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
It included UN chief Antonio Guterres as a speaker, as well as global leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.
Conspicuously absent were leaders from China, where the novel coronavirus first surfaced late last year, and from the United States – the country currently hardest-hit by the pandemic, with nearly 50,000 dead and close to 900,000 infected.
US President Donald Trump earlier this month suspended funding to WHO, accusing it of kowtowing to China over the coronavirus outbreak.While no US representatives took part, a spokesman from the US mission in Geneva stressed in an email to AFP that “America’s world-leading scientists are working hard on a COVID-19 vaccine.”
“We welcome serious efforts to assist in that endeavour, and look forward to learning more about the World Health Organization’s proposal,” the spokesman said, stressing though that “we remain deeply concerned about the WHO’s effectiveness, given that its gross failures helped fuel the current pandemic.”
Worldwide, more than 190,000 people have died in the pandemic and more than 2.7 million have been infected, according to an AFP tally based on official sources.‘Threat to people everywhere’
“We face a global public enemy like no other,” Guterres told the briefing. “A world free of COVID-19 requires the most massive public health effort in history.”
He stressed the need to ensure that any diagnostic tests developed to detect the new virus, any drugs produced to treat it, and any vaccine made to prevent it should be provided to all of those in need.
“The world needs the development, production and equitable delivery of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics,” Guterres said.
“Not a vaccine or treatments for one country or one region or one-half of the world, but a vaccine and treatment that are affordable, safe, effective, easilyadministered and universally available, for everyone, everywhere,” he said.“None of us is safe until all of us are safe… COVID-19 anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.”
‘Only vaccine can stop COVID-19’
In the Philippines, President Duterte acknowledged that only a vaccine will stop COVID-19.
Duterte has asked the public to cooperate with the government in the fights against the COVID-19 pandemic because it will not go away unless there is a vaccine developed.
In his public address, President Duterte said he knew people have been wondering when can they return to their normal lives.
“Ang interesado ninyong gustong lumabas sa bunganga ko. Kailan ba talaga ito matapos? Ang COVID ho hindi matatapos ‘yan (People are interested to know from me when will this end. COVID-19 will not go away). It will be here and it will stay until kingdom come,” he said.
The President said only a vaccine can end the COVID-19 pandemic.
“’Pag may bakuna na – baka sakali nga mauna tayo – ma-emboldened ‘yung ating mga scientists (When there’s a vaccine already – perhaps we will be the first – maybe our scientists will be emboldened) to work overtime to come up with a vaccine,” he said.
“COVID equals vaccine, period,” he added.
Meanwhile, there were few concrete details divulged during the event on how the wide range of partners would roll out the initiative.
Von der Leyen, however, announced that the EU and its partners were preparing to organize a “worldwide pledging marathon” with an event on May 4 aimed at raising 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) for initial funding for developing diagnostics, treatments and vaccines against COVID-19.
“We need to develop as soon as possible a vaccine, produce it and deploy it to every single corner of the world,” she said, also stressing the need to “ramp up work on prevention, diagnostics and treatment.”
“The response to this pandemic can only be global.”
‘Leave no one behind’
Macron also called for making any vaccine developed “accessible everywhere, including in the most vulnerable countries,” insisting “that is what will allow us to return to normal life as quickly as possible.”
Ramaphosa, who serves as chair of the African Union, meanwhile stressed the precarious situation of that continent, which is home to many poor nations, with weak health systems.
“Africa is extremely vulnerable to the ravages of this virus and is in need of every possible support and assistance,” he said.
Seth Berkley, head of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, acknowledged that it was likely that “without a vaccine we will never defeat this pandemic.”
“What this means is that we will need to devise and deliver a vaccine program to get billions of doses out at a speed and scale never before contemplated, let alone achieved – the most rapid vaccine deployment in history,” he said.
Peter Sands, head of the Global Fund, meanwhile stressed that developing new tools against COVID-19 like vaccines “is essential but not enough. We must make sure that the people who need them get them.”
“The lessons from AIDS must be learned,” he said, pointing to the many millions who had died before anti-retroviral drugs were made widely accessible.
“We must leave no one behind.”
Virus alarm system
While global leaders make a push for coronavirus vaccines, Jing Wang spent the last few years developing a sensor that measures airborne germs. So when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, he figured he could tweak it to detect the new coronavirus.
The sensor could be useful in crowded areas like hospitals, train stations or classrooms, said Wang, a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology’s Institute of Environmental Engineering in Zurich. Still under development, the device is sensitive enough to tell the difference between the new pathogen and the related SARS virus that swept through the world in 2003.
A COVID alarm could prove helpful while researchers work to make a vaccine. The coronavirus has killed more than 184,000 people worldwide and led millions to shutter themselves at home to slow its spread.
“To fight the virus, or any epidemic, it’s very important to have early warnings,” Wang said. “The sensor gives you the chance to act immediately.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Concerned the new coronavirus may stay “until kingdom come,” President Duterte has offered a bigger reward for the highly anticipated discovery of a vaccine for the dreaded COVID-19 disease.

(IATF-EID) at the Malago Clubhouse in Malacañang on April 23, 2020.
(TOTO LOZANO/PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)Addressing the nation Friday morning, the President increased the incentive to P50 million from P10 million for any Filipino who will develop the coronavirus vaccine. Duterte said he might further raise the reward to P100 million if he becomes “happy.”
“‘Yung P10 million sa ating mga scientists dito sa Pilipinas, ‘yung mga doktor, the bright Filipinos working day and night trying to find out how to combat the COVID, I’m raising the bounty to P50 million. Fifty million ang bigay ko sa grupo dahil it is a collegial thing, hindi naman sa isang tao (On the P10 million offered to scientists in the Philippines, our doctors, bright Filipinos working day and nigh trying to find out how to combat the COVID, I’m raising the bounty to P50 million. I’ll give P50 million to a group because it is a collegial, not just one person),” Duterte said in a public address aired over state television.
“Baka ‘pag sa ligaya ko another P50 milion so that pag nandyan kapag maligaya ako masyado eh di 100. Puro kayo milyonaryo. Huwag kayong mahiya na tanggapin ‘yan (If I’m too happy, I might add another P50 million. It may reach 100. You’ll all be millionaires. Don’t be ashamed to take it),” said Duterte, who met with some Cabinet members on modifying the quarantine measures Thursday night.
Duterte, who has promised to lift the lockdown measures in Luzon if an effective coronavirus treatment is found, earlier offered a P10 million reward to any Filipino who can invent the coronavirus vaccine. A substantial grant has also been offered to the University of the Philippines and the Philippine General Hospital to enhance their the vaccine research and development.In the same remarks, the President has pledged to allocate more funding for the country’s research and development in the health sector.
He told Health Secretary Francisco Duque III to immediately tell him if the people involved in vaccine research will need more funds. He said he was willing to spend the country’s resources on fighting the coronavirus outbreak.
“Kung kailangan nila ng additional funding, all they have to do, I’m announcing it, is magsabi lang sa iyo and I will be glad to, kung di masyadong malaki, I said ipit tayo sa pera, I will readily give it to them (If they need additional funding, all they have to do, I’m announcing it, is to tell you and I will be glad to, if it’s not too big since we have limited money, I will readily give it to them),” he said.“I’d rather spend all of our money in connection with COVID, discovery, assistance,” he added.
Duterte also expressed confidence in the capacity of local scientists, saying he recognizes their dedication to find vaccines to promote public health. “What matters to me is the dedication and load of work they are performing,” he said.
He took pride that the Filipino scientists are at par with foreign counterparts, saying it was just a matter of time the coronavirus vaccine will be found. “Pabilisan lang ‘yan,” he said.
The President also renewed his promise to lift the enhanced community quarantine measures if the coronavirus vaccine is finally discovered. He recognized that the coronavirus pandemic will not end unless a vaccine is found.
“Ang COVID hindi matatapos (COVID will not end). It will be here, it will stay until kingdom come. Pero kung may bakuna na, baka sakali mauna tayo, ma-embolden ang ating mga scientists to work overtime to come up with vaccine (But if there is a vaccine, we might be the first as our scientists will be emboldened to work overtime to come up with the vaccine),” he said.“COVID equals vaccine period,” he added.
The new coronavirus disease has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide and killed more than 170,000 since it first broke out in China late last year. In the Philippines, the cases of infections have reached more than 7,000. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

By Analou De Vera
The Department of Health (DOH) has welcomed the P10 million reward offer of President Duterte to any Filipino who can discover a vaccine for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) but reminded the public that developing a vaccine is a tedious process.
Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire
(PNA)
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that vaccine development needs to undergo comprehensive research.“Mahalagang malaman ng lahat na hindi ito basta-bastang matutuklasan at gaya ng lahat ng gamot, dadaan ito sa masusing pananaliksik,” said Vergeire in a press brieifing. [It is important for everyone to know that this is not a mere discovery and that like all medicine, it goes through comprehensive research.]
Vergeire said that based on scientific evidence as of today, there is no proven cure for COVID-19 yet.
“Maraming small clinical trials sa iba’t-ibang bansa pero hindi ito lahat conclusive. Lahat ito ay experimental pa lang,” she said. [There are many small clinical trials in different countries but these are not at all conclusive. They are all experimental.]
Vergeire noted that 20 hospitals in the country have joined the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Solidarity Trial. This is a large-scale international clinical trial to investigate and identify effective drugs that can be used to treat COVID-19.The trial involves four treatment options: the investigational antiviral Remdesivir, antimalarial drug Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine, antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV Lopinavir with Ritonavir, and Lopinavir with Ritonavirplus Interferon beta-1a.
“We are optimistic that this megatrial, with over 90 participating countries, will promote the rapid generation of strong evidence for COVID-19, and ultimately stem this pandemic,” said Vergeire.
Plasma donationThe Philippine General Hospital (PGH) on Thursday reiterated its call for COVID-19 survivors to donate their blood to help other patients recover from the disease.
PGH spokesman Dr. Jonas Del Rosario said their donated blood will be used for plasma therapy that can potentially improve the health condition of COVID-19 patients.
“Their antibodies may help save patients who are still battling the disease, especially the severe and critical cases,” said Del Rosario.
“There is no proven treatment yet for this although different medications and regimens are being investigated. And the vaccine against the novel coronavirus is not yet available,” he added.
Del Rosario said the therapy involves the “transfusion of plasma, the liquid component of blood, from a recovered patient to a sick patient.”“Much like other organizations around the world, the PGH sees plasma therapy as a possible stop-gap to hold the virus at bay while more complex treatments are being developed,” he said.
“A vaccine is a year out but we can use the antibodies of those who have already survived to strengthen the immune system of those who are still battling the virus,” he added.

By Bloomberg, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse
The World Health Organization (WHO) said there are 83 coronavirus vaccines in development globally, with six candidates – half of them in China – already in human trials, as drugmakers race to find a cure for the deadly pathogen. That’s an improvement from April 13, when the WHO said there were 70 vaccines in development, with three candidates in human trials.

In Germany, the green light was also given for human trials of potential coronavirus vaccines developed by German biotech company BioNTech, which is racing teams in Germany, the US, and China to develop an agent that will stop the pandemic.The trial in Germany will be initially conducted on 200 healthy people, with more subjects, including some at higher risk from the disease, to be included in a second stage, German vaccines regulator the Paul Ehrlich Institut said on Wednesday.
BioNTech said it was developing four vaccine candidates under a programme named BNT162 with its partner, pharma giant Pfizer.
Tests of the vaccine were also planned in the United States, once regulatory approval for testing on humans had been secured there.
BioNTech, which awarded the rights in China to BNT162 to Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical under a March collaboration deal, is competing with Germany’s CureVac and US biotech firm Moderna in the race to develop messenger-RNA vaccines.These molecules act as recipes that instruct human cells to produce antigen proteins, which allow the immune system to develop an arsenal against future coronavirus infections.
Moderna started testing its experimental vaccine on humans in March.
Two different experimental coronavirus vaccines were approved for human tests by China last week. A unit of Sinovac Biotech and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products are developing these compounds.In March, China gave the greenlight for another clinical trial for a vaccine candidate developed by the Academy of Military Medical Sciences and biotech firm CanSino Bio .
US vaccine expert sacked
Meanwhile, the head of the US agency in charge of developing a vaccine against coronavirus said Wednesday that he was removed from his job for opposing the chloroquine treatment promoted by President Donald Trump.
Dr. Rick Bright said he was removed on Tuesday as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the government agency for developing and procuring treatments and vaccines, and moved to a lesser position in the National Institutes of Health.
“I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the COVID-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,” he said in a statement to US media.He said the move was a direct response to his resistance to “misguided directives” to support the use of malaria treatments chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus.
Those treatments, he said, were “promoted by the administration as a panacea,” but “clearly lack scientific merit”.
“While I am prepared to look at all options and to think ‘outside the box’ for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.”
Since mid-March Trump, backed by the conservative Fox News channel, has advocated for the use of chloroquine to treat COVID-19 infections, with scant evidence from studies of its safety or effectiveness.
Despite his own science advisors suggesting more study is needed, Trump repeatedly pushed for the drugs’ use, claiming the treatment could be a “gift from God” to counter the coronavirus pandemic.
On Tuesday the results of the largest study yet of hydroxychloroquine, funded by the US government, showed no benefit against the disease over standard care.
And in fact it showed use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with more deaths.
Bright said he would be asking the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate the Trump administration’s politicization of BARDA and its pressuring scientists to favor companies with political connections.
“Sidelining me in the middle of this pandemic and placing politics and cronyism ahead of science puts lives at risk and stunts national efforts to safely and effectively address this urgent public health crisis,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The 193 members of the UN General Assembly on Monday adopted by consensus a resolution that calls for “equitable, efficient and timely” access to any future vaccines developed to fight coronavirus.

The resolution also highlights the “crucial leading role” played by the World Health Organization, which has faced criticism from Washington and others about its handling of the pandemic.The resolution, which was drafted by Mexico and received US support, calls for strengthening the “scientific international cooperation necessary to combat COVID-19 and to bolster coordination,” including with the private sector.
The call for cooperation comes as research laboratories and pharmaceutical manufacturers launch expensive efforts to develop vaccines and other therapeutics that could be critical in fighting the pandemic, which has already killed more than 167,000 people and sent world economies into tailspin.
The resolution asks Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to “to identify and recommend options, including approaches to rapidly scaling manufacturing and strengthening supply chains that promote and ensure fair, transparent, equitable, efficient and timely access to and distribution of preventive tools, laboratory testing, reagents and supporting materials, essential medical supplies, new diagnostics, drugs and future COVID-19 vaccines.”
It also asks that such measures to develop and share treatments and vaccines are taken “with a view to making them available to all those in need, in particular in developing countries.”The resolution is the second adopted by the assembly about the new coronavirus pandemic.
The first one, adopted earlier this month, also called for international cooperation in fighting the spread of the disease.
The smaller UN Security Council has still not been able to agree on either of two draft resolutions — one proposed by Tunisia and the other by France — that would support the call made by Guterres last month for a global ceasefire as the world fights the pandemic.French and Tunisian representatives have since begun to merge the two drafts, according to diplomatic sources.

The President has offered the incentive to promote the country’s vaccine research and development as the government battles the spread of COVID-19 that has infected more than 6,000 in the country.“Dahil public enemy number one ang COVID-19 hindi lang dito sa Pilipinas kung hindi sa buong mundo, inanunsyo po ng Pangulo na siya ay magbibigay ng pabuya na hanggang P10 milyon sa kahit sinong Pilipino na makakadiskubre ng vaccine laban sa COVID-19 (Because COVID-19 is the public enemy not only in the Philippines but in the entire world, the President announced that he will give a reward of up to P10 million to any Filipino who will discover a vaccine in the fight against COVID-19),” presidential spokesman Harry Roque said during a Palace press briefing on Tuesday.
The President also promised to give a “substantial grant” to the University of the Philippines and UP-Philippine General Hospital for the development of a vaccine against the coronavirus, according to Roque.
Amid the escalating infections and death toll from the coronavirus, the global race is on to find and produce a COVID-19 vaccine. Medical studies on potential treatment to the coronavirus have reportedly been escalated in recent weeks.
In a recent virtual regional summit, President Duterte called for stronger collaboration on the research and development of a vaccine for the coronavirus. He said the Philippines is ready to participate in the clinical trials and medical studies of potential vaccines and medicines such as Avigan.The latest incentive for anti-viral treatment research was announced as the President continued to mull over options on whether to extend or modify the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in Luzon after April 30.
Roque said the President met with top government officials and health experts on Monday to get their inputs on the coronavirus response but has not yet decided on the post-April 30 scenario.
He said the President’s options included to “maintain/extend” the ECQ or implement a “modified quarantine” in areas with coronavirus cases. He insisted that there was no mention of total lockdown during the President’s meeting that lasted for five hours.Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles had earlier said that the President needed more time to make a decision on the next government action plan beyond April 30. Duterte tossed back the “several options” presented by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Cases (IATF) for further study and refinement.
The new coronavirus disease, which first broke out in China late last year, has infected more than two million people across the world, and left more than 160,000 dead. The Philippines has recorded 6,459 cases of coronavirus, including 428 fatalities as of April 20. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

A COVID-19 vaccine may be the only thing that can bring back “normalcy,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday, hoping for just that before the end of the year.
“A safe and effective vaccine may be the only tool that can return the world to a sense of ‘normalcy,’ saving millions of lives and countless trillions of dollars,” he added during a video conference with the 50 or so African countries that are members of the United Nations.He called for its accelerated development and accessibility to all, adding it must have a “universal global benefit” and “allow us to control the pandemic.”
“We need an ambitious effort to ensure that international stakeholders operate through a harmonized, integrated and leveraged approach to maximize the speed and scale needed for the universal deployment of such a vaccine by the end of 2020,” he insisted.
Guterres said his appeal on March 25 for $2 billion in donations for a comprehensive UN humanitarian response to the pandemic had so far raised about 20 percent of that amount.
Through the World Health Organization, the United Nations has been able to equip 47 African countries with COVID-19 tests, he said.The UN chief also praised the efforts of several African governments to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic.
He cited Uganda, which has given businesses more time to file their tax returns; Namibia, which provides emergency income for workers who have lost their jobs; Cape Verde, which provides food aid; and Egypt, which has reduced taxation on industries. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

Despite the increasing number of patients recovering from COVID-19, the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) said that there is still no “magic drug” for the dreaded disease.
The Department of Health on Thursday said there are now 435 patients who have recovered from COVID-19. The figure has outnumbered the country’s death toll, which is at 362.“Wala pa talaga tayong ‘magic drug’ na tinatawag, o epektibong gamot na napag-aralan o na-establish sa mga clinical trial na epektibo at safe na gamitin para sa COVID-19,” PSMID President Dr. Marissa Alejandria said in a press briefing.
([We do not have a ‘magic’ drug yet, or a drug that has been established in clinical trials as effective and safe for treating COVID-19.)
Alejandria said the medical professionals are providing supportive care for the COVID-19 patients.
“Sinisisguro natin na sila ay well-hydrated. Pag may lagnat, binibigyan po natin ng paracetamol. Ini-examine din naman kung meron silang ibang infection,” she explained.(We ensure that they are well hydrated. If they have fever, we give them paracetamol. We are also monitoring if they have other infections.)
“Kung may iba silang karamdaman katulad ng hypertension, diabetes, binabantayan din namin iyon,” she added.
(We also monitor if they have co-morbidities such as hypertension or diabetes.)Alejandria said as of now, the drugs being eyed as possible cures for COVID-19 remain investigational.
“There remains no registered, effective drug or vaccine for COVID-19. All of those are still undergoing research or clinical trials,” she said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

By Agence France-Presse
A COVID-19 vaccine may be the only thing that can bring back “normalcy,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday, hoping for just that before the end of the year.
“A safe and effective vaccine may be the only tool that can return the world to a sense of ‘normalcy,’ saving millions of lives and countless trillions of dollars,” he added during a video conference with the 50 or so African countries that are members of the United Nations.He called for its accelerated development and accessibility to all, adding it must have a “universal global benefit” and “allow us to control the pandemic.”
“We need an ambitious effort to ensure that international stakeholders operate through a harmonized, integrated and leveraged approach to maximize the speed and scale needed for the universal deployment of such a vaccine by the end of 2020,” he insisted.
Guterres said his appeal on March 25 for $2 billion in donations for a comprehensive UN humanitarian response to the pandemic had so far raised about 20 percent of that amount.
Through the World Health Organization, the United Nations has been able to equip 47 African countries with COVID-19 tests, he said.The UN chief also praised the efforts of several African governments to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic.
He cited Uganda, which has given businesses more time to file their tax returns; Namibia, which provides emergency income for workers who have lost their jobs; Cape Verde, which provides food aid; and Egypt, which has reduced taxation on industries. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

GENEVA – The novel coronavirus is 10 times more deadly than swine flu, which caused a global pandemic in 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Monday, stressing a vaccine would be necessary to fully halt transmission.
The WHO said there are 70 coronavirus vaccines in development globally, with three candidates already being tested in human trials, as drugmakers race to find a cure for the deadly pathogen.

(WHO) ahead of a meeting of the Emergency Committee on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Geneva, Switzerland, January 30, 2020. (REUTERS / Denis Balibouse / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)The furthest along in the clinical process is an experimental vaccine developed by Hong Kong-listed CanSino Biologics Inc. and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, which is in phase 2.
The other two being tested in humans are treatments developed separately by US drugmakers Moderna Inc. and Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., according to a WHO document.
Progress is occurring at unprecedented speed in developing vaccines as the infectious pathogen looks unlikely to be stamped out through containment measures alone.
The drug industry is hoping to compress the time it takes to get a vaccine to market — usually about 10 to 15 years — to within the next year.Drugmakers big and small have jumped in to try to develop a vaccine, which would be the most effective way to contain the virus. Pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer Inc. and Sanofi have vaccine candidates in the preclinical stages, according to the WHO document.
CanSino said last month it received Chinese regulatory approval to start human trials of its vaccine.
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna — which has never put out a product — received regulatory approval to move quickly to human trials in March, skipping the years of animal trials that are the norm in developing vaccines. Inovio began its human trials last week.Decelerating slowly
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from Geneva that the organization was constantly learning about the new virus sweeping the globe, which has now killed nearly 115,000 people and infected over 1.8 million.
“We know that COVID-19 spreads fast, and we know that it is deadly, 10 times deadlier than the 2009 flu pandemic,” he said.
WHO says 18,500 people died of “swine flu” (H1N1), which was first uncovered in Mexico and the United States in March 2009, but the Lancet medical estimated the toll to be between 151,700 and 575,400.
The Lancet review included estimated deaths in Africa and SoutheastAsia that were not accounted for by the WHO.
The outbreak, which was declared a pandemic in June 2009 and considered over by August 2010, turned out to be not as deadly as first feared. Vaccines were rushed out, but in hindsight, the West, particularly Europe, and the WHO were criticized for overreacting at a time when annual influenza epidemics every year killed between 250,000 and 500,000 people, according to WHO.
Tedros lamented Monday that some countries are seeing a doubling of cases every three to four days, but stressed that if countries were committed to “early case finding, testing, isolating (and) caring for every case and tracing every contact” they could rein in the virus.
More than half of the planet’s population is currently staying home as part of efforts to stem the spread of the virus, but Tedros warned that “our global connectedness means the risk of re-introduction and resurgence of the disease will continue”.
He pointed out that while COVID-19 had accelerated quickly, “it decelerates much more slowly.”
“In other words, the way down is much slower than the way up,” he said, stressing that “control measures must be lifted slowly, and with control. It cannot happen all at once.”
“Control measures can only be lifted if the right public health measures are in place, including significant capacity for contact tracing,” he said.
Regardless of the efforts put in place, the WHO acknowledged that “ultimately, the development and delivery of a safe and effective vaccine will be needed to fully interrupt transmission.” SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

The public health crisis stemming from the coronavirus pandemic could last for two years if a vaccine is not discovered soon, President Duterte admitted Thursday (April 9).
According to the President, only a vaccine could put an end to the pandemic that has infected more than million people.

“COVID, anong sagot? Vaccine. Walang vaccine? COVID stays. Iyan ang totoo. Ibigay ko sa inyo ang totoo,” Duterte said in a taped public address past midnight.
(What’s the answer to COVID? Vaccine. No vaccine? COVID stays. That’s the true. I’m giving you the truth.)
“Sabihin ko sa inyo. Think of the COVID ganitong sitwasyon, tatakbo ito ng two years.” (I tell you. Think of the COVID situation, this will last for two years.)
Duterte, who recently ordered the extension of the Luzon-wide lockdown until the end of April, admitted that people will suffer if no vaccine is discovered to address the pandemic. The government earlier forecasted zero economic growth for the year due to the severe blow of the pandemic on the country.
“Kasi pagka hindi ito naayos, ang COVID, mapurnada talaga tayong lahat,” Duterte said.
(If COVID is not resolved, we will all fail.)
The President also claimed that he saw the health crisis coming and took pride that he was the first to declare a lockdown to curb the spread of the disease. He said he has been closely following the COVID story and studying the matter.
The enhanced community quarantine in Luzon began last March 17, a day after Duterte ordered a sweeping quarantine in Metro Manila that will be extended from April 12 to April 30 to curb the spread of the outbreak and give government more time to improve healthcare efforts to combat the disease.
“Ito nakikita ko na noon pa. Itong COVID na ito, sinusundan ko talaga ‘yan. Kasi sinasabi, come Johnny — ah come-Jimmy-lately [Johnny-come-lately] — hindi ho — ako ang pinakaunang lahat nag-lockdown, kasi nasusundan ko na ang istorya,” he said.
(I saw it coming then. I’ve been following the COVID stories. They were saying I was a Johnny-come-lately, but it’s not true. I was actually the first to order a lockdown because I was following the story.)
“At sabi ko, nagbabasa naman ako different sources of knowledge — Facebook, everything — lahat na ng what I can get my hands on to study the matter because Presidente ako. Dumating nga.”
(I was reading different sources of knowledge – Facebook, everything. Everything I can get my hands on to study the matter because I’m the President. And it actually arrived.)
As the number of the country’s cases of infections soared daily, Duterte assured the public that his government is taking steps to address the public health emergency and mitigate its impact on the economy and the people.
He said the government’s economic team would look for additional funds, including borrowing from lenders, to boost the government’s COVID response, including relief program for the affected sectors. He saw no problem with the borrowing program because the country has good credit standing.
“Marunong tayong maghiram at marunong tayong magbayad on time,” Duterte said.
(We know how to borrow and we know how to pay on time)
“So magkano utang natin (So how much do we owe)? Well, it could be — it could go into trillions,” he added.
Earlier, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said the economic team has put together a P1.17 trillion program to boost healthcare, provide aid sectors affected by the outbreak, and stimulate the local economy.
He said the Central Bank provided P830 billion in liquidity for the economy. They also plan to borrow US$5.6 billion from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to raise additional funds.
Dominguez also said the economy may have zero growth this year as the coronavirus has hit the country “in a very hard way.” The massive public spending to combat the pandemic may also bloat the budget deficit to 5.3 percent from 3.2 percent, he added.
“We are confident ho na we have the financial capability to bridge this problem of the — the COVID has brought us,” Dominguez said in the same public briefing as the President.
“So the program is to spend — first, to help the poorest families, and then to help the small and medium enterprises, and then to provide support for the companies that are supported by their banks,” he added. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

In his late-night public address Friday, President Duterte gave the assurance that the P275 billion budget to address the pandemic will not be pocketed by officials, but said it will run out fast.“Sabi ko may pera tayo. Hindi ba? O ngayon dumating, kailangan natin ng bilyon. Pero hindi ito tatagal. Dadating ito ng six months, patay na tayo,” he said.
(I said we have the money, right? Now it’s here, and we really need billions. But this will not last. It may last six months but beyond that, we’re doomed.)
“If they cannot come up with a vaccine, patay tayong lahat. Hindi tayo makalabas, hindi na tayo makatrabaho. Maglabas ka, patay ka.”
(We’ll all be dead. We cannot go out, we cannot work. If you go out, you die.)
Duterte said it was important for the people to stay at home to prevent the spread of the deadly disease.
“Kaya ang pinagbabawal kasi hindi matapos ito. Kaya kung ayaw ninyo, kayo na lang ang tapusin ko para maprotektahan ko ‘yung mga inosente na ayaw mamatay,” he said.
(That’s why we’re not allowing you to go out because it will not end otherwise. So if you don’t want to obey, it’s you I will end so I can protect the innocent who don’t want to die.)‘I decided fast’
President Duterte said it was a good thing that he responded swiftly to the threat of the coronavirus or the country would have more confirmed COVID-19 cases.
“Hindi ko sabihin, magpasalamat kayo nauna tayo ng ilang linggo. Nagdesisyon na kaagad ako kasi pinag-aralan ko na ang COVID,” he said.
(I’m not saying you should thank me because our response was ahead for a few weeks. I decided quickly because I studied COVID.)
“Sinusundan ko na ang coronavirus niyan because I read. Nagbabasa ako. Hindi na ako sabihin kung anong binabasa ko, basta binabasa ko. I keep posted myself.”
(I was already following that coronavirus because I read. I read. I won’t say what I’m reading, but I’m reading something. I keep myself posted.)
As early as January, people had been clamoring for the government to impose a travel ban from China where the disease originated. However, the President said he was not keen on banning travelers from China.
“Mahirap ‘yang ano, sabihin mong (It is hard to say that) you suspend everything because they are not also suspending theirs and they continue to respect the freedom flights that we enjoy,” he said then.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III was also reluctant to recommend banning travelers from China from entering the country.
“If we do this, then the concerned country — China in this case — might question why we’re not doing the same for other countries that have reported confirmed cases of novel coronavirus,” he said.Meanwhile, President Duterte said he was frank about the virus from the very beginning and even warned the public that a disease will come.
“Right at the beginning, I was very frank and very emphatic about it. Not really in strong words. Sinabi ko may dadating na sakit (I said a disease will come),” he said.
“Walang gamot ito. Ang gamot nito ang katawan mo lang. Hindi ito TB. Hindi ito ‘yung nasugatan.”

The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) has already initiated contact for possible collaboration with its bilateral partners to aid in the COVID-19 situation in the country.
In a statement, the agency said it has specifically expressed its willingness to collaborate with other countries on clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccine development, that will help not just the country but also all countries affected by this pandemic.To date, the DOST has already received positive feedback from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on a possible vaccine development collaboration. Initial talks with both DOST and CAS scientists and experts will commence to determine their next steps.
Subsequently, the British Embassy in the Philippines has already shared six projects related to COVID-19 that was approved by its Medical Research Council (MRC).
These projects were already shared for review and identification by the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD), where local experts prefer to participate with reference to COVID-19’s vaccine development.

https://mb.com.ph/2020/03/25/manufacturing-firm-on-a-rush-to-develop-covid-19-vaccine-from-tobacco/,Manufacturing firm on a rush to develop COVID-19 vaccine from tobacco,by manilabulletin_admin,"Published March 25, 2020, 12:00 AM","
Medicago, a Canada-based company, announced that it now focuses on developing a plant-based vaccine against coronavirus disease which it hopes to submit for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration very soon.
Medicago said it successfully produced a Virus-Like Particle (VLP) of the coronavirus just 20 days after receiving the genetic sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2), the virus responsible for COVID-19.
This is the breakthrough first step in developing a vaccine.Medicago already uses a plant-based technology to develop vaccines for seasonal flu, but is now working on developing a vaccine for COVID-19.
Instead of working with live virus in chicken eggs as a bioreactor, Medicago uses tobacco plants in what it describes as a faster and more efficient process of producing proteins.
The company said that using tobacco plants and genetically engineered agrobacteria works faster than using eggs.
It also makes the vaccine easier to produce at scale. The company believes that tobacco plants are “highly efficient at producing proteins of varying complexity, serving as mini-factories for our vaccines.”With its plant-based technology, Medicago researchers insert a genetic sequence into agrobacterium, a soil bacteria, which is taken up by the subject plant Nicotiana benthamiana—known as a close relative to tobacco.
The plant develops the protein that can be used as a vaccine.
“The pace of our initial progress in COVID-19 is attributable to the capability of our plant-based platform which is able to produce vaccine and antibody solutions to counteract this global public health threat. The ability to produce a candidate vaccine within 20 days after obtaining the gene is a critical differentiator for our proven technology. This technology enables scale-up at unprecedented speed to potentially combat COVID-19.” said Dr. Bruce Clark, CEO of Medicago.Medicago researchers discovered that tobacco, with its ideal big leaves, is much better as a subject plant because it is hearty and grows quickly.
Clinical grade plant material can be produced in a little more than a month.
The company believes the process is a better way to cultivate the vaccine.
Medicago has a 97,000-square-foot greenhouse in North Carolina where it grows Nicotiana benthamiana—a flowering plant endemic to Australia and known as close relative to Nicotiana tabacum or tobacco plant.
The company grows the plants in Durham’s Research Triangle Park, the leading and largest high-technology research and science park in North America, not for cigarette production but for use in testing and development of the seasonal flu vaccine.Amid the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Medicago decided to focus on the development of COVID-19 vaccine this time.
Medicago researchers said if the virus begins to mutate, as is expected for COVID-19, they can update the production using new plants.
In its announcement, Medicago said it will initiate preclinical testing for safety and efficacy of the vaccine.
If approved by the FDA, the company expects to begin human trials by July or August.
Medicago said it also began using its technology platform to develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in collaboration with the Laval University’s Infectious Disease Research Centre.
The antibodies could potentially be used to treat people infected by the virus.
The university program is headed by Gary Kobinger, who helped develop a vaccine and treatment for Ebola.
Medicago said it is great to develop something positive from a plant with a negative stigma such as tobacco.
The potential of turning a plant that has been associated with harm to preserve life is a positive development.
Medicago is a Quebec-based company that is partly owned by Philip Morris Investments, a part of Philip Morris International whose research, development and production signal a tectonic shift in its core business operation as it moves away from traditional cigarettes to heated tobacco products.
Medicago’s application is pending FDA approval and will need to go through rigorous clinical trials.
Medicago CEO Bruce Clark said that once approved, the company could produce as many as 10 million doses a month and the vaccine could become available by November 2021. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

By Bernie Cahiles-Magkilat
More than 20 vaccines and a number of antiviral medicines are in development as the global pharmaceutical industry races against time to find cures and preventions for COVID-19, the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP) reported.
As of today, PHAP said, there are at least 14 companies with a medicine for COVID-19 in early phase research, 4 companies with a medicine in Phase I of development and 3 in Phase II, and one company has a medicine in Phase III trials. A clinical trial is a carefully designed study which provides scientific information needed to weigh the benefits and risks of a new medication and decide whether it is safe for patients.PHAP President and MSD Philippines President Dr. Beaver Tamesis said the industry is also scaling up capacity of diagnostics for testing for COVID-19 patients. PHAP is a member of the Geneva-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA).
Tamesis said the industry commits to accelerate its effort to use its skills, technology and resources to bring safe, effective diagnostics, treatments and vaccines to patients as a matter of urgency.
“We are seeing an unprecedented response on the part of the pharmaceutical industry to help put an end to this pandemic. As a science driven sector, we are in the unique position to partner with the government and the healthcare community to support efforts in this time of health crisis. We support government efforts, and recognize the immense role of our healthcare workers and the people in the pharmaceutical sector who are dedicating and risking their lives to contain this pandemic,” said.
On vaccine development, experts are hoping it will take as little as 12 to 18 months before there is a vaccine available. The IFPMA, representing the world’s leading biopharmaceutical companies, estimates that this is a best-case estimate that assumes one or two of the first few vaccines that enter development will be successful. In non-pandemic environments, only approximately one in ten experimental vaccines make it all the way through to regulatory approval.In its update, the IFPMA also said that there are nearly 80 clinical trials for experimental new treatments and vaccines in development for coronaviruses including COVID-19, Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia, SARS and MERS.
The IFPMA said that pharmaceutical companies have also been manufacturing thousands of doses of investigational and previously approved medicines that could treat coronavirus for emergency use and for use in clinical trials around the globe, including compounds formerly tested on other viral pathogens such as Ebola and HIV. Potential treatments include both antiviral medicines and immunotherapies.
Pharmaceutical companies that are undertaking massive research for COVID-19 treatments have presence in the Philippines. These are AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, and Takeda.Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies engaged in the research and development of vaccines operating in the Philippines are GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Sanofi.
Rolling out diagnostics to detect whether patients are genuinely infected with the new coronavirus is a key step in preventing or slowing its spread. The pharmaceutical industry is also scaling up capacity of diagnostics for testing for COVID-19 patients as much as possible. Pharmaceutical companies Roche and Takeda, also present in the Philippines, are in the forefront of these efforts.
Meanwhile, PHAP Members are working to ensure an unhampered movement of medicines throughout the country, calling on the government to facilitate policies that will aid them in the process.
“We support government efforts to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. We continue our operations despite the challenges brought about by the enhanced community quarantine. PHAP Members are employing supply chain strategies so that medicines, vaccines and diagnostics needed by healthcare professionals and patients are available at the time they need them,” said PHAP Executive Director Teodoro Padilla.
Padilla added that PHAP Members are also working to protect the health of the people in the pharmaceutical industry as they perform the critical task of ensuring medicine availability during public health emergencies.“The healthcare system is facing enormous pressure and we want to contribute by helping secure pharmaceutical supply chain, and by protecting the health of our people. The men and women in the pharmaceutical industry are front liners themselves, and we commend them for the work they do for us,” said Padilla. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

President Duterte is optimistic that Russia, the United States, and Japan could develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus disease “in a matter of days.”

Amid the global outbreak of the coronavirus, the President said the best and brightest scientific minds are expected to work “overtime” for a potential vaccine.“With the great strides now of science, in a matter of days, I’m sure Russia — the brightest of the brightest — America, Japan, they are working overtime to come up with the vaccine,” Duterte said in an assembly of the country’s mayors in Pasay City.
“It takes time pero kaya na ng mga mundo. Kaya na ng mga gobyerno (but the world has the capability. The governments are capable), especially those who are rich in technology,” he said.
The coronavirus, which broke out in Wuhan, China, has spread to more than 100 countries including the Philippines in recent weeks. The global death toll has reached the 4,000 mark while more than 100,000 people have been infected.
In the Philippines, at least 33 cases of coronavirus have been reported, including one fatality.The President has placed the country under a state of public health emergency, mobilizing government resources to step up the prevention and control of the spread of the coronavirus. Duterte has expressed confidence that the coronavirus will eventually be defeated.
In his speech Tuesday, the President recognized that the coronavirus disease might stay “for a little while” but will eventually pass. “It’s here and I suppose it’s going to stay for a little while.”
Duterte noted that the world has previously experienced “great cleansing” such as the bubonic plague and Spanish flu pandemic.“Speaking of contagion, I have noticed that every epoch there’s always a great cleansing of — not really cleansing dirt — but cleansing in the number of people in this planet,” he said.
“The bubonic plague, mainly it is caused by the rodents or the rats, and the Spanish flu right — was it before or after the Second World War? I think it was during even the Second — the First World War rather. Mayroon talagang great spasm and marami…,” he added.
The President remained unfazed by coronavirus threat as he continued to defy the Presidential Security Group’s (PSG) advice to adopt a “no touch policy” in his public engagements.
“Kung hindi ka na umabot (If you don’t make it), that is really your destiny,” he said.
“Hindi mo na madala ‘yan sa handshake-handshake. Maski magpunta ka ng limang milyon na handshake diyan, ‘pag hindi mo pa panahon, hindi mo talaga panahon. Ganun lang ‘yan,” he said.
(You can’t contain it by limiting handshakes. Even if you had five million handshakes, if it’s not yet your time, it’s really not yet your time. That’s all it is),” he said.
Duterte said in jest that he opposed the stricter security protocol because he might miss his chance to meet beautiful ladies at events.
“Ang problema niyan, paano ‘yung magagandang babae nandito ngayon sa kwartong ito? (The problem is, how about the many beautiful women in this room now? It’s always nice to talk to a beautiful lady, corona or no corona, especially [when] she looks like a mutya (beauty queen) with a corona (crown) on her head,” he said. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

This development has the makings of a good book or even a movie.That is, if researchers find a way of using a puzzle game to create a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus.
The game is called Foldit, a crowd-sourced puzzle where players need to fold proteins to alter the behavior of viruses and consequently prevent the spread of disease, an article for Mashable Southeast Asia (SEA) said.Is this purely the stuff of science fiction? Not quite, as the developers of the game just this week added COVID-19 as one of the puzzles thatplayers need to solve.
It may be just a matter of time before someone sitting in front of the computer actually finds out a way of this current global threat that has already claimed thousands of lives.
What’s promising about this new development is that scientists can pitch in and try to find out a way of neutralizing the dreaded virus.
In the game, points are given to those who find solutions for modifying the genes of the virus. The more efficient or effective the solutions are, the higher the score.Developed in 2008, this game, Mashable SEA reported, helped researchers decode the AIDS virus.
Now, if only the best players of the game could actually spend enough time to decode COVID-19, we might all be literally a mouse click away from a vaccine – and quite possibly the highest score ever in Foldit. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

https://mb.com.ph/2020/02/25/needed-vaccine-info-on-how-covid-1-spreads/,Needed: vaccine & info on how Covid-1 spreads,by manilabulletin_admin,"Published February 25, 2020, 12:00 AM","The search for a vaccine for the coronavirus, now named Covid-19 by the World Health Organization,is underway worldwide. Four major groups of scientists and researchers are racing to develop a vaccine usingvarioustechnologies, backed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, set up in 2017in the wake of the ebola outbreak inin West Africa that killed 11,000 people.
The German pharmaceutical company CureVac in Tubingen, Germany, and Moderna Therapeutics ofPennsylvania,United States, are working together on a vaccinebased on ”messenger DNA” that wouldissue instructions to the body to produce the proteins to fight the virus.
Inovio, also ofPennsylvania, is working with Beijing scientists in research on the genetic coding of the virus to get the body’s cells to produce proteins similar to those on the surface of the virus. The immune system learns to recognize the proteins so it is ready to attack the virus when it enters the body.French scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris are modifying the measles vaccine to work against the coronavirus.
Australianresearchers at the University of Queensland are using “molecular clamp” technology” invented bythe university’s scientists to rapidly develop new vaccinesbased on the virus DNA sequence. The Australian scientistshope their vaccine will be ready in six months.
Even asresearch continues to develop a vaccine that will fight the virus, it seems there is yet no definite findingabout how thecoronavirus invades and infects a human victim. If this can be established, it will mean fewer victims for the vaccines to treat.
The “current understanding” on how Covid-19 spreads is largely based on what is known about similar viruses. It is believedto spread between people in closecontactwith each other (about six feet) viarespiratory droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs, and these droplets land on the mouths or noses of people and inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible, according to the Centerfor DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDCP) that a person can be infectedby touching a surface that has the virus, then touching the face. “Butthis is not the main way the virus spreads,” the CDCP said.The biggest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China wasthe Diamond Princess cruise ship forced to dock offshore in Yokohama, Japan, for two weeks. The China Center for Disease Contol and Prevention saidthe virus can also be transmitted along a potential fecal-oral route– via hands, food, and water where the microbes enterthe mouth or eyes or are inhaled. Itthus recommended strengtheningsanitation and hygiene measures, including drinking boiled water, avoiding eating raw food, implementing separate meal systems, frequent hand washing, disinfecting toilets, and preventing water and food contamination from patients’ stool.
The cases are beginning to go down in China but they are multiplying in Europe, in the Middle East, and in Asia. In time, there will be a vaccine that will stop the disease, just as other epidemics have been stopped before. In the meantime, we need more information about how Covid-19 actually spreads so thatmore preventive measures can be taken to supplement the search for a vaccine to cure infected persons.

The Pharmaceutical Association of the Philippines (PHAP), which represents the research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare sector in the country, vowed to immediately bring new vaccines and technologies to cure and detect coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) once these are available.
“Once available, our goal is to immediately bring these life-saving innovations into the country in partnership with the government,” said PHAP President Dr. Beaver Tamesis.Tamesis stressed, “Now more than ever, there is need for strong public-private collaboration to contain health threats.”
He added that the role of the pharmaceutical industry is crucial in efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19. Pharmaceutical companies enable the research and development of innovations and technologies for the detection of the COVID-19, and in the ongoing search for its potential prevention and treatment.
Meantime, PHAP Executive Director Teodoro Padilla said
PHAP fully supports efforts that will enable the pharmaceutical sector to continue the work it has started in the research and development of potential vaccines and treatments for the COVID-19.
“We are also ready to support the government to contain this current health threat,” said Padilla.He echoed the call of Tamesis for stronger collaboration with the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
According to Padilla, PHAP member companies are also looking very closely at their supply chains to ensure that essential medicines and vaccines are available for Filipino patients.
“Our members have a continuity plan to ensure that the supply of needed diagnostics and medicines is uninterrupted during emergencies,” he said.Members of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) are developing new medicines and vaccines to help respond to the COVID-19 epidemic. R&D biopharmaceutical companies with potentially relevant knowhow have teams ofscientists checking their libraries for potential assets that could fight coronaviruses. PHAP is a member of the IFPMA, which represents the research-based pharmaceutical companies and associations across the globe.
PHAP shares concerns that the COVID-19, for which an antiviral therapy is yet to be developed, is a serious public health threat.
The speedy sharing of the pathogen sequence, followed by the declaration of the novel coronavirus as an international emergency, and the convening of a research and development forum, should further galvanize global collaboration with the private and public sectors for the timely development of vaccines and treatments, the IFPMA said.
As a science-driven sector, global pharmaceutical companies have reviewed their drug and vaccine portfolios to see if there is any research that could be helpful in tackling COVID-19. This includes efforts to identify suitable assets in their libraries that could be utilized in the fight against coronaviruses.
Relevant assets include diagnostics and biomarkers, approved therapies, or compounds in development that could be repurposed for use in treating patients with the coronavirus.Artificial Intelligence is also finding its place in the process, and is being used to mine through medical information to find drugs that might be helpful for tackling the novel coronavirus.Padilla noted that several biopharmaceutical companies are working with the Chinese government and research institutes in the United States and Australia to fast-track the development of vaccines against COVID-19. Biopharmaceutical companies like Johnson & Johnson announced that it has begun to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. GlaxoSmithKline, on the other hand, said that it is making its adjuvant technology available to support rapid development of candidate vaccines.
In addition to R&D efforts, many research-based biopharmaceutical companies with a presence in China are donating funds, medicines, diagnostics and medical protective products.
The IFPMA said that Johnson & Johnson has provided boxes containing laboratory-based investigations to the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention, which includes drug screening for anti-viral properties against the novel coronavirus. Pfizer, meanwhile, has made cash contributions to its global NGO partners that have shipped supplies to hospitals in China. Roche also donated diagnostic tests, medical supplies and financial support. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WHO Country Representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe emphasized the importance of frequent hand-washing, maintaining social distancing, and cough etiquette following the health concerns brought about by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19).“We have tried and tested measures that have been proven to be effective in controlling and preventing the spread of previous coronavirus diseases, and that is the basis on which we continue to advocate for personal hygiene, cough etiquette, and ensuring that you do social distancing if you have the (flu-like) symptoms,” said Abeyasinghe.
WHO-Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that a possible vaccine for the Covid-19 might be available in 18 months.
“We welcome the research community to develop the vaccine. But as our DG (director-general) mentioned, it is expected to take 18 months (to develop). So in the meantime, we need to do what we know works,” said Abeyasinghe.
“These measures have been clearly shown to be effective,” he noted.Abeyasinghe said that the recent advisory of the Department of Health that urges the public to avoid attending public gatherings for the time being was “an accepted measure.”
“It’s an internal matter that the government has decided. As you are aware to the best of our knowledge, there is no community level transmission in the Philippines. But taking measures to prevent the congregation of large of people is an accepted measure,” said the WHO official. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER

WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyrsus said on the agenda are easy-to-apply diagnostics, best approaches for infection prevention and potential therapies that could be used to treat COVID-19 patients.Also included in the discussion, the official said, is the acceleration of the development of potential COVID-19 vaccines.
“We’re also doing deeper investigations to identify the source of this virus and to prevent further transmission from animals to humans,” said Ghebreyuses in a statement released by WHO.
Currently, Ghebreyesus said WHO experts are developing a master plan for coordinating clinical trials to ensure that they are done “coherently and consistently.”
More than 300 health experts met in Geneva for a two-day forum aimed at addressing all the problems relating to COVID-19.The two-day forum was convened in line with the WHO R&D Blueprint – a strategy for developing drugs and vaccines before epidemics, and accelerating research and development while they are occurring.
“Research is an integral part of the outbreak response,” said Ghebreyesus.
“This outbreak is a test of solidarity — political, financial and scientific. We need to come together to fight a common enemy that does not respect borders, ensure that we have the resources necessary to bring this outbreak to an end and bring our best science to the forefront to find shared answers to shared problems,” he added.The meeting was hosted by the GloPID-R (the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness), a global alliance of international research funding organizations investing in preparedness and response to epidemics.
Among the topics discussed were:
• the natural history of the virus, its transmission and diagnosis;
• animal and environmental research on the origin of the virus, including management measures at the human-animal interface;
• epidemiological studies;
• clinical characterization and management of disease caused by the virus;
• infection prevention and control, including best ways to protect health care workers;
• research and development for candidate therapeutics and vaccines;
• ethical considerations for research;
• and integration of social sciences into the outbreak response.
The deliberations will form the basis of a research and innovation roadmap charting all the research needed and this will be used by researchers and funders to accelerate the research response. SIGN UP TO DAILY NEWSLETTER
